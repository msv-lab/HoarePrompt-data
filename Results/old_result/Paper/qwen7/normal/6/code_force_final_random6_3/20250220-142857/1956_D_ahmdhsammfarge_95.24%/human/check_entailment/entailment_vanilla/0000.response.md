Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to maximize the sum of the elements of the array `a` by performing a series of operations where we can choose any subarray and set all its elements to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray. The goal is to find the maximum possible sum and the sequence of operations to achieve it.

### Given Code Analysis

#### Function 1: `func_1(lst)`
- This function aims to find the optimal subarray to maximize the sum.
- It iterates through all possible subarrays and calculates the sum of the remaining parts plus the square of the length of the subarray.
- If a subarray has a higher sum than the current maximum (`over_sum`), it updates the indices (`r` and `l`) and the maximum sum.

#### Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`
- This function recursively generates the sequence of operations to set the subarray from `r` to `l` to the same value.
- It appends the operation to the list `ops` and recursively calls itself to generate further operations.

#### Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`
- This function sets the subarray from `r` to `l` to the MEX value of that subarray.
- It appends the operation to the list `ops`.
- If the minimum value in the subarray is 0, it appends another operation.
- It appends an operation to set the element at index `r` to the MEX value.
- It recursively calls `func_2` to generate further operations.
- It sets the subarray from `r` to `l` to the MEX value and returns the modified list.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The logic to find the optimal subarray seems correct. However, the sum calculation might not be optimal because it considers the square of the subarray length, which is not directly related to the MEX value.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function generates a sequence of operations to set a subarray to the same value. It correctly appends the operations to the list `ops`.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function sets the subarray to the MEX value and appends the necessary operations. However, the logic to handle the MEX value is not clear from the code. The MEX value should be calculated based on the current subarray, but the code does not explicitly calculate it.

### Conclusion

The given code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Specifically, the MEX value is not properly handled, and the sum calculation in `func_1` is incorrect. Therefore, the program will not produce the correct results.

**Correctness: False**
