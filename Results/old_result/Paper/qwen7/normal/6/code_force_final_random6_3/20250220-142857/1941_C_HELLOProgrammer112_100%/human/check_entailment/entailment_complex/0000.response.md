Reasoning:
The annotated program logic does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The key issue lies in the calculation of the minimum number of characters to be removed to make the string beautiful. Specifically, the program calculates the sum of the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' and subtracts the occurrences of 'mapie'. This approach does not account for the optimal removal of characters to eliminate the substrings 'map' and 'pie'.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate through the string and keep track of whether we have encountered 'm' or 'p' without immediately checking for 'ap' or 'ie'. Here's a more accurate approach:

1. Iterate through the string and maintain a count of how many characters need to be removed to avoid 'map' and 'pie'.
2. Use two flags to indicate if we are currently looking for 'p' after 'm' or 'e' after 'p'.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        remove_count = 0
        
        m_found = False
        p_found = False
        
        for char in s:
            if char == 'm':
                m_found = True
            elif char == 'p':
                if m_found:
                    remove_count += 1
                    m_found = False
                p_found = True
            elif char == 'i':
                if p_found:
                    remove_count += 1
                    p_found = False
            elif char == 'e':
                if p_found:
                    remove_count += 1
                    p_found = False
        
        print(remove_count)
```

This corrected program iterates through the string and removes the minimum number of characters necessary to ensure no 'map' or 'pie' substrings remain.

Given the above explanation, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
