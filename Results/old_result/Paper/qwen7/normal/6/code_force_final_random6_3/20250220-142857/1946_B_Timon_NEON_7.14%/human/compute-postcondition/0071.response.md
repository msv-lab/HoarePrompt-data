Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves `segment` and `segments_variants`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `segments_variants`. Inside the loop, `total_max_segment` and `segment` are compared, and if `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]`, `total_max_segment` is updated to be equal to `segment`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `total_max_segment` and `segment` are lists.
   - If `total_max_segment[0]` was less than `segment[0]`, `total_max_segment` would be updated to `segment`.
   - If `total_max_segment[0]` was not less than `segment[0]`, `total_max_segment` and `segment` would retain their original values.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is about to execute again, `segment` will be the next element in `segments_variants`.
   - `total_max_segment` will either retain its current value or be updated to the current `segment` depending on the condition.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `total_max_segment` and `segment`.

Since we don't know the exact values of `total_max_segment` and `segment` from the previous iteration, we can represent them as follows:

- If `total_max_segment[0]` was less than `segment[0]` in the previous iteration, `total_max_segment` would be updated to `segment`.
- Otherwise, `total_max_segment` and `segment` would retain their original values.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration can be represented as:

**State: **`total_max_segment` is the list that was either updated to `segment` or retained its original value, `segment` is the next element in `segments_variants`**.
