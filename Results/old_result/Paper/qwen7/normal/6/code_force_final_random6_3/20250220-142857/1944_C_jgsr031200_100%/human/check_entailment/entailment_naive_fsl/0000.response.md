Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program attempts to solve a different problem related to frequency counts of elements in the array, rather than determining the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
1
0
```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
0
0
0
```

This is incorrect because the program does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob make optimal moves to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c`, respectively. Instead, it simply prints the first available index that has a frequency of less than 2, which is not the correct approach for this problem.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.
