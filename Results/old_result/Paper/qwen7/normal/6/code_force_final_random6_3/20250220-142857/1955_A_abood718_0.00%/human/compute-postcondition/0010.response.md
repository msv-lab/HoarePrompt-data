Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `A` is the first integer entered, `B` is the second integer entered, and `C` is the third integer entered; `B * 2 < C` holds true; `X` is `A // 2`.**

This means that `X` is assigned the value of `A` divided by 2 using integer division. The values of `t`, `A`, `B`, and `C` remain unchanged from their initial conditions, and the condition \(B * 2 < C\) still holds true.
