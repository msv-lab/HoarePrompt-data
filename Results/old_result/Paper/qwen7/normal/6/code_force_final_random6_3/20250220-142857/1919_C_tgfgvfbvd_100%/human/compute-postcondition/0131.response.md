Postcondition: `x` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` have swapped values if `a > b` is true, otherwise `a` remains as `l[1]` or the original value of `b`, and `b` remains as `l[1]` if `l[2] <= a` is true, otherwise `b` remains the original value of `a`. Additionally, `c` is 1 if `l[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, otherwise `c` is either retained from its original value or incremented by 1.
