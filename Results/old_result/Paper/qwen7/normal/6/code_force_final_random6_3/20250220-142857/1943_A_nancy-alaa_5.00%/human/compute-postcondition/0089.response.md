Postcondition: `first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer (i+1), `n` is an integer greater than 0, and if `i` is in the keys of `mpp` with `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp` or the condition `mpp[i] == 1 and first` is false, there is no change in the values of `first`, `i`, and `n`.
