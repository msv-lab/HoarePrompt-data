Output State: **`bullets_used` is `health`, `total_bullets_needed` is `health`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, the first element of the first tuple in `monsters` is `pos`, the second element of the first tuple in `monsters` is `health`, `can_survive` is `False`, and `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`.**

Explanation: The code `bullets_used += health` updates the value of `bullets_used` by adding the value of `health` to it. Since `health` is the initial value of `total_bullets_needed`, `bullets_used` now equals `health`. All other variables remain unchanged.
