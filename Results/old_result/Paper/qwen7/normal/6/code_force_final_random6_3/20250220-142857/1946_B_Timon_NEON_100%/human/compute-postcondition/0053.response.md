Output State: **`segments_variants` is a list of segments, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the current element of `arr` and its index with the first element increased by `arr[i_end+1]`, `max_segment` is the best segment found so far based on the sum comparison with `max_segment[0]` increased by `arr[i]`, and `max_sum` remains -1. If `new_segment` is non-empty, `new_segment` is added to `segments_variants` and `max_segment` is updated accordingly. If `new_segment` is empty, `segments_variants` remains unchanged, and `max_segment` is updated based on the current element of `arr` and its index. `i` is `i_end + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`. All other variables remain in their previous states unless explicitly modified by the code, which in this case, they are not.
