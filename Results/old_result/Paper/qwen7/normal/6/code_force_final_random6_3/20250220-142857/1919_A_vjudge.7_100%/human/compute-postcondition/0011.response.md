The only objects in the loop head are variables `t` and `test`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t` and `test`. If `t` is less than `test`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `test` must be at least 1.
- `t` is the current value of the loop variable, which is less than `test`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `t` becomes `t + 1`.

Since `test` must remain at least 1, it does not change.

State: **`test` must be at least 1, `t` is `t + 1`**
