Output State: **`ans` is updated to `min(ans, cnt)`, `cnt` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same, `a` is the same, `tmp` is the same.**

Explanation: The code sets `cnt` to 0. This updates the value of `cnt` from its previous state based on the previous iteration. The other variables (`ans`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
