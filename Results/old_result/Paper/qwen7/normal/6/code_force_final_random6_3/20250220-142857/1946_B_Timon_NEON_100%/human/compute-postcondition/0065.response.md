Output State: **`segments_variants` now contains `max_segment` plus the element `len(arr) - 1`; `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` remains the segment with the highest sum found throughout the entire iteration; `max_sum` remains -1.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to `segments_variants`. Specifically, it adds the concatenation of `max_segment` (the segment with the highest sum found so far) and the element `[len(arr) - 1]` (which is a list containing the last index of the array `arr`). The other variables remain unchanged: `new_segment` stays as an empty list, `max_segment` retains its value from before, and `max_sum` remains -1 since no new maximum sum was found.
