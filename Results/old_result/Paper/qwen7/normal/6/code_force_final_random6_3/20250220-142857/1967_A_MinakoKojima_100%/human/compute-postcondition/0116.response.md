Output State: **`k` is 0, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`, and `res` is now `k % (i + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code sets `k` to 0. Since `k` is now 0, the expression `k // (i + 1)` evaluates to 0 and the expression `k % (i + 1)` also evaluates to 0. Therefore, `ans` is increased by 0 and `res` is now 0.
