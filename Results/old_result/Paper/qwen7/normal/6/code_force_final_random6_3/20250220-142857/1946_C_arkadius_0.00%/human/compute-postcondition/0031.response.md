Postcondition: `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by either 1 (if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`) or `tree.vertices[u].good_components'` (if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`). Additionally, `tree.vertices[u].good_components'` remains unchanged in both cases. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size'` is only increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size'` when `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`.
