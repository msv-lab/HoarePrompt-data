The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns two integers `r` and `l`, both fixed at 2 and 5 respectively. It calculates the sum of elements excluding pairs of indices `(i, j)` and finds the pair that maximizes the sum of the excluded elements plus a quadratic term based on the distance between indices. However, the returned values `r` and `l` are hardcoded to 2 and 5 regardless of the input list.
