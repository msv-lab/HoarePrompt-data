Postcondition: `i` is 2, `j` is greater than 5, `r` is 2, `l` is 5, `over_sum` is `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:2]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1). If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `sm` remains unchanged. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `i`, `j`, `r`, `l`, `over_sum`, and `sm`.
