Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, `c` is the third integer entered, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The other variables (`t`, `q`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
