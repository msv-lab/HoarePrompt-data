Output State: **`k` is decreased by 1, `mx` is max(0, cur + k * a[s]), `cur` is `a[s]`, `vis[s]` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `mx` is determined by the formula `max(0, cur + k * a[s])`, which uses the updated value of `k`. The values of `cur` and `vis[s]` stay the same as they were initially.
