Output State: **`distance` is the absolute value of `pos`; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`**

Explanation: The code assigns the sum of `bullets_used` and `health` to the variable `total_bullets_needed`. The initial state of `distance` being the absolute value of `pos` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes both the updated value of `total_bullets_needed` and the unchanged value of `distance`.
