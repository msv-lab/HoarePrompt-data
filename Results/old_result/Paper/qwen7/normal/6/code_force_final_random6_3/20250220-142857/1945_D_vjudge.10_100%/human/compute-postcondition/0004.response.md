Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `pergunta` is the minimum between the current value of `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `i` is less than `m`.**

Explanation: The line `pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])` updates the value of `pergunta` to be the minimum between its current value and `x + a[i]`. Since `a[i]` is part of the list `a` and `i` is `n-1`, this means `pergunta` is updated to the smaller value between `pergunta` and `x + a[n-1]`. The conditions for `n` and `i` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.
