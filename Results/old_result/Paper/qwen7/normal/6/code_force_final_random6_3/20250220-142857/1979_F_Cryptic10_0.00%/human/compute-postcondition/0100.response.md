Output State: **`d` is `n-3`, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`, `u` is still the return value of `func_1(d)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where the code was originally placed. The values of the variables `d`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged, and the action of removing `v` from `remaining_vertices` is completed.
