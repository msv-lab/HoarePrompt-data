Output State: `sng` is a non-empty sequence, `sz` is `k` + `len(sng)`, and we break out of the loop.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `sz` will be equal to the length of `sng` plus the initial value of `k`. The loop breaks once `sz` reaches or exceeds `k`, so if there are `n` elements in `sng`, `sz` will be `k + n` when the loop finishes.
