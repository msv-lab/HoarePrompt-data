Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0
- `n` is the number of elements in `sng`
- `rdb` is an empty list
- `sz` is 0
- We break out of the most internal loop or if statement

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement is trying to print the value of `elem` followed by a space (`end=' '`). However, there is no explicit definition of `elem` in the initial state. Since `elem` is not defined, it is likely a placeholder or a variable that would be set within a loop or conditional block that is not described in the initial state.

Given the information, we cannot determine the exact value of `elem` because it is not initialized or defined in the provided initial state. Therefore, the print statement will attempt to print `elem`, but since `elem` is undefined, it will print `None` by default in Python.

Output: **None**
