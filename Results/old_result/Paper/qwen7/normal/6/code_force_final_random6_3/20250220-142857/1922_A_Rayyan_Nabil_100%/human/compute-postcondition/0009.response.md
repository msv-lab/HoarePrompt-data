Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is an input string of length `n`, `b` is an input string of length `n`, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `_` is 1, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input().strip())` takes an input, strips any leading and trailing whitespace, and converts it to an integer. This changes the value of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged, including the precondition that `t` must be greater than 1, the lengths of strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, the fact that `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, and the state of the `results` list and the variable `_`.
