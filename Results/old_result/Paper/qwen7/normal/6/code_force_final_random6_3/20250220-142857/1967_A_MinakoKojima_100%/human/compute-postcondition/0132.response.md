Output State: **`i` is `x + 1`, `n` is `y`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, and `ans` is `ans + dif`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += dif` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `dif`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `dif`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `ans` which is the original value of `ans` plus `dif`.
