Output State: **The value of `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 3, and the current value of `ul` is equal to the current value of `ur`. The loop or if statement we were inside is broken out of.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the loop or the innermost enclosing block (if statement) where it is placed. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement without changing the values of `i`, `n`, `r`, `a`, `ur`, or `ul`. The only change is that we exit the loop or if statement, which is mentioned in the output state.
