Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `k` is a non-zero integer, `a` is the first element of `nums` after removing the leftmost element, `b` is the last element of `nums` after removing the rightmost element, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial conditions because no operations are performed on them within this line of code. Therefore, the only change is that `ans` is increased by 1.
