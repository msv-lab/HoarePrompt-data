Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided functions and the given test cases to determine the correctness of the program.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` aims to calculate the number of tents required for `extroverts` and `universals`.
- The condition `if extroverts % 3 != 0 and extroverts % 3 + universals < 3` is checking if there are leftover extroverts that cannot form a complete group of 3.
- If this condition is true, it returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to form a complete group of 3 with the remaining extroverts and universals.
- Otherwise, it returns `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`, which calculates the number of tents needed.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- The function `func_2` calls `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals`.
- If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to form complete groups of 3, and thus it returns `-1`.
- Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the result of `func_1`.

### Detailed Test Case Analysis:
Consider the test case `1 4 1` (1 introvert, 4 extroverts, 1 universal):
- `func_1(4, 1)` checks if `4 % 3 != 0` (which is true) and `4 % 3 + 1 < 3` (which is false).
- Since `4 % 3 + 1 >= 3`, `func_1(4, 1)` returns `ceil((4 + 1) / 3) = 2`.
- `func_2(1, 4, 1)` then returns `1 + 2 = 3`.

This is indeed incorrect because it fails to recognize that there are 4 extroverts and only 1 universal, making it impossible to pair all extroverts with two others. The correct output should be `-1`.

### Corrected Logic:
To fix this, we need to ensure that the number of extroverts can be fully paired with universals and other extroverts. We can add a check to see if the number of extroverts is less than or equal to twice the number of universals plus the number of extroverts that can be paired with another extrovert.

Here is the corrected `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts > 2 * universals:
        return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
```

With this correction, let's re-run the test case `1 4 1`:
- `func_1(4, 1)` now checks if `4 > 2 * 1` (which is true).
- Therefore, it returns `None`, and `func_2(1, 4, 1)` returns `-1`.

This matches the expected output.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issue with the current implementation. The corrected logic ensures that the program handles the case where it is impossible to pair all extroverts correctly.

Final: **True**
