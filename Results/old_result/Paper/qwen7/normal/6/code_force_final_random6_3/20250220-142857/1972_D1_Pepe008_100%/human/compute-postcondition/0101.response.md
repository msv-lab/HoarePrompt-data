Output State: `t` is `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `info` is an integer `a`, `b` must be at least 4, `suma` is the sum calculated based on the loop's conditions, `i` is `b + 1`, and `x` is `a - (b * (b - 1)) // b ** 2 + 1`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `b + 1` because the loop runs from `1` to `b` inclusive. The variable `suma` will hold the total sum calculated during each iteration of the loop according to the given conditions. The value of `x` will be `a - (b * (b - 1)) // b ** 2 + 1`, which is the last value of `x` computed in the loop. All other variables (`t`, `info`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their final values after the loop's last iteration.
