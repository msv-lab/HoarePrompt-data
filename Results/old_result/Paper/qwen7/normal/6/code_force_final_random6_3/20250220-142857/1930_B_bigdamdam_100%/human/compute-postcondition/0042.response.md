Output State: The loop runs until `i` exceeds `n-1`. Given that `i` increments by 2 each iteration, the loop will run \(\frac{n}{2}\) times if `n` is even, or \(\frac{n-1}{2}\) times if `n` is odd. After all iterations, `i` will be `n-1` (if `n` is even) or `n-2` (if `n` is odd), `p` will contain the value of `ind` (which starts as `n-2` and decreases by 2 each iteration) at every even index up to the last even index before `i` becomes greater than `n-1`, and `ind` will be `-1` (if `n` is even) or `-3` (if `n` is odd).

To summarize, `i` will be `n-1` if `n` is even, or `n-2` if `n` is odd; `p` will have the form `[0, 0, ..., 0, ... 0, ind]` where `ind` is the value it had at the last iteration, which is `-1` if `n` is even and `-3` if `n` is odd; `ind` will be `-1` if `n` is even and `-3` if `n` is odd.
