Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list containing the elements `input()` and `n`.**

Explanation: The code `numbers.append(n)` appends the value of `n` to the list `numbers`. The initial state of `t` being greater than 0 and `n` being an input integer remains unchanged. The list `numbers` initially contains one element which is the result of `input()`, and after executing the code, it gains an additional element `n`.
