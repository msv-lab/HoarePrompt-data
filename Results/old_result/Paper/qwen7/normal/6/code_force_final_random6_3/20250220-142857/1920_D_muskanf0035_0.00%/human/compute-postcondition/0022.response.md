Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts an integer `t`, followed by `t` sets of inputs. Each set includes integers `n` and `q`, a list of `n` operations, and a list of `q` queries. It processes `n` operations on an array and then answers `q` queries based on the final state of the array after all operations are applied. The function prints the results of the queries for each set of inputs.**
