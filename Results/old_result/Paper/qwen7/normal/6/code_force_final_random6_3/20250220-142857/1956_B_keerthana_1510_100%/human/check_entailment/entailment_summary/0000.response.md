Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program attempts to calculate the number of unique integers in the sequence, which is done using the expression `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})`. However, this calculation does not align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the problem asks for the maximum number of points you can get, not the number of unique integers in your hand.

To solve the problem correctly, you need to simulate the game and consider Nene's optimal strategy. Here's a brief outline of what the correct solution should do:

1. Read the input for each test case.
2. For each card in your hand, determine how many points you can get by considering Nene's optimal moves.
3. Simulate the game to find the best possible outcome for you, taking into account that Nene will always try to maximize her score while minimizing yours.

The provided program simply counts the number of unique integers, which is not relevant to the game's scoring mechanism. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
