Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `d` in the range `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`. This means `d` takes values from `n-1` down to `0`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `path` is a list where it now includes the vertex `v` at the beginning.
   - `remaining_vertices` does not contain the vertex `v`.
   - `d` remains as `n-1`.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `d` is greater than or equal to `0`. Since `d` starts at `n-1` and decreases by 1 each iteration, the loop will continue until `d` becomes `0`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The variable `d` will be decreased by 1 for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, if the loop continues, `d` will be `n-2` (the value of `d` at the end of the previous iteration was `n-1`).

5. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`path` and `remaining_vertices`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`path` is a list where it now includes the vertex `v` at the beginning, `remaining_vertices` does not contain the vertex `v`, and `d` is `n-2`**.
