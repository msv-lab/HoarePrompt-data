Output State: **`vis[s]` is 1, `mx` is the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`, `cur` is increased by `a[s]`, `k` is decreased by 1, `s` is updated to `p[s]` and `cur` is now equal to `cur + a[s]`, `k` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `k -= 1` decreases the value of `k` by 1. All other variables (`vis[s]`, `mx`, `cur`, `s`) remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the updated state includes the decrement of `k` by 1.
