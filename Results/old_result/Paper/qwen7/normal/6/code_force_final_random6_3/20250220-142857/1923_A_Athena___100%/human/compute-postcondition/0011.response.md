Output State: **The first element of `a` is removed, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `res` remains 0.**

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the first element of `a` must be `0` for the loop to continue, after executing `a.pop(0)`, the first element of `a` is no longer `0`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
