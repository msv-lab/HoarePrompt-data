Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `temp` is now sorted version of `[a[n - 1], a[n], a[n + 1]]`, and `max` is `temp[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `max = temp[1]` updates the value of `max` to be the second element of the list `temp`. Since `temp` is already sorted, `temp[1]` is the second largest value among `[a[n - 1], a[n], a[n + 1]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
