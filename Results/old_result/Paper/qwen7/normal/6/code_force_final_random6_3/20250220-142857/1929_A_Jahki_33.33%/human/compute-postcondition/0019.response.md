Postcondition: **The variable `order` holds the count of adjacent pairs in the list `a` where the first element is greater than or equal to the second element. The variable `i` is set to `num2`, indicating the end of the loop. The list `a` and the value of `num2` remain as they were initially, unless they were modified outside the given loop. The condition `order != 0` is true.**
