Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element has been converted to an integer using `map(lambda x: int(x), a)`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` and is less than or equal to half of `k`**.

In more natural language: `T` is decremented by 1, `n` remains the first element of the list split from user input and converted to an integer, `k` is still greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element was converted from the input list, `l` is set to 0, `r` is set to `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) is decreased by `mi`, and `mi` is the smaller of the first and last elements of `a` and is less than or equal to half of `k`.
