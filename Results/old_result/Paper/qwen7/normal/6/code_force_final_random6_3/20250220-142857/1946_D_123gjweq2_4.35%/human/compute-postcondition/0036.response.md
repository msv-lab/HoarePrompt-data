Postcondition: `cur_arr` must be empty, `xor` is the result of XORing all elements in the original `cur_arr`, and `new_arr` contains either all the elements whose `bit`-th bit is 0 or all the elements whose `bit`-th bit is 1, in the order they were encountered. If the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0, `new_arr` contains elements whose `bit`-th bit is 0, and `thing1` is the maximum element in `new_arr` based on the `bit`-th bit. If the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 1, `new_arr` contains elements whose `bit`-th bit is 1, and `thing1` is -1.
