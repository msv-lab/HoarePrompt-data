Output State: **`sng` is a non-empty collection, the first element of `sng` is `elem`, and `sz` is an integer less than `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value (which was less than `k`) to `sz + 1`. Since `sz` was originally less than `k`, adding 1 to it means `sz` is now less than `k + 1`. The collection `sng` and its first element `elem` remain unchanged.
