Output State: **Postcondition: `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the loop or the most internal if statement without changing the values of `l`, `r`, `k`, or `sunks`. The conditions `l` is less than or equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]` remain valid as they were not altered by the code.
