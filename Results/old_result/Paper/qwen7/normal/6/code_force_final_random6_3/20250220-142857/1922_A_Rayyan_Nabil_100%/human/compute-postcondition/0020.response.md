Output State: `t` must be equal to 0, `n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the final input string stripped of leading trailing whitespace, `c` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration from 1 to `t`, and `_` is the current iteration index, which will be equal to `t` after the last iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be 0 because it decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values of the last inputs provided. The `results` list will contain the outputs of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each of the `t` iterations.
