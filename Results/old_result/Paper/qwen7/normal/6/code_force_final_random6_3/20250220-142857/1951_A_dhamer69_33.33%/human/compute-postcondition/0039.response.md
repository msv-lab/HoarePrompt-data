Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `s` is updated to the value of the input string, if `n` equals 2, `s` is either equal to '00' or not equal to '00', if `n` is not equal to 2, `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s` and `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())**.
