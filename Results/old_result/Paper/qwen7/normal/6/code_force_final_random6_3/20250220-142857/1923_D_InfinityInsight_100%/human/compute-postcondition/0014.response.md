Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `last` is a list with one additional element which is the same as the last element of the original list.**

Explanation: The code appends the last element of the list `last` to itself. This means the last element of `last` remains unchanged, but `last` now contains one more element, which is the same as the previous last element.
