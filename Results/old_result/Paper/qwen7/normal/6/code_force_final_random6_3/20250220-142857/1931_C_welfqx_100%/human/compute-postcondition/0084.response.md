Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, and either the element at index `j` of `num` is not equal to the element at index `j + 1` of `num`, in which case `f` is 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, or the element at index `j` of `num` is equal to the element at index `j + 1` of `num`, and no change occurs to `f`.
