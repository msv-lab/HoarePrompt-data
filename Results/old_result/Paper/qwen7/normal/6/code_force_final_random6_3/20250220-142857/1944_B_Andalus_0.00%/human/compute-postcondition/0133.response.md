Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in sng:`. This means the loop iterates over each element in the sequence `sng`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: The problem states that the loop has executed all its iterations, and `sz` is equal to `k`.

3. **Understand what needs to be adjusted**: We need to consider the variables and states that are part of the loop head. These include `elem`, `sng`, `sz`, and `k`.

4. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `sng`. After all iterations, `sz` (which likely represents the size or length of `sng`) is equal to `k`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop has completed all iterations, `sng` must have had at least one element for each iteration.
   - The variable `sz` (or `len(sng)`) must be equal to `k` after all iterations.

Given these points, we can conclude that the state before the loop starts should reflect that `sng` is a non-empty sequence and that `sz` (or `len(sng)`) is equal to `k`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sng` is a non-empty sequence, `sz` (or `len(sng)`) is equal to `k`**
