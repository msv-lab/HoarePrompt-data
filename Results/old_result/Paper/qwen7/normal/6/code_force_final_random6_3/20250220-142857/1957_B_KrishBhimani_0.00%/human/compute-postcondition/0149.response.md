Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in arr`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `c` is 8
   - `arr` is a list containing [1, 4, 8]
   - `i` is 1
   - `ans` is a list with the values [0, -1, 2]

3. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since `i` is currently set to 1 and it is iterating over the list `arr`, the next value of `i` will be the next element in the list `arr`. The list `arr` contains [1, 4, 8], so the next value of `i` will be 4.

4. **Check if the loop should continue**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `arr`. Since `arr` still contains elements (4 and 8), the loop will continue.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `arr`. `i` will be set to the next element in the list `arr`, which is 4. `arr` itself does not change; it remains the same list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`c` is 8, `arr` is a list containing [1, 4, 8], `i` is 4**
