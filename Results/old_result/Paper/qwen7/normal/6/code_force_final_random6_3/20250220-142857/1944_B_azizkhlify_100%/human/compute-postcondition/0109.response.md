Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `a` is a list of integers, `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, and `ul` equals `ur`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional statement is mentioned, we assume it breaks out of the context where it was used. All the initial conditions remain unchanged.
