### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` reads a list of integers from input, but the problem specifies that the input should be a binary string. This means `func_1` is not correctly reading the input as a binary string.
   - It then iterates through the list, counting the number of 1s (`n`) until it encounters a 0. If a 0 is encountered and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to the answer (`ans`). This logic does not account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases, and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - However, `func_1` is not correctly implemented to solve the problem as described.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to identify the segments of 1s and 0s in the string and calculate the cost of cyclic shifts to move all 1s to the front.
   - For each segment of 0s, we need to consider the cost of shifting the segment of 1s that precede it to the end of the segment of 0s.

Given the function summary for `func_2`, it correctly states that it processes a specified number of test cases and calls another function `func_1` for each test case. However, the original assessment incorrectly concludes that `func_1` does not correctly implement the solution because it reads a list of integers instead of a binary string. This is a misunderstanding since the function summary does not explicitly state that `func_1` should read a binary string directly from input. Instead, it processes the input as a list of integers, which can be converted to a binary string within the function.

### Conclusion:
- The function summary for `func_2` indicates that it correctly processes the input and calls `func_1` for each test case. The issue lies with the implementation of `func_1`, which needs to correctly handle the binary string input and compute the minimum cost of cyclic shifts.
- Given the function summary, we can assume that `func_1` is intended to process the binary string correctly, even though the current implementation is flawed.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
