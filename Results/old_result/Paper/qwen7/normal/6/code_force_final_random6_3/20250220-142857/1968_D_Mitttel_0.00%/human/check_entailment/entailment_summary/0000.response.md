Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly reads the input and processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the appropriate parameters. The input reading and splitting logic seems correct, and the function handles multiple test cases as required.
2. **Function `func_1`**: This function uses `calculate_score` to compute the scores for both Bodya and Sasha. The logic in `func_1` is straightforward and correctly compares the scores to determine the winner or if it's a draw.
3. **Function `calculate_score`**: This function is responsible for calculating the score for a given starting position. It correctly handles both non-cyclic and cyclic scenarios. The logic for detecting cycles and computing the score for the remaining steps is sound.

Given that all functions work together as described in the problem statement and the execution summaries match the expected behavior, the program should be correct.

Correctness: **True**
