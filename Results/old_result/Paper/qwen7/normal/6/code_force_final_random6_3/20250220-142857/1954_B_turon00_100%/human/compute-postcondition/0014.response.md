Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is equal to `min(ans, cnt)`, `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `cnt`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
