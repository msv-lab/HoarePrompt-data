Output State: **`i` is 3, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with its length greater than 2, `ans` is 1, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index 0 and having length 3, and the current value of `s` is either 'map' or 'pie'**.

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was initially 0, it now becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
