Output State: The loop will execute `x` times. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `x-1`, `x` remains unchanged, `s` will be \(2^{x} - 1\).

This is because each iteration of the loop doubles the previous value of `s` and then subtracts 1. Starting from `s = 1`, after the first iteration, `s` becomes 1, after the second iteration, `s` becomes 3 (which is \(2 \times 1 + 1\)), and so on. Therefore, after `x` iterations, `s` will be \(2^x - 1\).
