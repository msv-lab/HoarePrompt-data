Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element has been converted to an integer using `map(lambda x: int(x), a)`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `k` is adjusted according to the condition (either `k` is `k - mi * 2` or remains greater than 0), `a` is a list of integers where each element has been converted to an integer using `map(lambda x: int(x), a)`, `l` is either 1 or 0, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `ans` is either `ans + 1` or 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `t` is `k % 2` if `k` is greater than 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `k` is adjusted based on the conditions within the if-else block, `a` is a list of integers where each element has been converted to an integer using `map(lambda x: int(x), a)`, `l` and `r` are updated according to the conditions within the if-else block, `ans` is increased by 1 under certain conditions, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `t` is `k % 2` if `k` is greater than 0. Specifically, if `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is set to 2, `r` is set to `n - 3`, and `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is increased by 1, `t` is updated to `k % 2`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `l` < `r`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `a[l]` and `a[r]` are each decreased by `mi`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `l` is increased by 1, and `r` is decreased by 1. If `a[r]` equals 0, `r` is also decreased by 1. Otherwise, `t` is `k % 2`, and the values of `mi`, `l`, `r`, `t`, and `ans` remain unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
