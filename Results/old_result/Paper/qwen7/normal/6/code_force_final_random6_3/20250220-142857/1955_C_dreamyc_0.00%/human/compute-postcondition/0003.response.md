Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` must be non-zero, `nums` is a deque of `n-1` integers (after removing one element from the left and one from the right), `ans` is 0, `a` is the first element of the deque before popping, `b` is the last element of the deque before popping.**

Explanation: The code removes the first element (`a`) from the left end of the deque `nums` using `popleft()` and removes the last element (`b`) from the right end of the deque `nums` using `pop()`. The length of `nums` is reduced by 2, becoming `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged with their initial values.
