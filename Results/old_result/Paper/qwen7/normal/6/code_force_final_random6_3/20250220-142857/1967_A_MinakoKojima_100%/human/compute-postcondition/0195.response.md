Output State: **`i` is 0, `dif` is not equal to 0, `res` is -1, `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times `(i + 1)`, `ans` is `ans` plus `dif`.**

In this case, the code `ans += dif` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `dif`. Since `i` is 0, `dif` is not equal to 0, `res` is -1, and `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times `(i + 1)`, the only change is that `ans` is updated to its original value plus `dif`.
