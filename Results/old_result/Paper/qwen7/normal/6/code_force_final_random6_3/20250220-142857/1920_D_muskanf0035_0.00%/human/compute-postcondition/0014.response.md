The code reads two integers `n` and `q` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means `n` and `q` are now assigned the first and second integers from the input, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`queries` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is the first integer from the input, `q` is the second integer from the input, `operations` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers \(b\) and \(x\) where \(b \in \{1, 2\}\) and \(1 \leq x \leq 10^9\), `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, and `q` is the second integer from the input.**
