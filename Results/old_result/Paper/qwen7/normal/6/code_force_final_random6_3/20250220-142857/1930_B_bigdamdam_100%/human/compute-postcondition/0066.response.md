Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` starting from 0 up to but not including `n`, incrementing by 2 each time.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ind` is 12 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).
   - `i` is 14.
   - `p[i]` is 12 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, the next value of `i` would be `14 + 2 = 16`.

5. **Check if the loop can continue**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 14, so `n` must be greater than 14 for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`ind` is 12, `i` is 16, `n` must be greater than 16**
