Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the input value used to determine the range of the loop.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range of the input value. This means the loop will run as long as `i` is less than the input value.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - The input value is used to define the range of the loop, so it needs to be adjusted.
   - The variable `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, so its value needs to be updated.

4. **Initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `word` is a string based on the value of `n`.

5. **Next iteration requirements**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the input value.
   - The input value is the upper limit of the range for `i`.

Given the initial state at the end of the previous iteration, let's assume the following:
- The input value (let's call it `input_value`) was read from the user.
- `i` was the last value of `i` in the previous iteration.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must be less than `input_value`. Therefore, the input value remains the same, but `i` is incremented by 1.

So, the state adjustments needed are:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- `input_value` remains unchanged.

Since the problem does not specify the exact values of `input_value` and `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can represent the general state adjustment as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer, and `word` is a string based on the value of `n`. The input value remains the same, and `i` is incremented by 1.**

To be more specific, if we denote the input value as `input_value` and the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`, then the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`n` is an integer, and `word` is a string based on the value of `n`. The input value is `input_value`, and `i` is `i_prev + 1`.**
