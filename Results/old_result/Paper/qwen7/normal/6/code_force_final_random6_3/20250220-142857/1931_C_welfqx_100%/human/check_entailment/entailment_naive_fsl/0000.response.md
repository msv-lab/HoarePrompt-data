Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the array has multiple distinct segments that need to be made uniform. Let's consider an example:

**Example Input:**
```
5
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
6
8
```

However, the program outputs:
```
4
0
8
```

The program incorrectly calculates the minimum cost for the second and third cases. For the second case, the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` requires a cost of `6` (by setting the entire array to `1`), but the program outputs `0`. Similarly, for the third case, the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1]`, the program also outputs `8` instead of `6`.

The issue lies in the logic used to determine the maximum segment length (`cn` and `ck`). The program does not correctly identify the longest segment that can be made uniform in a single operation. A more accurate approach would involve identifying the longest subarray that can be made uniform without considering the reverse array separately.

To fix this, a better approach would be to iterate through the array and keep track of the lengths of consecutive segments that are the same, and then calculate the minimum cost based on these segments.
