Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `t` is the next line of input, `l` is the count of 'L' in `t`, `k` is `a[l - 1] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2`, `q2` is `l`**, the last character of `t` is 'L'.

Explanation: The code `q2 = l` simply assigns the value of `l` to `q2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
