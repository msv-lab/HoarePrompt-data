### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code follows the problem statement and accurately simulates the game for both players. Let's break down the key points to ensure the reasoning is sound:

1. **Input Reading and Preparation:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It adjusts the indices of the permutation and array to be zero-based, which is necessary for the game logic.
   - This part is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum possible score for a player starting at a given position for `k` turns.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the game turns, updating the score and position according to the rules.
   - The use of a `vis` array to avoid revisiting positions ensures that the simulation is efficient and correct.
   - This logic correctly simulates the game for one player.

3. **Game Outcome Calculation:**
   - After calculating the scores for both players using `func_1`, the code compares the scores.
   - It correctly prints 'Draw' if the scores are equal, 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, and 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher.
   - This part also aligns with the problem statement.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - The example provided in the problem statement is correctly analyzed.
   - Bodya's score is calculated as 9, and Sasha's score is calculated as 13.
   - The output 'Sasha' is correct, confirming the code's accuracy.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis and the example verification, the provided code correctly implements the game rules and calculates the scores accurately.

**Final: True**

The original assessment was accurate.
