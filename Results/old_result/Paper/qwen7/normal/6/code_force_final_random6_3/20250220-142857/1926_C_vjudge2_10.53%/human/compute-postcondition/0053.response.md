Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `n` and `numbers`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `n` and `numbers`**:
   - `n` is used in the loop as an iterator over the elements of `numbers`.
   - `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `numbers`.
   - The initial value of `i` is 21, and it increments by 1 each time through the loop.
   - The loop runs for 10 iterations, meaning `n` takes values from `numbers` one by one.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop runs for 10 iterations, `n` will take 10 different values from the list `numbers`.
   - The initial value of `i` is 21, and after 10 iterations, `i` will be 31 (since `i` starts at 21 and increments by 1 each time).
   - However, since the loop only runs for 10 iterations, the final value of `i` should be 30 (after 10 iterations).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be one of the elements in the list `numbers`.
- `numbers` must contain exactly `t` integers.

Since the loop runs for 10 iterations, the list `numbers` must have at least 10 elements. The exact values of `n` within the loop are not specified, but we know that `n` will be one of the elements in `numbers`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` must contain at least 10 integers, `i` is 21, `word` is '21', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 2, `sum_total` is 6, `values[11]` is 2, `sum_values[11]` is 1, `sum_values[12]` is 3, `sum_values[13]` is 6, `values[21]` is 3, `sum_values[21]` is 6**.
