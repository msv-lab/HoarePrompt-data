Output State: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive (decremented by 1), `n` is an input integer, `res` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `res = 0` initializes the variable `res` to 0. This does not affect the values of `a`, `t`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
