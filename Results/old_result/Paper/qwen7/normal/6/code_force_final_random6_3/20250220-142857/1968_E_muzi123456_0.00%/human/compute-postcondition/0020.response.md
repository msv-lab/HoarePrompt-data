Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`.
     - This implies that `t` must be 1 because if `t` were any number greater than 1, it would not satisfy the condition `t == t - 1`. Therefore, `t` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
     - The value of `n` is not specified, so it remains as `n`.
   - `i` is 1.
     - The value of `i` is explicitly given as 1.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print('1', end=' ')`.
     - This statement prints the string `'1'` followed by a space (`end=' '` ensures that the next print statement will continue on the same line).

Given this analysis, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **1**
