Output State: **`index` is 17 + 3 * n + 4, `PB` is an integer from `int(data[index + 2])`, `t` is `t - 2`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is an integer from `int(data[index + 3])`**.

Explanation: The line `index += 4` increments the value of `index` by 4. The other variables (`PB`, `t`, `results`, `k`, and `PS`) remain unchanged. The updated value of `index` is calculated as the original value (17 + 3 * n) plus 4.
