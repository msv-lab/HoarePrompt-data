Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `cur_arr`, a list of integers, and `bit`, an integer representing the current bit position. It returns the length of the list `cur_arr` if the second condition is not met. Otherwise, it returns either the maximum value between the maximum element found in `new_arr` when considering the `(bit - 1)`-th bit and the length of `new_arr`, or `thing1`, which is the maximum element in `new_arr` if the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0, otherwise it returns -1.**
