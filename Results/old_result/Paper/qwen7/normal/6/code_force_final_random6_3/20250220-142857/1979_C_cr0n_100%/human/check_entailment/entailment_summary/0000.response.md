### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to distribute coins among \(n\) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. Each outcome has a multiplier \(k_i\), and the total bet must be less than \(k_i \times \text{bet}_i\) for any \(i\).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers \(a\) and \(b\) using their greatest common divisor (GCD). This is not directly relevant to solving the main problem but is used in `func_2`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - **Input Processing**: Reads \(N\) (number of outcomes) and a list of multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_N\).
   - **Cumulative Denominator Calculation**: Initializes `den` with the first multiplier and iteratively updates it using `func_1` to find the LCM of `den` and each subsequent multiplier.
   - **Result Calculation**: Computes `vprod` as `den // r` for each \(r\) in the list of multipliers. This represents the maximum bet allowed for each outcome without exceeding the total bet.
   - **Validation and Output**: Checks if the remaining value (`den - sum(vprod)`) is positive. If not, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution exists. Otherwise, it prints the bets as a space-separated string.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the required conditions. It ensures that the total bet is minimized while ensuring the condition that the total bet is strictly less than the payout for any winning outcome.
   - The use of LCM in calculating `den` ensures that the bets are evenly distributed across all outcomes, maximizing the total bet while satisfying the problem constraints.
   - The final check ensures that the remaining value is positive, which guarantees that the total bet is indeed less than the payout for any outcome.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly solves the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
