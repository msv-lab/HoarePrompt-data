Reasoning:
1. The problem involves determining the winner of a game based on the parity (odd or even) of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
2. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b` (number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively).
4. It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`). If it is even, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.
5. This logic aligns with the game rules: if the sum of the coins is even, Bob wins; if it is odd, Alice wins.
6. The program handles multiple test cases as specified and prints the correct result for each case based on the given examples.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct according to the problem statement and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
