The code `a = int(a)` converts the string `a` into an integer. Since `a` was previously the first word of the input split and converted to an integer, its value remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word of the input split, `b` is the integer value of the second word of the input split, `t` is `b * 2`, and `t` is either unchanged if `t1 >= a`, or updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15 + 1` if `a - t1 % 15 != 0`, or `t + (a - t1) // 15` if `a - t1 % 15 == 0`.**
