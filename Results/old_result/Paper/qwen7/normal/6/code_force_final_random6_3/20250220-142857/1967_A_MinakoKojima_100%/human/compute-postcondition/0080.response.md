Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is a non-negative integer which has been decremented by `n-1` and further adjusted by subtracting 5 plus the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` if any `dif` is found to be zero, `n` must be at least 1, `ans` remains unchanged, `k` is partially consumed (not set to 0), `dif` is the difference between consecutive elements in list `a`, and `i` is incremented with each iteration.**
