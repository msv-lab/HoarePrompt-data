Output State: **`cou` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, and the loop continues.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no specific changes are made to the variables `cou` and `i` within the scope of the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged. The condition `i` must be less than `n + 1` also remains valid as the `continue` statement does not affect this condition.
