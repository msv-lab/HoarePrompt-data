Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for loop execution**: The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Specifically, the loop will run `t` times.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop will run `t` times, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute at all. Additionally, since the loop counter `_` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each time, we don't need to explicitly set its initial value; it will be set to 0 by the loop itself.

4. **Consider the given state**: The initial state is that `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `t` is equal to `int(data[0])`, `idx` is 2, and `results` is an empty list.

5. **Formulate the new state**: We need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. Therefore, we adjust the state to reflect this condition.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 2, `results` is an empty list**
