Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `t` from which `i` is derived.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Initially, `i` is set to 0 because the `range(t)` function generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop will start with `i` being 0, we need to ensure that `i` is 0 at the beginning of the loop. The value of `t` should also be correctly set based on the input.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is 0 and `t` is the value read from the input, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `t` should be the value read from the input, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `i` should be 0 since the loop starts with `i = 0`.

Thus, the state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 0**.
