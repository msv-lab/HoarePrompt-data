t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 \cdot 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ \min \Big(10^5, \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. Additionally, for each of the m lines describing pairs of friends, a_i, b_i, and f_i are integers such that a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9.
