Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head defines the variables `j` and `n`. These are the only variables that can be adjusted.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n - 2` (since `range(n - 1)` generates values from 0 to `n-2`). 

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - The condition inside the loop checks if `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`. If true, `f` becomes 0 and the loop is exited. Otherwise, no change occurs to `f`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `j < n - 1`. Given that `j` is now 2 and `n` must be greater than 1, the loop can continue if `n > 3`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 3 to ensure the loop continues.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3**.
