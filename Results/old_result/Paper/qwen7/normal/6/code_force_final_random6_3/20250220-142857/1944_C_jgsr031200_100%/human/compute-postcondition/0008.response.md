Output State: The `freq` list will contain the count of how many times each index from 0 to n (where n is the length of the `arr` list) appears in the `arr` list.

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the `freq` list will reflect the frequency of each integer in the `arr` list. Specifically, if the integer `j` appears `k` times in the `arr` list, then `freq[j]` will be equal to `k`. All other elements in the `freq` list (those indices that do not appear in `arr`) will remain as 0.
