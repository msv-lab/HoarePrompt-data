Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer reduced by 1, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input, `b[n - 2]` is either `'<'` or not `'<'`, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input integer, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. It also reduces the value of `n` by 1. The variables `t`, `b`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
