Output State: **The variable `t` will be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` will be the minimum value between the original `n` and \(2 * k - 2\), and `k` will be the last integer read from standard input during the loop's execution.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` retains its initial value within the range of 1 to 1000. The variable `n` is updated to be the minimum value between its original value and \(2 * k - 2\). The variable `k` takes on the value of the last `k` read from the standard input during any iteration of the loop.
