Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `sng` is a non-empty sequence, `sz` is `k` + `len(sng)`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `lst = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `lst`. The values of `T`, `sng`, `sz`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
