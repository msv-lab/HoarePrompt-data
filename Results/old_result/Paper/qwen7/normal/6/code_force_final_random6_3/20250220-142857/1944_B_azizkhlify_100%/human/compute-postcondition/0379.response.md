Given the initial state:
- `i` is 4
- `n` is less than or equal to 3

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

From the initial state, there is no explicit value given for `a`. Since `a` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its contents. Therefore, we cannot provide a precise value for `a[i]`.

However, based on the precondition, we know `i` is 4. If `a` were defined and had at least 5 elements (since `i` is 4), then `a[i]` would refer to the fifth element of the list `a`. But since `a` is not defined, we cannot proceed further with this assumption.

Given the lack of definition for `a`, the most precise description we can provide is that `a[i]` refers to the element at index 4 of the list `a`, assuming `a` exists and has at least 5 elements.

Output: **a[4] a[4]**
