Output State: **`r` will be `t`, `ii` will be `n - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `cn` will be the count of consecutive identical elements starting from the beginning of the list `num` up to index `n-2` plus the count of consecutive identical elements encountered during the loop execution (`ck`), `num` is a list, `ck` will hold the count of consecutive identical elements encountered during the loop execution, and it will be incremented each time two consecutive elements in `num` are found to be identical until a pair of non-identical elements is encountered or the end of the list is reached, `symb1` and `symb2` are equal.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer. All other variables remain in their initial state as described.
