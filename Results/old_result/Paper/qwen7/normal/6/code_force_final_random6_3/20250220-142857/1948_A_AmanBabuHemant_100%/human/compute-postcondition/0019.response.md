Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 49, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value entered by the user (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The initial conditions for `t` and `s` remain unchanged because no operations were performed on them within the given code snippet. Therefore, `t` still must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 49, and `s` remains either unchanged or set according to the initial conditions if `n` was even.
