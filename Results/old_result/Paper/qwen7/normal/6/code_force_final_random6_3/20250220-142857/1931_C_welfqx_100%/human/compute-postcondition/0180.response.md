Output State: **`j` is `n-2`, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of `num`, `ck` is 1**.

The code snippet `f = 1` does not change the value of `f`. It simply reassigns `f` to the integer value 1, which was its original value according to the initial state. Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged.
