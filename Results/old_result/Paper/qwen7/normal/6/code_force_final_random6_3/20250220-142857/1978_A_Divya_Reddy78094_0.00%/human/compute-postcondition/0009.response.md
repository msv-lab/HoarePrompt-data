Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is the number of iterations already completed, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order after sorting**.

Explanation: The code `nums.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `nums` in descending order. The variables `n` and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` is still an input integer, `t` is the number of iterations already completed, and `nums` is updated to a new list of integers sorted in descending order.
