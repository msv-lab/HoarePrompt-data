Based on the initial state provided, after the loop completes all its iterations:

- `i` will be `-1`.
- `pergunta` will be the minimum value it has taken during all iterations, starting from its initial value and updating whenever `x + a[i]` is smaller.
- `x` will be the cumulative sum of the smaller cost between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each `i` from `n-1` down to `m`.

The print statement `print(pergunta)` will output the minimum value of `x + a[i]` encountered during the loop.

Output: **pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum value of x + a[i] encountered during the loop)**
