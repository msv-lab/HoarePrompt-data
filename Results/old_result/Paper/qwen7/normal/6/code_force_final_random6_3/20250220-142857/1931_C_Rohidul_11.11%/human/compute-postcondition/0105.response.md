Output State: `l` is equal to `r - k`, `r` is `n - k - 1`, `st` is the total number of consecutive duplicates found, `end` is `k`, and `ans` is the length of list `a` minus 1 if `a[0] == a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `l` will be equal to `r - k` where `k` is the number of times the loop has executed. This is because `l` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, and `r` is decremented by 1 with each iteration of the loop. The variable `st` remains unchanged from its final value after the last iteration, which is the total number of consecutive duplicates found. The variable `end` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, so after `k` iterations, it will be `k`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged from its initial or previous state, being the length of list `a` minus 1 if `a[0] == a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is 0.
