Output State: **`a` is infinity, `b` is the last element of the list `l`, `c` is either 2 or 1, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `x` is `n-1`**.

This means that `b` has been updated to the last element of the list `l` (since `x` is `n-1` and `l[x]` refers to the last element of the list). All other variables (`a`, `c`, `l`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
