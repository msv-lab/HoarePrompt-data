Output State: **`d` is `n-3`, `v` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, and `u` is the return value of `func_1(d)`**.

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used within a loop context (which is not explicitly shown here) and its effect is to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no further operations are specified after the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their pre-loop states. Specifically, `v` is reassigned to the return value of `func_1(d)`, and `u` retains the value returned by `func_1(d)`. The initial state of `d` remains `n-3`.
