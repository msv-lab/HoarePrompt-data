Output State: All monsters in the `monsters` list have been processed, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all processed monsters, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the last processed monster, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health` of the last processed monster, `can_survive` remains True unless the condition `total_bullets_needed > distance * k` was met for any monster, which would set `can_survive` to False.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all iterations, `bullets_used` will be the total health of all monsters, `distance` will be the absolute position of the last monster, `total_bullets_needed` will be the sum of `bullets_used` and the health of the last monster, and `can_survive` will be True unless the bullet requirement for any monster exceeded its positional limit.
