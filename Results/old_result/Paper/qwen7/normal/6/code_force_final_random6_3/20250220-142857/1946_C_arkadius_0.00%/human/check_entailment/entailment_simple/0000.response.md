### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation and Construction**:
   - The `Tree` class correctly represents a tree using adjacency lists and supports adding edges and finding the subtree sizes.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method correctly computes the subtree sizes and builds the tree structure.

2. **Component Analysis Functions**:
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are recursive functions that traverse the tree to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.
   - Both functions correctly update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of the tree nodes.

3. **Binary Search for Maximum Component Size**:
   - `func_3` uses binary search to find the maximum size `x` such that it's possible to remove `k` edges and ensure each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - The logic in `func_3` is correct. It checks if the number of good components is greater than or equal to `k` and if the remaining size is at least `x`.

4. **Main Function Execution**:
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the conditions.
   - `func_5` reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to get the result, printing the output.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the required functionality. There are no apparent logical errors or inconsistencies in the provided code.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: **True**
