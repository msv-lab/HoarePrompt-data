Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(10, n + 1):` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently 11.
   - `n` must be greater than 11 for the loop to continue.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `10` to `n + 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 11, the loop will continue if `n` is greater than 11.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 12.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 12 (since `i` will now be 12).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to 12.
- `n` must remain greater than 12.

Therefore, the updated state is:
State: **`total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `i` is 12, `word` is '11', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 1, `sum_total` is 1, `values[11]` is 1, `sum_values[11]` is 1.**
