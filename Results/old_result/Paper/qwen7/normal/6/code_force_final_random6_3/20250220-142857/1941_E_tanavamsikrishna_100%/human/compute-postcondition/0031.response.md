Output State: `i` is `d-1`, `d` must be greater than 1, `len(row)` must be greater than `d-1`, and `min_heap` must contain a tuple where the second element is `-d-2` or less.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as the second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. Given that the loop has executed three times, the second element of the tuple in `min_heap` must now be `-3` or less. Since the loop condition does not change with each iteration other than decrementing `i` by 1, after `n` iterations, the second element of the tuple will be `-n - 2`. Therefore, after all iterations, the second element of the tuple in `min_heap` will be `-d-2` or less.
