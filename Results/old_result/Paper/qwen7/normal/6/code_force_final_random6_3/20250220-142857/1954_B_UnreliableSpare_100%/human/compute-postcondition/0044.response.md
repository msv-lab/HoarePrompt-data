Output State: **`flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `0`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr` after updating it with `min(ans, cnt)`, and `cnt` is `0`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` with the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is initially `0`, `ans` remains unchanged. All other variables (`flag`, `t`, `n`, `i`, and `arr`) are not affected by this line of code.
