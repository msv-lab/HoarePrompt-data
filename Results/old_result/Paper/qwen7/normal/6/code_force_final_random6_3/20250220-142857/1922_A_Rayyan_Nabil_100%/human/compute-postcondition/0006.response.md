Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string of length `n`, `b` is an input string of length `n`, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 1, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

In this step, the code takes an input string, strips it of any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `c`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
