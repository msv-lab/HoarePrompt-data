Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `steps` is 1; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is the first integer entered; `d` is the second integer entered; `e` is the first integer from the input split; `f` is the second integer from the input split; `g` is the first integer from the input split converted to an integer; `h` is the second integer from the input split converted to an integer; `n` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`**.

This means that `n` is calculated as the sum of the squares of the differences between `a` and `e`, and `b` and `f`. All other variables retain their initial or previously described states.
