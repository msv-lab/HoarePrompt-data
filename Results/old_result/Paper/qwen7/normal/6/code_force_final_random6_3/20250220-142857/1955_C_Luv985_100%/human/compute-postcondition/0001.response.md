Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `T` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `T`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the only new variable `T` is assigned the value of the input integer, while the rest of the initial conditions remain valid.
