### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `q` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
4. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
5. **Default Case**: If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'NONE'.

However, there is a subtle issue with the peak condition check. The condition `a < b > c` should be `a < b and b > c` to ensure that both conditions are satisfied simultaneously. The current implementation uses the chained comparison `a < b > c`, which is equivalent to `(a < b) and (b > c)` in Python, but the parentheses are not explicitly shown. This means the condition is logically correct, but the original assessment did not clearly highlight this point.

To ensure clarity and correctness, let's re-evaluate the conditions:

- **Stair Condition**: `a < b < c` is correctly implemented.
- **Peak Condition**: `a < b and b > c` should be used instead of `a < b > c` for clarity, although the current implementation is logically correct.

Given that the conditions are logically correct and the program processes the inputs as specified, the program should work as intended.

### Correctness:
**True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description.
