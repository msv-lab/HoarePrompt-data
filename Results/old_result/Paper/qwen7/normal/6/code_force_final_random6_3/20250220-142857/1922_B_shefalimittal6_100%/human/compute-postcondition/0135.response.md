Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`, and `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` to its current value. Given that `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, the new value of `ans` is the sum of the previously added value (`cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`) and the newly added value (`v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`). The values of `i`, `n`, and `v[i]` remain unchanged.
