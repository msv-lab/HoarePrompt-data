Postcondition: `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `l` is increased by 1, `r` is decreased by 1, and `l` < `r`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `k` is further decreased by `2 * mi`, `a[l]` is further adjusted to `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is set to 0, `ans` is incremented by 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and 0, `l` is increased by 1, and `r` is decreased by 1.
