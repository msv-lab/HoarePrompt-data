Based on the initial state, `numbers` is a list with at least one more element, but no specific values or additional details about the list are provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `sum_values` or the specific index `n`.

Given this information, the print statement `print(sum_values[n])` will attempt to print the value at the index `n` of the `sum_values` list. Since the exact values of `sum_values` and `n` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **sum_values[n]**
