Output State: `arr` is a list containing [1, 4, 8], `i` is 9, `c` is `n`, `ans` is a list with the value `k0 - sum(ans) + 1 << i` and `[0] * (n - len(ans))` appended, `k0` is `k`, `n` is an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, `k` (the second element of `l1`) is 1 after all iterations, and `k` is 0 since it has been right-shifted until it becomes 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `k` is non-zero. After each iteration, `i` increments by 1, and `k` is right-shifted by 1 bit (`k = k >> 1`). The variable `arr` appends the value of `i` when `k & 1 == 1` (i.e., when the least significant bit of `k` is 1). Given that `k` starts as a non-zero integer and is right-shifted until it becomes 0, the loop will execute `log2(k)` times. If `k` was initially 15 (binary 1111), the loop would execute 4 times, appending 1, 4, 8, and 16 to `arr`. However, based on the given states, we can infer that `k` was initially a power of 2 minus 1, so after 3 iterations, `k` became 2 (binary 10), and after the fourth iteration, `k` became 1 (binary 1), and finally 0 (binary 0). Therefore, `arr` contains the values [1, 4, 8], and `i` is 9 since it increments by 1 each iteration.
