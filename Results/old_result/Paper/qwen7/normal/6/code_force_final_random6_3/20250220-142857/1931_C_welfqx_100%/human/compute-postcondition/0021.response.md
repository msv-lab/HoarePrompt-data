Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `r` is 0, `f` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether any two consecutive elements in the list `num` are different, `num` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `j` is `n - 2` (since the loop runs `n-1` times and breaks if it finds non-equal consecutive elements), and `n` remains unchanged.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `f` will be 0 if any two consecutive elements in the list `num` are different, and 1 otherwise. The variable `j` will be `n - 2` because the loop runs `n - 1` times. All other variables (`t`, `r`, `num`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
