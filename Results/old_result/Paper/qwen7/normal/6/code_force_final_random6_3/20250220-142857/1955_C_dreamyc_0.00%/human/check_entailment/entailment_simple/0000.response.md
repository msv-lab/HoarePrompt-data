Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Deque Usage**: The use of `deque` is appropriate for efficiently removing elements from both ends of the list, which is necessary for the alternating attack pattern described.

3. **Loop Logic**: The loop logic correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks:
   - It alternates between attacking the first and last ship.
   - It reduces the durability of the ships by the minimum of their current values.
   - It handles the case where a ship's durability reaches zero by removing it from further consideration.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The loop terminates correctly when `k` is exhausted or when there are fewer than two ships left.
   - The final check ensures that if the last remaining ship is still under attack (`k > 0` and only one ship remains), it is counted as sunk.

5. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the number of ships sunk after all attacks are performed.

Given the above points, the program logic matches the problem description and correctly simulates the scenario of the Kraken's attacks on the ships.

Correctness: **True**
