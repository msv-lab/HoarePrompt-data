Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the integer \( y \) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. Instead, it simply prints \( x - 1 \) for each test case, which does not guarantee the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

For example, consider the input \( x = 10 \). The program outputs \( y = 9 \), but the correct \( y \) should be \( 5 \) because \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7\), which is greater than \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\).

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
