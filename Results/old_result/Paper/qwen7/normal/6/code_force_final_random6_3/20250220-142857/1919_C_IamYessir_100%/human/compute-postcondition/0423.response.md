Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers.
   - `a` and `b` are lists whose states depend on the value of `lit[i]` relative to `x` and `y`.
   - `cp` remains 0.
   - `x` is greater than `y` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity.
   - If `x` is equal to `y`, then `x` remains equal to `y`.
   - Otherwise, if `x` is greater than or equal to an element in `lit`, `a` has one additional element and `b` remains unchanged.
   - If `x` is less than an element in `lit`, `a` may have one more element depending on the relationship between `y`, `lit[i]`, and `x`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must remain the same.

5. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition `n > 0` still holds true unless `n` is explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `n` remains the same.
   - The other variables (`lit`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, `x`, `y`) do not change based on the loop head alone and their values depend on the loop body, which is omitted here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` and `b` are lists whose states depend on the value of `lit[i+1]` relative to `x` and `y`, `cp` remains 0, `x` is greater than `y` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, if `x` is equal to `y`, then `x` remains equal to `y`, otherwise, if `x` is greater than or equal to an element in `lit`, `a` has one additional element and `b` remains unchanged, if `x` is less than an element in `lit`, `a` may have one more element depending on the relationship between `y`, `lit[i+1]`, and `x`.**
