### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - This is a correct implementation and is used to ensure the final result fits within the required modulo constraint.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function aims to find the maximum sum segment in the array.
   - However, it only finds the maximum sum segment once and does not handle the insertion of sums into the array.
   - The function does not consider the possibility of inserting multiple sums in different positions to maximize the final array sum.
   - The logic inside the function is flawed because it does not properly handle the dynamic nature of the problem where we can insert the sum of any subarray at any position.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function is completely empty and does not perform any operations related to the problem.
   - It sets `answer` to 0 but does not use the results from `func_2` or any other part of the program to compute the final result.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Problem Description:** The task is to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
- **Function `func_2`:** This function only finds the maximum sum subarray but does not simulate the insertion of sums. It fails to consider the dynamic nature of the problem where we can insert multiple sums in different positions.
- **Function `func_3`:** This function is completely empty and does not contribute to solving the problem.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions `func_2` and `func_3` are not designed to handle the problem's requirements, and `func_1` is only used for the modulo operation.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

**Final: False**
