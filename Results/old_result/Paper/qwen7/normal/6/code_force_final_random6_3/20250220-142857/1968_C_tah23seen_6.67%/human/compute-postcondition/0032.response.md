The loop condition is `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition must be true at the start of the next iteration.

Given the current state:
- `i` is 8
- `ans[9]` is equal to `ans[8] + ans[8]`

We need to ensure that `ans[9]` is still less than or equal to `arr[9]` for the loop to continue.

Since the loop condition depends on `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i + 1]`, and we know `i` is 8, the relevant values are `ans[9]` and `arr[9]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ans[9]` is already set to `ans[8] + ans[8]`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `arr[9]` is greater than or equal to `ans[9]` for the loop to continue.

So, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `arr[9]` is greater than or equal to `ans[9]`.

State: **`i` is 8; `ans[9]` is `ans[8] + ans[8]` and `arr[9]` must be greater than or equal to `ans[9]`**
