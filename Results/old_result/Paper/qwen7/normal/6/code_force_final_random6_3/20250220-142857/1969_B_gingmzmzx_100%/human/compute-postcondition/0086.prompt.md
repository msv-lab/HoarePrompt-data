Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cnt` is `[0, 0]`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the updated list `s`, `ans` is 0, `s` is updated to be the list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().strip())`, and `n` is `n-1`.
Code of the loop:
for c in s:
    cnt[c] += 1
    if c == 0:
        ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
    else:
        ans += zeroes - cnt[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty list of integers; `cnt[0]` and `cnt[c]` are incremented by 1; `ans` is equal to 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is 0, or `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]` where `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in the list `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty list of integers; `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1; `ans` is equal to 2 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is 1, or `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]` where `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in the list `s`, and `ans` is also incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]` if `c` is not 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty list of integers, `cnt[0]` and `cnt[1]` are incremented by 1 for the next elements `0` and `1` in `s`, respectively. `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0, otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding the difference between the number of zeroes in `s` and the new value of `cnt[0]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
