Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input split, `a[1]` will be printed, `a[2]` will be printed, `a[3]` will be printed, followed by a space, `i` is now set to `a[3]`, `res` is an empty list, `re` is still 2, and the upper limit `ul` is not equal to the lower limit `ur`.**

Explanation: The code `a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The values of `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` are now integers, and `i` is set to the value of `a[3]`. The other variables (`res`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`) remain unchanged. The initial print statements for `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` followed by a space are still part of the precondition and are preserved in the output state.
