Output State: **`flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the minimum value between its current value (which is undefined in the initial state) and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. Since `ans` was initially undefined in the given state, it will take the value of `cnt` after this operation. All other variables (`flag`, `t`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged.
