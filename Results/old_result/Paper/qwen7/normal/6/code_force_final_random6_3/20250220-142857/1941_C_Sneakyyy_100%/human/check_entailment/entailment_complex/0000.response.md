Reasoning:

The annotated program correctly describes the behavior of the provided function. Let's break down the logic and verify it against the problem statement:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Substring Search**:
   - The function uses a while loop to iterate through the string `s` with a window size of 3 characters.
   - It checks if the current substring of length 3 is either 'map' or 'pie'.
   - If the substring matches, it increments the counter `ans` and skips the next two characters (`i += 3`).
   - If the substring does not match, it simply moves to the next character (`i += 1`).

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all possible substrings of length 3, the function prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the function correctly identifies the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful by checking for the substrings 'map' and 'pie'. The logic ensures that the function processes each substring of length 3 exactly once and counts the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie'.

Therefore, the function is correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
