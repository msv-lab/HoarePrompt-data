Postcondition: `fnd` is either `fnd` + 1 or `fnd` (if `tot` is less than `k`), `tot` is the sum of the values in `D.values()`, `C[in_aa]` is either equal to `C[in_aa] + 1` or greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is either not decreased by 1 or is decreased by 2, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the corresponding element in `aa[:n - m]`, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is not decreased by 1.
