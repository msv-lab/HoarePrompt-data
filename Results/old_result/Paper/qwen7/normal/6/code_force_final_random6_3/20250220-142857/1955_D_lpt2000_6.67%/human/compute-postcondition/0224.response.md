Output State: **`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`; `out_aa` is either decremented by 1 in `aa[:n - m]` (if the if condition is true) or `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1 (if the else condition is true); `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1.**

This output state reflects that the value of `E[in_aa]` has been incremented by 1, while the conditions related to `fnd`, `in_aa`, and `out_aa` remain as described in the initial postcondition.
