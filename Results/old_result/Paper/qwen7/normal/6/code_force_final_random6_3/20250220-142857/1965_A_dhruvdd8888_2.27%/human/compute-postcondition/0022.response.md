Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the condition `range(len(nums) - 2)`. This means the loop will iterate over the indices from `0` to `len(nums) - 3`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cd` is 1 (indicating the condition was met in the previous iteration)
   - `i` is 0 (the current index in the loop)

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be within the valid range specified by the loop head (`0` to `len(nums) - 3`).

4. **Check the Validity of the Next Index**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the next value of `i` would be 1.
   - The condition `i < len(nums) - 2` must hold true for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `cd` will be set to 0 because the condition `nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1` needs to be checked again in the next iteration.

6. **Final State**:
   - `cd` is 0
   - `i` is 1

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`cd` is 0, `i` is 1**
