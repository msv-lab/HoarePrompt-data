Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by `2 * mi`, where `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
