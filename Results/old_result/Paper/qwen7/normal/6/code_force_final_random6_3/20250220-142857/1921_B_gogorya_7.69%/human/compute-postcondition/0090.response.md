Postcondition: `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - 1`, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2)`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `i` is less than `n`, and if `hd` is currently greater than 0, then `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1`. The current value of `s1[i]` is '1' and the current value of `s2[i]` is '0'.
