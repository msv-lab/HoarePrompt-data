Based on the initial state, `n` is an input integer, and `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. Since `nums` is sorted in descending order, the first element (`nums[0]`) is the largest integer in the list, and the second element (`nums[1]`) is the second largest integer in the list.

When the code snippet `print(nums[0] + nums[1])` is executed, it will add the largest integer in the list to the second largest integer in the list and print the result.

Output: **largest_integer + second_largest_integer (where largest_integer is the first element of nums and second_largest_integer is the second element of nums)**
