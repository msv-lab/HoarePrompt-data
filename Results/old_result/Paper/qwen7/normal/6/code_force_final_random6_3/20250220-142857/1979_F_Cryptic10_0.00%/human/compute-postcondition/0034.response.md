Postcondition: `v` is equal to `d - 3`, `u` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path` now includes `v` as its last element but `v` has been removed from `remaining_vertices`, and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged. This is because if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is added to `path`, removed from `remaining_vertices`, and the loops or if statements are exited. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, no changes occur.
