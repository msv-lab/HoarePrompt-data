Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer value converted from the first word of the input split, `b` is the second word from the input split converted to an integer, `t` is `b * 2`.**

Explanation: The code `t = b * 2` assigns the value of `b * 2` to the variable `t`. All other variables (`t1`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
