Output State: **`i` is 1, `ans[1]` is 1, `x` is `left[1] - a[1] - 1`, `inx2` is `last[0]`, `inx` is `last[0]`**.

Explanation: The line `inx = inx2` assigns the value of `inx2` to `inx`. Since the initial value of `inx2` is `last[0]`, `inx` is updated to `last[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
