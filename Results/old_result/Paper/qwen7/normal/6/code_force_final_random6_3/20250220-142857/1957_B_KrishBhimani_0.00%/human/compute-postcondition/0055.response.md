Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `arr` is a list containing at least one element. Let's denote the last element of `arr` as `i`.
   - `c` is equal to `n` + 2. Since `n` is not explicitly defined, we'll keep it as `n + 2`.
   - `ans` is a list that starts with specific elements: 1, 1, 2, 16, and continues with each subsequent element being 2 raised to the power of the corresponding index in `arr`, ending with `2^i`. Additionally, `ans` is extended by `0` for each missing element to match the length of `n`.

2. **Constructing `ans`**:
   - The list `ans` starts with the fixed elements: `[1, 1, 2, 16]`.
   - For each element in `arr`, the next element in `ans` is `2` raised to the power of the index of that element in `arr`.
   - The final element in `ans` is `2^i`, where `i` is the last element of `arr`.

3. **Extending `ans`**:
   - If the length of `ans` is less than `n`, it is extended by `0` to match the length of `n`.

Given this, let's assume `arr = [a1, a2, ..., ai]` where `ai` is the last element. The list `ans` will look like this:
- Start with `[1, 1, 2, 16]`.
- For each element in `arr` (excluding the first three), add `2` raised to the power of its index.
- The final element is `2^i`.

For example, if `arr = [1, 2, 3]`:
- The list `ans` would start with `[1, 1, 2, 16]`.
- Add `2^1` (which is 2) for the second element in `arr`, so now `ans = [1, 1, 2, 16, 2]`.
- Add `2^2` (which is 4) for the third element in `arr`, so now `ans = [1, 1, 2, 16, 2, 4]`.
- The final element is `2^3` (which is 8), so `ans = [1, 1, 2, 16, 2, 4, 8]`.

If `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]`:
- The list `ans` would start with `[1, 1, 2, 16]`.
- Add `2^1` (which is 2) for the second element in `arr`, so now `ans = [1, 1, 2, 16, 2]`.
- Add `2^2` (which is 4) for the third element in `arr`, so now `ans = [1, 1, 2, 16, 2, 4]`.
- Add `2^3` (which is 8) for the fourth element in `arr`, so now `ans = [1, 1, 2, 16, 2, 4, 8]`.
- The final element is `2^4` (which is 16), so `ans = [1, 1, 2, 16, 2, 4, 8, 16]`.

In general, the list `ans` will be `[1, 1, 2, 16, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^(i-1), 2^i]`.

Given the code snippet:
```python
print(*ans)
```

This will print the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

Output: **1 1 2 16 2^1 2^2 ... 2^(i-1) 2^i**
