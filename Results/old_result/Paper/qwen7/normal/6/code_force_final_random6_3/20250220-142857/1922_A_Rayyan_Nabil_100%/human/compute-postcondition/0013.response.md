Output State: **`n` is the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the input string after stripping, `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended, `_` is 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` to the `results` list. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `results`, and `_` are updated accordingly. The output state includes the updated `results` list and the unchanged values of the other variables.
