Output State: **`path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` must not be empty, `d` is `n-1`, `v` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`**.

Explanation: The code `v, u = func_1(d)` calls the function `func_1` with the argument `d`, which is `n-1`. The function returns two values, which are assigned to `v` and `u`. The initial values of `path`, `remaining_vertices`, and `d` remain unchanged, but now `v` and `u` have the values returned by `func_1(d)`.
