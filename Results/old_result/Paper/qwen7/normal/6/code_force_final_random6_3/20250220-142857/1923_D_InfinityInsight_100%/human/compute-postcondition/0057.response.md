Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `x` is left[3] - a[3] - 1, `inx` is the return value of `func_1(left, x)`**.

Explanation: The code `inx = func_1(left, x)` assigns the return value of `func_1(left, x)` to the variable `inx`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 2 and the definition of `x` as `left[3] - a[3] - 1` are still valid.
