### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the array `a` and the string `s`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes variables `l`, `k`, `q1`, and `q2`.
   - The variable `l` is set to the count of 'L' commands in the string `s`.
   - `k` is initialized to the product of the first `l-1` elements of `a` modulo `m` if the last command is 'L', or the `l`-th element modulo `m` if the last command is 'R'.
   - `q1` and `q2` are initialized to help track the indices for the product calculation.

3. **Result Array Initialization:**
   - An array `y` of size `n` is initialized with zeros.
   - The last element of `y` is set to `k`.

4. **Product Calculation Loop:**
   - The loop iterates backward through the array `a` from the second last element to the first.
   - If the current command is 'R', it updates `k` by multiplying it with the next element in `a` modulo `m` and increments `q2`.
   - If the current command is 'L', it updates `k` by multiplying it with the previous element in `a` modulo `m` and decrements `q1`.
   - The updated `k` is stored in the corresponding position in `y`.

5. **Output:**
   - The result array `y` is printed.

### Correctness Check

1. **Handling of 'L' and 'R':**
   - The logic for handling 'L' and 'R' commands is correct. It correctly updates the product and adjusts the indices `q1` and `q2` accordingly.

2. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation is performed correctly at each step to ensure the product remains within the bounds of `m`.

3. **Order of Operations:**
   - The program processes the commands in the order they appear in the string `s`, which is correct according to the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the last command is 'L' or 'R' correctly by setting `k` appropriately.

5. **Index Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the indices `q1` and `q2` to ensure they do not go out of bounds. This is crucial because the array `a` is modified dynamically during the execution of the commands.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the program, it appears that the logic is correct and matches the problem description. The program correctly processes the commands and computes the required remainders.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
