Reasoning:
- The problem requires Alice to divide the books into two piles and maximize the sum of the highest-numbered book in each pile.
- The provided solution sorts the list of book pages in descending order and then prints the sum of the first two elements. This approach is flawed because it always pairs the largest book with the second-largest book, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of the highest-numbered book in each pile.
- For example, consider the input: `4 2 3 3 1`. Sorting this list gives `[3, 3, 2, 1]`. The solution would pair `3` and `3`, resulting in a sum of `6`. However, the optimal solution would be to pair `3` (first pile) and `4` (second pile), resulting in a sum of `7`.
- Therefore, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
