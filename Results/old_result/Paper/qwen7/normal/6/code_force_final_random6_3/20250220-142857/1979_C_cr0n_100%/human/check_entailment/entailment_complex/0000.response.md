### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to distribute coins across \(n\) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - Each outcome \(i\) has a multiplier \(k_i\), and we need to find non-negative integers \(x_i\) (bet amounts) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: Computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers \(a\) and \(b\).
     - Correctness: This function correctly computes the LCM using the formula \(\text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}\).
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: Processes the input to determine the bet distribution.
     - **Initial Input**: Reads \(N\) and a list of multipliers \(k_i\).
     - **Cumulative LCM Calculation**: Uses `func_1` to compute the cumulative LCM of all multipliers.
     - **Bet Distribution Calculation**: Computes a list `vprod` where each element is \(\frac{\text{cumulative LCM}}{k_i}\).
     - **Validation**: Checks if the remaining value `den` (initial cumulative LCM minus the sum of `vprod`) is positive. If not, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the bet distribution.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Cumulative LCM Calculation**: The cumulative LCM calculation ensures that the total bet amount is minimized while satisfying the condition.
   - **Bet Distribution Validation**: The check `if (den <= 0)` ensures that the total bet amount is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - **Output**: The function correctly handles both valid and invalid cases by printing either the bet distribution or `-1`.

Given the problem constraints and the functions' implementations, the provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
