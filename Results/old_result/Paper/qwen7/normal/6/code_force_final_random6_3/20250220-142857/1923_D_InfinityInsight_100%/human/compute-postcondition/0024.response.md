Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is a non-empty list, `last` is an appropriately initialized list, `left` is a list with its last element updated to `left[-1] + 0` which is equal to `left[-1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends to the list `left` the value of its last element plus `i`. Given that `i` is 0, the new element appended to `left` is simply the last element of `left` itself. The values of `i`, `a`, and `last` remain unchanged.
