Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `ldb` remains unchanged, `sng` has the element `lft[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `sng`. Since `i` is already set to `i + 1`, it does not get modified again. The condition that `n` is greater than 1 remains unchanged, and `ldb` remains as it was previously.
