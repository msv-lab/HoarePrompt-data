Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in ldb`. The variables involved here are `elem` and `ldb`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in `ldb`. Inside the loop, there is a condition based on `k - sz` that either increments `sz` by 2 and breaks the loop or does nothing if `k - sz` is less than 2.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `elem` is the second element of `ldb`.
   - `i` is 1 (though `i` is not directly used in the loop, it might be part of the context).
   - If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is incremented by 2 and the loop breaks.
   - If `k - sz` is less than 2, no changes are made to `sz`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `elem` is the second element of `ldb`, the next element in `ldb` will be the third element.
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not used in the loop itself but might be part of the context.
   - The condition `k - sz` is not directly affected by the loop iteration itself, so its value remains the same unless explicitly changed inside the loop body.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `elem` will now be the third element of `ldb`.
   - `i` remains 1.
   - The condition `k - sz` remains the same unless modified within the loop body, but since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, we do not change `k - sz`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`elem` is the third element of `ldb`, `i` is 1**
