Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `x` and the range `range(n)`. Therefore, the variables involved are `x` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values**:
   - `a` is set to infinity.
   - `b` is set to infinity.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `x` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - `c` is 0.
   - `l` is a list of integers entered by the user.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `x` is less than `n`. The loop will start with `x = n-1` and increment `x` by 1 in each iteration until `x` equals `n`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `x` starts at `n-1`, it needs to be adjusted to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `x` must be less than `n` at the start of the loop. This means `n` should be greater than 0 (since if `n` is 0 or negative, `x` would never be less than `n`).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `x` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`a` is set to infinity, `b` is set to infinity, `c` is 0, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `x` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
