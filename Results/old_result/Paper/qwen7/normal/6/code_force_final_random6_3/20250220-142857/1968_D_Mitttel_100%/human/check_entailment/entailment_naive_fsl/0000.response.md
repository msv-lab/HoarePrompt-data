Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game" as described. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not account for the possibility of moving to `p_s` and `p_pb` during each turn. Instead, it only considers staying at the current position or moving to `p_s` or `p_pb` once per turn, which does not accurately reflect the rules of the game.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

Expected output:
```
Bodya
```

However, the provided program will incorrectly calculate the scores and determine the result. The correct implementation should consider all possible moves for each player in each turn, including the option to stay at the current position or move to the next position in the permutation.
