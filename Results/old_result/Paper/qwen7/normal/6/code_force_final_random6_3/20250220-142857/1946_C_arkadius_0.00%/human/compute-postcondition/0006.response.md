Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an integer obtained from input, an edge is added between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the tree, `[u, v]` is a list containing integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the list `[u, v]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 2 is still valid. Additionally, an edge is added between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the tree, and the variables `u` and `v` now hold the specific integer values obtained from the input.
