#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9. Additionally, there are two lists of integers: a list of length n containing integers a_i such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and another list of length n containing integers x_i such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        
        bullets_used = 0
        
        can_survive = True
        
        for pos, health in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
            if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            bullets_used += health
        
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `can_survive` remains True, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all monsters, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health` of the last processed monster, `t` is 0, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is an empty list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the last processed monster, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
    #
    #After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be 0 because all input cases have been processed. The `monsters` list will be empty since all tuples have been processed. The `can_survive` variable will remain `True` unless the condition `total_bullets_needed > distance * k` was met for any monster during the iterations, which would have set `can_survive` to `False`. `bullets_used` will be the sum of the health values of all monsters, and `distance` will be the absolute value of the position of the last processed monster. The lists `x` and `a` will retain their initial states since they are not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t, a list of n integers a, a list of n integers x, and two integers n and k. For each test case, it determines whether a group of monsters, represented by the positions and health values from the lists x and a, can survive a series of attacks using k bullets per unit distance. If the total health of the monsters at any position exceeds the available bullets for that position, the monsters cannot survive, and the function outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, it outputs 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs 'YES' if all monsters can survive for all test cases, and 'NO' otherwise.
