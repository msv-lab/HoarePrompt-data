### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires rearranging the permutation with at most 2 swaps so that the element `x` is at position `l` when performing a binary search. The binary search algorithm is defined and the task is to ensure that `p[l] == x` after the rearrangement.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the target value `x`.
   - It then reads the permutation array.
   - The `func_1` function is supposed to perform the necessary swaps to ensure `p[l] == x`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function performs a binary search-like operation to find the position where `x` should be placed.
   - It then checks if the current position of `x` matches the desired position.
   - If they don't match, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped.
   - If they match, it prints `0`.

4. **Issues Identified**:
   - The binary search-like operation in `func_1` does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm. Specifically, the `l` and `r` variables are initialized incorrectly (`l = 0` and `r = n - 1` instead of `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`).
   - The logic inside the `while` loop also does not correctly handle the binary search conditions.
   - The function does not ensure that the permutation is rearranged with at most 2 swaps.
   - The function does not handle the case where the element `x` is not present in the permutation at all.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The binary search should start with `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`.
   - The middle index `m` should be calculated as `m = (l + r) // 2`.
   - The condition `if array[mid] <= x:` should be used to update `l` and `r`.
   - After finding the correct position, the function should check if `x` is already at the correct position. If not, it should find the correct position and perform the necessary swaps.
   - If `x` is not in the permutation, the function should identify the smallest and largest elements that can be swapped to bring `x` into the permutation.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the required functionality. The binary search is flawed, and the logic for handling the swaps is incomplete. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
