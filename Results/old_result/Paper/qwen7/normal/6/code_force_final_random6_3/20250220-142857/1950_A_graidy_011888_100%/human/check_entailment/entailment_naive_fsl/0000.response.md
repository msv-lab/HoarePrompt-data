Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal (i.e., `a == b == c`). According to the problem description, such a case should be classified as "NONE". However, the current implementation will incorrectly classify this case as either "STAIR" or "PEAK" depending on the order of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

For example, if the input is `0 0 0`, the program will output "STAIR" or "PEAK" instead of "NONE". This violates the problem description.
