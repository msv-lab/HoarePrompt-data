Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` will be `n-1` after the loop completes.
- `a` will be the minimum value found in the list `l`.
- `b` will be the second smallest value found in the list `l`.
- `c` will be the count of elements in `l` that are strictly greater than `b`.

The `print(c)` statement will print the value of `c`.

Output: **c (where c is the count of elements in l that are strictly greater than b)**
