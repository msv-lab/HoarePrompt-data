Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop is iterating over the `numbers` list using the variable `n`.
- The loop body is omitted.
- We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- No specific values or conditions for `n` or `numbers` are given, so we assume the general case where `n` is the current element being processed in the loop.

### Loop Head:
- The loop is defined as `for n in numbers:`.

### Analysis:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in the `numbers` list.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `n` would have taken the value of the current element in the `numbers` list.
- For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in the `numbers` list.

### Adjusting the States:
- Since `n` is the current element being processed, it does not need to be adjusted; it will take the next value from the `numbers` list.
- The `numbers` list itself needs to be adjusted to reflect that there is at least one more element left to process.

### Conclusion:
- The only state that needs to be adjusted is the `numbers` list, ensuring it has at least one more element.

### Final Answer:
State: **`numbers` must be a list with at least one more element**
