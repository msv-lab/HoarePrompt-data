Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the product of two numbers \( x \) and \( y \) by swapping their corresponding digits any number of times. The provided solution aims to achieve this by swapping digits in such a way that the smaller digit of each pair is moved to the other number and the larger digit remains in the original number.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1()` takes two strings `a` and `b` as input, which represent the numbers \( x \) and \( y \).
   - It then converts these strings into lists of characters.
   - The function iterates through the first half of the lists and swaps the digits such that the smaller digit goes to the other list and the larger digit stays in the original list.
   - For the second half, it reverses the logic, ensuring that the larger digit moves to the other list and the smaller digit stays in the original list.
   - Finally, it prints the modified lists as strings.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints ensure that both \( x \) and \( y \) consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
   - The function correctly handles the swapping logic as described in the problem statement.
   - The function processes the entire string length, including the middle character if the length is odd, ensuring all digits are considered.

4. **Output**:
   - The output is correct as it prints the modified \( x \) and \( y \) after the specified operations.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to maximize the product of \( x \) and \( y \) by swapping their digits as required.

Correctness: **True**
