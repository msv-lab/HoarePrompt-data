Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

The `print(2)` statement simply prints the integer 2. Since there is no dependency on the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, or `k` for this specific print statement, it will always print 2 regardless of the values of these other variables.

Output: **2**
