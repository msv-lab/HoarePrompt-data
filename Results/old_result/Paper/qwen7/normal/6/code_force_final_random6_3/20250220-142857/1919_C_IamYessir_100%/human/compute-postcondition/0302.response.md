Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` + 1 - 1, `n` must be at least 1, `x` is either set to infinity (float('inf')) or reassigned to the last element of list `a`, `y` is either unchanged (float('inf')) or set to the last element of list `b`, and `b` and `lit` are unchanged; `a` now has its last element appended with the element from `lit` at index `i-1`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element from the list `lit` at index `i-1` to the list `a`. Since `i` is equal to the length of list `b` + 1, `i-1` is equal to the length of list `b`. Therefore, the last element of `lit` is appended to `a`. The other variables and lists remain unchanged according to the initial state.
