Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` representing the number of yogurts to buy, the price of one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion, respectively.

2. **Logic for Calculating Minimum Cost:**
   - The program checks if the cost of buying two yogurts (`C`) is less than the cost of buying them individually (`2 * B`).
     - If `2 * B < C`, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. So, the total cost is `A * B`.
     - If `2 * B >= C`, it means it's cheaper to take advantage of the promotion.
       - It then checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even.
         - If `A` is even, the total cost is `A * C / 2` because you can buy all yogurts in pairs.
         - If `A` is odd, it buys as many pairs as possible and then buys the remaining yogurt(s) individually.
           - It calculates the number of pairs as `X = A // 2`.
           - The cost for these pairs is `X * C`.
           - The remaining yogurts are `A % 2`, and their cost is `A % 2 * B`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case.

### Verification with Examples:

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
- Input: `2 5 9`
- `A = 2`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
- Since `2 * B = 10 > C`, we use the promotion.
- `A` is even, so the cost is `2 * C / 2 = 9`.

#### Example 2:
- Input: `3 5 9`
- `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
- Since `2 * B = 10 > C`, we use the promotion.
- `A` is odd, so we buy 1 pair for `C` and 1 individual yogurt for `B`.
- Total cost is `1 * C + 1 * B = 9 + 5 = 14`.

#### Example 3:
- Input: `3 5 11`
- `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
- Since `2 * B = 10 < C`, we buy each yogurt individually.
- Total cost is `3 * B = 15`.

#### Example 4:
- Input: `4 5 11`
- `A = 4`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
- Since `2 * B = 10 < C`, we buy each yogurt individually.
- Total cost is `4 * B = 20`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
