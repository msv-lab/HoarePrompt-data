Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `s` is `c * (k * (k - 1) / 2) * c * m + k * c * a`, `c` is `n * (n - 1)`, `a` is the sum of all integers `f` provided as input over the course of the loop's execution, `u` is the last integer from the input, `v` is the second last integer from the input, `f` is the last integer from the input, `i` is `k`.**

Explanation: The loop runs `k` times, and in each iteration, the value of `s` is updated by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its current value. Since `c` remains constant throughout the loop, the final value of `s` is the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for all `i` from `0` to `k-1`. This results in the formula `c * (k * (k - 1) / 2) * c * m + k * c * a`. The values of `c`, `a`, `u`, `v`, and `f` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop. The variable `i` reaches `k` after the loop completes all its iterations.
