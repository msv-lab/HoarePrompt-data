test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) representing the size of the array and Polycarp's favorite integers, followed by a list of n integers representing the elements of the array (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). The length of each tuple is n + 2, and 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
