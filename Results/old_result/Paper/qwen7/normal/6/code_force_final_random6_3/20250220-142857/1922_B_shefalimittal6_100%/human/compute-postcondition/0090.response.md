Output State: **`cnt` is increased by `v[i + 1]`, `i` is in the range `[1, n + 1)`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`, if `v[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i + 1] * (v[i + 1] - 1) // 2 + v[i + 1] * (v[i + 1] - 1) * (v[i + 1] - 2) // 6`, if `v[i + 1]` is less than 3, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `ans` based on the current value of `cnt` and `v[i]`. It does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or `v[i + 1]` directly. The condition for updating `ans` when `v[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 3 is preserved, and the new condition for updating `ans` when `v[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 3 is added. The initial conditions for `cnt` and `ans` remain unchanged except for the new update rule applied to `ans`.
