Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of sale days), `m` (a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day), `k` (a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end), and `prices` (a list of `n` positive integers representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming `n` days). It returns the total cost to buy `k` tickets considering the price increases each day, with `pq` being an empty heap since all elements were processed, `tickets_bought` equaling `k` indicating all required tickets have been bought, and `price_increase` reflecting the total increment in ticket price throughout the process.**
