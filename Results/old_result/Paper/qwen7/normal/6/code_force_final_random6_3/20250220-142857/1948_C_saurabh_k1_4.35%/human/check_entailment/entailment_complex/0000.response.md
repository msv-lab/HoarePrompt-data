Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program only checks the last column of the second row (`b[n-2]`) to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n).
2. The program fails to consider the entire grid and the sequence of movements required to reach the target cell (2, n).
3. The logic should involve checking if there is a continuous path from the starting cell (1, 1) to the target cell (2, n) by following the arrows in both rows.

Given these issues, the annotated program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
