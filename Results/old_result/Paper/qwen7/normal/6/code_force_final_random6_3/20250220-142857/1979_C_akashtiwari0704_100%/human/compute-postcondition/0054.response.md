Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `g` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `sumo` remains unchanged, `T` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `prod` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input().**

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` by splitting the input string using spaces and converting each element to an integer. However, since the initial values of the other variables (`bets`, `g`, `i`, `l`, `sumo`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `prod`, `ans`) remain unchanged, they are included in the output state as they were before the code execution. The new list `a` is created based on the input provided by the user.
