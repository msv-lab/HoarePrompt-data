Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `result in results`. This means the loop variable is `result`, and it iterates over the elements of the `results` list.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - **`result`**: This is the loop variable that takes the value of each element in the `results` list during each iteration.
   - **`results`**: This is the list that contains the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration from 1 to `t`.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the `results` list.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is the length of the `results` list, meaning there were `t` elements in the list.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop variable `result` takes the value of each element in the `results` list, and the list `results` is being iterated over, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the current `result` value.
   - The list `results` itself does not change; it remains the same list with `t` elements.

5. **Update the State**:
   - After the previous iteration, `result` held the value of the last element in the `results` list.
   - For the next iteration, `result` will hold the value of the next element in the `results` list.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `result` now holds the value of the next element in the `results` list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is the length of the `results` list, `n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration from 1 to `t-1`, and `result` is the next element in the `results` list**.
