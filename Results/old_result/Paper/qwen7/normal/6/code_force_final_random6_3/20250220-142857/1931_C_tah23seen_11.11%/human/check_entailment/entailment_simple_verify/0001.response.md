### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to confirm the correctness of the assessment.

#### Input Handling:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
- It calls `func_1(arr)` and prints the result.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
- It starts by finding the first and last different elements in the array.
  - `i` is initialized to 0, and `j` is initialized to the last index of the array (`len(arr) - 1`).
  - It iterates through the array to find the first pair of different elements.
  - If all elements are the same (`i > j`), it returns 0.
- After identifying the first pair of different elements, it checks if all elements between `i` and `j` are the same.
  - If they are, it means the entire array can be made uniform by setting all elements between `i` and `j` to the value of `arr[i]` or `arr[j]`.
  - If they are not, it calculates the cost of making all elements between `i` and `j` equal to either `arr[i]` or `arr[j]`.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation:**
   - The function only considers the cost of setting all elements between `i` and `j` to either `arr[i]` or `arr[j]`.
   - However, the problem requires finding the minimum cost to make all elements equal, which might involve setting all elements to a different value that minimizes the cost.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled:**
   - The function does not handle cases where the array already has all elements equal.
   - It does not consider the possibility of setting all elements to a different value that minimizes the cost.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
Let's consider the example test case `[4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1, 3]`:
- The function identifies the first pair of different elements at indices 0 and 3.
- It calculates the cost of setting all elements between 0 and 3 to either 4 or 7.
- The cost is `3 - 0 + 1 = 4`, but this might not be the optimal solution.

To verify the correctness, let's consider another example:
- Consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`.
- The function identifies the first pair of different elements at indices 0 and 5.
- It calculates the cost of setting all elements between 0 and 5 to either 1 or 1, which is `5 - 0 + 1 = 6`.
- However, the optimal solution would be to set all elements to 1, which costs `5 - 0 + 1 = 6`.

Given these observations, the function indeed does not handle the general case correctly. It only considers the cost of setting elements to the values at the identified indices without considering other possible values that could minimize the cost.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not account for the possibility of setting all elements to a different value that minimizes the cost. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
