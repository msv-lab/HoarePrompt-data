Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `segments_variants` now contains `max_segment` plus the element `len(arr) - 1` and a new list containing `len(arr) - 1`; `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` remains the segment with the highest sum found throughout the entire iteration; `max_sum` remains -1; `total_max_segment` is [-1]
Code of the loop:
for segment in segments_variants:
    if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0] and len(segment) != 1:
        total_max_segment = segment


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `segments_variants` must contain at least one element; if `total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]` and the length of `segment` is not 1, then `total_max_segment` is updated to be equal to `segment`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `segments_variants` must contain at least one element. If `total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]` and `len(segment) != 1`, then `total_max_segment` is updated to `segment`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `segments_variants` must contain at least one element. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]` and `segment` has more than one element, then `total_max_segment` is updated to be equal to `segment`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
