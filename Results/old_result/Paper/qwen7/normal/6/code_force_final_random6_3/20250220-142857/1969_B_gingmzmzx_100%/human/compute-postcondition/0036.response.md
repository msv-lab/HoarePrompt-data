Output State: **`cnt` is [1, 0], `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `ans` is 0, `s` must contain at least one element, `c` is the first element of `s`**.

Explanation: The code `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count of the first element of the list `s` (denoted as `c`) in the list `cnt`. Initially, `cnt` is `[0, 0]`, meaning both elements are 0. Since `c` is the first element of `s`, `cnt[c]` (which is `cnt[0]` because `c` is the first element) is incremented by 1. Thus, `cnt` becomes `[1, 0]`. The other variables (`zeroes`, `ans`, `s`, and `c`) remain unchanged.
