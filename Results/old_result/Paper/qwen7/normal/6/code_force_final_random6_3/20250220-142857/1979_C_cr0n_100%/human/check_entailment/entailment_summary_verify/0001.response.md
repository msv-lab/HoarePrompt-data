### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the core logic of the program but misses a crucial edge case. Specifically, the program should handle cases where the total bet equals the winnings, which should result in `-1`. The provided function `func_2` does not account for this scenario, leading to an incorrect output in some cases.

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summary:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula \(\text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\gcd(a, b)}\).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Reading Input**: It reads the number of outcomes \(N\) and the multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\).
   - **Calculating LCM**: It initializes `den` with the first multiplier and iteratively calculates the LCM of `den` and each subsequent multiplier.
   - **Distributing Coins**: It computes the required bet amounts for each outcome by dividing `den` by each multiplier. It then subtracts the sum of these bet amounts from `den` to get the remaining value.
   - **Output**: If the remaining value is non-positive, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the bet amounts.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **LCM Calculation**:
   - The LCM calculation is correct and ensures that the bet amounts are distributed in a way that minimizes the total bet while ensuring the condition is met.

2. **Bet Distribution**:
   - The bet amounts are correctly calculated as `den // r` for each multiplier \(r\). These amounts ensure that the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the total bet is not strictly less than the winnings by checking if the remaining value after distributing the bets is non-positive. However, it does not handle the case where the total bet equals the winnings, which should also result in `-1`.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the example provided again with a focus on the edge case:

- **Test Case 1**: \( N = 3 \), multipliers \( [3, 2, 7] \)
  - LCM of \( 3, 2, 7 \) is \( 42 \).
  - Bet amounts: \( 42 // 3 = 14 \), \( 42 // 2 = 21 \), \( 42 // 7 = 6 \).
  - Total bet: \( 14 + 21 + 6 = 41 \).
  - Winnings: \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \), \( 2 \times 21 = 42 \), \( 7 \times 6 = 42 \).
  - Condition satisfied: \( 41 < 42 \).

- **Test Case 2**: \( N = 2 \), multipliers \( [3, 3] \)
  - LCM of \( 3, 3 \) is \( 3 \).
  - Bet amounts: \( 3 // 3 = 1 \), \( 3 // 3 = 1 \).
  - Total bet: \( 1 + 1 = 2 \).
  - Winnings: \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \), \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \).
  - Condition satisfied: \( 2 < 3 \).

- **Test Case 3**: \( N = 5 \), multipliers \( [5, 5, 5, 5, 5] \)
  - LCM of \( 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 \) is \( 5 \).
  - Bet amounts: \( 5 // 5 = 1 \), \( 5 // 5 = 1 \), \( 5 // 5 = 1 \), \( 5 // 5 = 1 \), \( 5 // 5 = 1 \).
  - Total bet: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 \).
  - Winnings: \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \), \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \), \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \), \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \), \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \).
  - Condition not satisfied: \( 5 \not< 5 \).

### Final Evaluation

The program should handle the case where the total bet equals the winnings, which should result in `-1`. The current implementation does not handle this case correctly, leading to an incorrect output in some scenarios.

### Final Answer

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the total bet equals the winnings, which should result in `-1`.
