Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `q` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, `c` is the third integer entered.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t` and `q` remain unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1 (though the increment is not explicitly shown, it is implied by the context). Since the initial value of `i` was 0, after this line, `i` would be 1, but since the question asks to include the unchanged state of `i`, it remains as 0.
