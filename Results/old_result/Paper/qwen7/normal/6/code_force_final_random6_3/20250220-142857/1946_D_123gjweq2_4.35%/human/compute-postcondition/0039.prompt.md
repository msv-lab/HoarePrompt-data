You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cur_arr is a list of integers representing a segment of the input array a, bit is an integer representing the current bit position being considered, and x is an integer representing the favorite number x from the problem description.
def find_max(cur_arr, bit):
    if (bit == -1) :
        return len(cur_arr)
        #The program returns the length of the list 'cur_arr'
    #State: cur_arr is a list of integers representing a segment of the input array a, bit is an integer representing the current bit position being considered, and x is an integer representing the favorite number x from the problem description. The value of bit is not equal to -1
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    thing1 = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
        
    #State: Postcondition: `cur_arr` must be empty, `xor` is the result of XORing all elements in the original `cur_arr`, and `new_arr` contains all the elements that satisfied the condition (i.e., their `bit`-th bit is 0) in the order they were encountered.
    if (xor >> bit & 1) :
        thing1 = -1
    else :
        thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)
    #State: Postcondition: `cur_arr` must be empty, `xor` is the result of XORing all elements in the original `cur_arr`, and `new_arr` contains either all the elements whose `bit`-th bit is 0 or all the elements whose `bit`-th bit is 1, in the order they were encountered. If the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 1, `new_arr` contains elements whose `bit`-th bit is 1, and `thing1` is the maximum element in `new_arr` based on the `bit`-th bit. If the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0, `new_arr` contains elements whose `bit`-th bit is 0, and `thing1` is -1.
    if (x >> bit & 1) :
        return max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))
        #The program returns the maximum value between the maximum element found in `new_arr` when considering the `(bit - 1)`-th bit and the length of `new_arr`.
    else :
        return thing1
        #The program returns `thing1`, which is the maximum element in `new_arr` if the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0, otherwise it returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `cur_arr`, a list of integers, and `bit`, an integer representing the current bit position. It returns the length of the list `cur_arr` if the second condition is not met. Otherwise, it returns either the maximum value between the maximum element found in `new_arr` when considering the `(bit - 1)`-th bit and the length of `new_arr`, or `thing1`, which is the maximum element in `new_arr` if the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0, otherwise it returns -1.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the length of the list 'cur_arr'

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value between the maximum element found in `new_arr` when considering the `(bit - 1)`-th bit and the length of `new_arr`.

Case_3: The program returns `thing1`, which is the maximum element in `new_arr` if the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0, otherwise it returns -1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
