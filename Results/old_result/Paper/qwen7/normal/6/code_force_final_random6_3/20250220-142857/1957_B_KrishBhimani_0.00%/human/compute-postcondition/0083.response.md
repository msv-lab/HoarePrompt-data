Output State: **`arr` is a list containing all the indices where `i` was incremented and `k & 1 == 1` was true, `i` is the final value of `i` which is `k0 + 1`, `c` is the new input value + 2, `ans` is an empty list, `n` is an integer obtained from splitting the last element of `l1` and converting it to an integer, `k` is 0, and `k0` is equal to the initial value of `k` before it became 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `ans`. Since no operations are performed on any of the variables, their states remain unchanged. The list `arr` retains its previous state, `i` remains as `k0 + 1`, `c` remains as the new input value + 2, `n` remains as the integer obtained from splitting the last element of `l1` and converting it to an integer, `k` remains as 0, and `k0` remains as the initial value of `k` before it became 0.
