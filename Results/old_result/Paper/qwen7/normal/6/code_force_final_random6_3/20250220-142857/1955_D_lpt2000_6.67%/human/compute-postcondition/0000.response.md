Output State: **`nabors` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `nabors` ≤ 10^4. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from the initial state.**

The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `nabors`. Since the input is an integer within the specified range, `nabors` now holds this value. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`) are not affected by this operation and retain their initial states.
