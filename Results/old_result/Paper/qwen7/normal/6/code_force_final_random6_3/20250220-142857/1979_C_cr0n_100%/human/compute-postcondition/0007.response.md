Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `x in vals`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `vals`.

2. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - **`vals`**: The state of `vals` (a list of integers) does not change within the loop itself unless explicitly modified inside the loop. Since no modifications to `vals` are mentioned, we assume `vals` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - **`x`**: The variable `x` is set to the next element in the list `vals` during each iteration of the loop. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be the next element in the list `vals`.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `vals` must have at least one element. This condition is already satisfied since it is given that `vals` must have at least one element.

Based on the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `vals` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `x` will be the next element in the list `vals`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`vals` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `x` is the next element in the list `vals`**.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`vals` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `x` is the next element in the list `vals`**.
