Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, x and y are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    k = abs(n - m)
    if k & k - 1 == 0:
        print(k)
    elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
        print(1)
    elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
        print(2)
    else:
        l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
        p = len(l)
        q = 2 ** (p - 1)
        print(k - q)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer input split from `t`, and `m` is the second integer input split from `t`; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, then `k` is a power of 2. Otherwise, either `n` is 0 and `m` is an odd number, or `k` is not a power of 2, and `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input split from `t`, `m` is the second integer input split from `t`, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1. If `k` is a power of 2, `k` remains unchanged. If `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, `k` remains unchanged. If `n` is 0 and `m` is even, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\). Otherwise, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `l`, `p`, and `q` remain as they were before the if-else block.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is 2. Otherwise, `l`, `p`, and `q` are not defined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
