Output State: **`bullets_used` is `health` more than its original value, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`, if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, then `can_survive` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `total_bullets_needed` is not greater than `distance * k`, then no changes are made to `can_survive`.**

This means that the value of `bullets_used` has been incremented by the value of `health`. The values of `distance`, `total_bullets_needed`, and `can_survive` remain as per their postconditions, unless `total_bullets_needed` exceeds `distance * k`, in which case `can_survive` is set to `False`.
