Output State: **`max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is [1, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `arr` is a non-empty list**

Explanation: The code updates `max_segment[0]` by adding the value of `arr[i]` to it. Initially, `max_segment[0]` is 0 (since `max_segment` is [0, 0]), and `i` is 1. After executing the line `max_segment[0] += arr[i]`, `max_segment[0]` becomes 1 (assuming `arr[1]` is 1). The value of `i` is incremented to 2 as a side effect of the operation. All other variables remain unchanged.
