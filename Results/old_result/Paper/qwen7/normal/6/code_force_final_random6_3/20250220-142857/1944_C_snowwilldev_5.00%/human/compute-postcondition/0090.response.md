Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `N` is the same, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1**

The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the value `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt`. The initial state shows that `i` is `i + 2`, `N` is the same, and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. After executing the code, `i` remains `i + 2`, `N` remains unchanged, and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.
