Output State: **`l` is equal to `r - k`, `r` is `n - k - 1`, `st` is the total number of consecutive duplicates found, `end` is `k`, and `ans` is `r - l - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated to the value of `r - l - 1`. Given the initial conditions, `l` is `r - k` and `r` is `n - k - 1`. Substituting these into the expression for `ans`, we get `ans = (n - k - 1) - (r - k) - 1`. Since `r = r`, the `- k` terms cancel out, leaving `ans = n - r - 2`. However, since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we keep it in terms of the known variables. The other variables (`st`, `end`) remain unchanged.
