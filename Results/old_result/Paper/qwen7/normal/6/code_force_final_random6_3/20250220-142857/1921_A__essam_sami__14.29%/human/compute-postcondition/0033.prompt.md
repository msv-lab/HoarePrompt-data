Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for steps in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    c, d = map(int, input().split())
    e, f = map(int, input().split())
    g, h = map(int, input().split())
    n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
    x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
    if x > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        print(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0; `steps` is 1; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is the first integer entered; `d` is the second integer entered; `e` is the first integer from the input split; `f` is the second integer from the input split; `g` is the first integer from the input split converted to an integer; `h` is the second integer from the input split converted to an integer; if `x > n`, then the current value of `x` remains unchanged and is still greater than `n`. Otherwise, the current value of `x` remains unchanged and is not greater than `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0 and `steps` is 2. If `x` is greater than `n`, then `x` remains unchanged and `n` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged and `n` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 3, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the third integer entered, `f` is the fourth integer entered, `g` is the first integer from input split, `h` is the second integer from input split, `n` is (a - e)² + (b - f)², `x` is (c - g)² + (d - h)². If `x > n`, then nothing specific changes. Otherwise, nothing specific changes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
