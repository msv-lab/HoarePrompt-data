Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is converted to an integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `k = int(k)` converts the string `k` into an integer. The value of `T` remains as `T - 1` from the initial state, and `n` is mentioned as an integer from the input, which does not change. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged values along with the updated value of `k`.
