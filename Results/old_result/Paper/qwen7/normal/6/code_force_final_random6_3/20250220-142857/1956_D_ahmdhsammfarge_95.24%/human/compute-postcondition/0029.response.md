Postcondition: `i` is 1, `j` is 2 or more, `len(lst)` is the length of the list `lst`, `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)`. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is 1 and `l` is 2 or more. Otherwise, no changes are made to `r` and `l`.
