Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program only considers subarrays of length 3 to determine the maximum possible value. However, according to the problem description, Mocha can choose any subarray [a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r] to perform the operation. The program fails to consider subarrays of different lengths, which could potentially yield a higher median value.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The program would only consider subarrays of length 3 and would output `4` as the maximum possible value. However, if Mocha chooses the entire array as the subarray, the median would be `3`, and setting all elements to `3` would result in the array `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`. Therefore, the correct output should be `3`.

Since the program does not handle all possible subarrays, it is not correct.
