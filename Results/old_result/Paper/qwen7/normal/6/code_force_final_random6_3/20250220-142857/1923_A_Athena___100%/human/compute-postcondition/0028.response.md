Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `res` is the previous value of `res` + 1, `i` is the previous value of `i` + 1**.

Explanation: The line `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. The value of `i` is updated to the previous value of `i` + 1, but since the exact value of `i` was not specified initially, we only state that `i` is updated accordingly. The list `a` remains unchanged.
