Let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`
   - `i = 1`
   - `n â‰¥ 1`
   - `a` is an integer value converted from the first word of the input split.
   - `b` is the second word from the input split converted to an integer.
   - `t = b * 2`

2. **Update Rule for `t`:**
   - If `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `t` is updated as follows:
     - If `a - t1 % 15 != 0`, then `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`.
     - If `a - t1 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15`.

Given these steps, let's determine the value of `t` after the update rule is applied.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Calculate `t1`:**
   \[
   t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
   \]
   Since `t = b * 2`, substitute `t`:
   \[
   t1 = (b * 2) * 15 - b * 4 = 30b - 4b = 26b
   \]

2. **Check the Condition:**
   - We need to check if `t1 >= a`.
   - Given `t1 = 26b` and `a` is an integer value from the input, we need to compare `26b` with `a`.

3. **Update `t` if `t1 < a`:**
   - If `26b < a`, then `t` is updated.
   - Calculate the difference:
     \[
     \text{difference} = a - 26b
     \]
   - Determine the number of 15s needed to cover the difference:
     \[
     \text{number of 15s} = \left\lfloor \frac{\text{difference}}{15} \right\rfloor
     \]
   - Check the remainder:
     \[
     \text{remainder} = \text{difference} \% 15
     \]
   - Update `t`:
     \[
     t = t + \text{number of 15s} + 1 \quad \text{(if remainder != 0)}
     \]
     \[
     t = t + \text{number of 15s} \quad \text{(if remainder == 0)}
     \]

### Final Value of `t`:

- If `26b >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged.
- If `26b < a`, then `t` is updated based on the above logic.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `t`. However, we know that `t` is initially `2b` and may be updated based on the conditions described.

### Output:

Output: **t (where t is the final value of t after applying the update rule, starting from 2b and potentially updated based on the comparison with a and the remainder calculation)**
