Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `elem in ldb`. The variables involved here are `elem` and `ldb`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `elem` in the list `ldb`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ldb` is a non-empty list.
   - If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, the size of `ldb` (`sz`) is increased by 2. Otherwise, the size of `ldb` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `ldb`, the size of `ldb` (`sz`) does not change within the loop body. The only thing that changes is the current element being processed (`elem`), but the size of the list itself remains the same as it was at the start of the iteration.
   - Therefore, the size of `ldb` (`sz`) remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The list `ldb` remains non-empty.
   - The size of `ldb` (`sz`) remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`ldb` is a non-empty list, and the size of `ldb` (sz) remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.**
