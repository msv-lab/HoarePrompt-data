Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `t` is 0.
   - `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input string.
   - `a` is the first element of `info`.
   - `b` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4.
   - `suma` is the sum calculated after all iterations of the loop.
   - `i` is `b + 1` after the loop completes.
   - `x` is the last value of `x` calculated within the loop, which is \((a - b \cdot (b - 1)) // b^2 + 1\) if \((a - b \cdot (b - 1)) // b^2 + 1 > 0\). Otherwise, `suma` remains unchanged and `x` is not incremented.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = b` inclusive.
   - For each `i`, the value of `x` is calculated as \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) if \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0\).
   - `suma` accumulates these values of `x`.

3. **Final Values:**
   - After the loop, `i` will be `b + 1`.
   - `x` will be the last value calculated for `x` during the final iteration of the loop, unless the condition \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0\) fails, in which case `x` does not change.
   - `suma` will be the sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the loop.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(suma - 2)`.

Given the above breakdown, let's determine the exact value that will be printed:

- Since `x` is calculated based on the condition \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0\), and this condition needs to be checked for each `i` from 1 to `b`, the value of `suma` will be the sum of all valid `x` values.
- After the loop, `i` will be `b + 1`, but this value is not directly used in the print statement.
- The print statement subtracts 2 from `suma`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `suma` minus 2.

Output: **suma - 2**
