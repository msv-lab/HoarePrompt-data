Output State: **`k` must be non-zero; `nums` is a deque with two fewer elements; `b` is `b` minus `x`.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is decremented by `x`. The other variables (`k`, `nums`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `k` must be non-zero and `nums` is a deque with two fewer elements is still valid. The value of `a` is not affected by the given code snippet.
