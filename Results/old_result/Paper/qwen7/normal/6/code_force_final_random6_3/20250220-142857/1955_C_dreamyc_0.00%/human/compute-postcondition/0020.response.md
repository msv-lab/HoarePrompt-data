Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is a non-zero integer, `nums` is a deque of `n-1` integers, `ans` is 1, `a` is the first element of the deque before popping, `b` is the last element of the deque before popping, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `k` is less than \(2 \times x\).**

The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` was set to 0, so now it is 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
