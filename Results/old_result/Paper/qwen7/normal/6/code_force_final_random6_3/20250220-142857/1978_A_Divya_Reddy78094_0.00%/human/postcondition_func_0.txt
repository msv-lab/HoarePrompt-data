The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer t indicating the number of test cases, an integer n indicating the number of books, and a list of n integers representing the number of pages in each book. It then sorts these page numbers in descending order and prints the sum of the first two page numbers for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
