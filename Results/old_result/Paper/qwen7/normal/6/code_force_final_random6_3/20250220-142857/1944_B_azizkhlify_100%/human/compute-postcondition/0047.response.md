Output State: **`i` is `current_i + 1`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `ul` is `current_ul + 6`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0.**

Explanation: The code `ul += 2` increments the value of `ul` by 2. Given that `ul` was initially `current_ul + 4`, after executing the code, `ul` becomes `current_ul + 6`. All other variables remain unchanged.
