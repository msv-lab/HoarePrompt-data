Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `j` is `adv-1`, `adv` is greater than 0, `ans` contains the values `a[n-2] - 2`, `a[n-2] - 1`, ..., `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1)`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`**.

Explanation: The code `cnt -= adv` decrements the value of `cnt` by `adv`. Since `adv` is greater than 0, `cnt` will be reduced by exactly `adv`. All other variables (`i`, `j`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
