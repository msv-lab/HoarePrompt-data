Postcondition: `ac` is either 1 or 2, `q` is 2, `bc` is either 0 or 1, `s` is an input string that must have at least one character remaining. If `i` equals 'A', then `ac` becomes either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `ac` remains either 1 or 2, `bc` becomes 1, and `s` remains an input string with at least one character remaining.
