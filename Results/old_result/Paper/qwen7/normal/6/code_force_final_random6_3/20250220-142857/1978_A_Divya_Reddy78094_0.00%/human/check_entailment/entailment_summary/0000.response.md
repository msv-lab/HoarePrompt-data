Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the list of book pages in descending order and then printing the sum of the first two elements. This approach works because the goal is to maximize the sum of the highest page count books in each pile. By sorting in descending order, the two largest values will be at the beginning of the list, and their sum will indeed give the maximum possible total number of pages Alice can read.

The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop to process each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n`, the list of page counts `nums`, sorts this list in reverse order, and then prints the sum of the first two elements.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
