Output State: **`k` is a non-zero integer, `a` is the first element of `nums` after removing the rightmost element, `b` is the last element of `nums` after removing the leftmost element, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, `nums` is modified by appending the old value of `a` to the left.**

Explanation: The code `nums.appendleft(a)` appends the value of `a` to the left end of the list `nums`. This operation does not affect the values of `k`, `b`, or `x`. It only changes the value of `a` to be the new first element of `nums` after the appendleft operation and changes `b` to be the new last element of `nums` after the leftmost element is removed. Therefore, the updated state includes these changes.
