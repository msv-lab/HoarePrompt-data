You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
    print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads two inputs: an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `v`. It then checks if for any index `i` from 1 to `n`, the value at `v[v[i]]` equals `i`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and exits. Otherwise, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is incorrect because the function should be called within the loop to process each test case.

3. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program initializes a list `v` with zeros.
   - It then updates this list with the input values, effectively creating a mapping from index `i` to `p_i`.

4. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if there exists a pair `(i, v[i])` such that `v[v[i]] == i`. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns, indicating that only two invitations are needed.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`, indicating that three invitations are needed.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Function Call:**
   - The function `func_1()` is not being called for each test case. Instead, `func_1()` is defined but never invoked in the main loop. This means the program will not process any test cases.

2. **Logic for Determining Minimum Invitations:**
   - The logic to determine the minimum number of invitations is flawed. The current implementation assumes that finding a single pair `(i, v[i])` where `v[v[i]] == i` is sufficient to ensure at least two friends come to the party. However, this is not always true. For example, consider the input `[2, 1]` where `n = 2`. Here, the program would incorrectly print `2` when it should print `2` as well, but the logic needs to handle more complex scenarios.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Check for pairs (i, v[i]) where v[v[i]] == i
    found_pair = False
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            found_pair = True
            break
    
    if found_pair:
        print(2)
    else:
        print(3)
```

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the original program is incorrect due to the missing function call and flawed logic. Therefore, the corrected program is necessary.
