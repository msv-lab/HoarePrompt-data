Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case.
3. The conditions for determining whether the numbers form a stair or a peak are correctly implemented:
   - `if a < b < c:` checks for a stair.
   - `elif a < b > c:` checks for a peak.
4. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.
5. The logic and conditions in the program match the problem description perfectly.
6. There are no logical errors or missing steps in the program.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic as specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
