Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is the length of the `results` list.
- `n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are final input strings stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration from 1 to `t`.
- `_` is `t`.

The `print(result)` statement will print the last element of the `results` list because `result` is not defined anywhere else in the snippet and it's assumed to refer to the last element of the `results` list.

Therefore, the output will be the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` when `t` is the number of iterations.

Output: **results[t-1] (where results[t-1] is the result of func_1(n, a, b, c) for the t-th iteration)**
