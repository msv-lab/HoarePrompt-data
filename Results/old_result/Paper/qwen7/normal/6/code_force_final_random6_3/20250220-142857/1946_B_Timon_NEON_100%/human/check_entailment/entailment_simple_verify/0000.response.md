### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code and the annotated version step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It is not used in the context of solving the problem and does not contribute to the solution.
   - **Conclusion**: This function is unnecessary and does not affect the correctness of the program.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find the maximum sum subarray, but it does not account for the possibility of inserting the sum of any contiguous subarray into the array multiple times.
   - The logic inside the function is indeed flawed and does not handle the insertion of sums into the array as required.
   - Specifically, the function does not consider the scenario where we can insert the sum of a subarray multiple times, which is crucial for maximizing the array sum.
   - **Conclusion**: The function `func_2` is incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is incomplete and does not contain any logic to solve the problem.
   - It initializes `answer` to 0 but does not perform any operations to maximize the array sum through the specified operations.
   - **Conclusion**: This function is also incorrect and does not contribute to solving the problem.

Given the problem description, the correct approach involves:
- Iteratively selecting and inserting the sum of any subarray into the array.
- Keeping track of the current maximum sum achievable after each operation.
- Ensuring the final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The provided code does not implement these steps. Instead, it attempts to find the maximum sum subarray, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
