Output State: **`test` must be at least 1, `t` is `t_prev + 1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are integers split from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts those parts into integers. These integers are then assigned to `a` and `b`. The values of `test`, `t`, and `a`/`b` are updated accordingly. The precondition that `test` must be at least 1 and `t` is `t_prev + 1` remains unchanged.
