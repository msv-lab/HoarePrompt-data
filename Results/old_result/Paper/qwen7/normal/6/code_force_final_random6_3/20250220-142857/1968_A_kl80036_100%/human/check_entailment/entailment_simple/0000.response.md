### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized for each given \( x \).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code iterates over a number of test cases specified by \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \) and sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \).
   - It then prints \( y \).

3. **Key Consideration**:
   - The goal is to maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
   - If \( y = x - 1 \), then \(\gcd(x, x-1) = 1\) because \( x \) and \( x-1 \) are consecutive integers and thus coprime.
   - Therefore, \(\gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = 1 + (x-1) = x\).

4. **Verification**:
   - The code always sets \( y = x - 1 \), which ensures that \(\gcd(x, y) + y = x\).
   - This is indeed the maximum possible value for \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) since \(\gcd(x, y)\) can at most be 1 (as shown above).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the constraints \( 2 \leq x \leq 1000 \) correctly.
   - The solution is valid for all \( x \) within this range.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find \( y \) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.

**Correctness: True**
