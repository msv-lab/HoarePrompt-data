Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0; `i` is either `N` or `2 * N`; `sumo` is increased by `int(a[i])`; `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates `sumo` by adding the integer value of `a[i]`. It also updates `a[i]` to the value of `prod // a[i]`. The conditions and values of `bets` and `i` remain unchanged from the initial state.
