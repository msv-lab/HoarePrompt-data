Output State: **`beg` is an integer, `end` is `mid` - 2, and `mid` is (`beg` + `end`) // 2 + 1**

Explanation: The value of `end` is updated to `mid - 1`. Given that `mid` was initially defined as `(`beg` + `end`) // 2 + 1`, the new value of `end` is `(`beg` + `mid` - 2) // 2 + 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `(`beg` + `mid` - 2) // 2`. However, since `mid` is not redefined, it remains as `(`beg` + `end`) // 2 + 1` with the updated `end`.
