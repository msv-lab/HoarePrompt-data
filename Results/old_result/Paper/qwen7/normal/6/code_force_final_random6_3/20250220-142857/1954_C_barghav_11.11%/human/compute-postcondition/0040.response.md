Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is 0.
2. It also states that `len(a)` must be greater than 0, meaning that the list `a` is not empty.
3. The `print` statement accesses the element at index `i` of the list `a` and prints it without a newline (`end=''`).

Given that `i` is 0, the code will print the first element of the list `a`.

Output: **a[0]**
