Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will be the sum of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for all child vertices `u` of `v`. Additionally, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` will be the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all child vertices `u` of `v` that have `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` less than `x`.**

This means that `tree.vertices[v].good_components` accumulates the `good_components` value from all child vertices, adding 1 for each child whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. Meanwhile, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` accumulates the `remaining_size` values of all child vertices, but only those with `remaining_size` less than `x` are included in the sum.
