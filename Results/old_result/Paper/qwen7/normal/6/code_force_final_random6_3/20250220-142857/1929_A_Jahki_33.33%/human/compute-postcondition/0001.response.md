State: **`order` is 0, `i` is 1, `num2` must be greater than 1** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, num2)`.
2. The range function in Python generates numbers starting from the first parameter (inclusive) up to but not including the second parameter.
3. For the loop to execute, the range function needs to generate at least one number, which means the start value (1) must be less than the stop value (`num2`).
4. Therefore, `num2` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
5. The variable `order` is not involved in the loop condition and its initial state does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.
6. The variable `i` starts at the beginning of the range, which is 1, so it should be set to 1.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are to set `i` to 1 and ensure `num2` is greater than 1.
