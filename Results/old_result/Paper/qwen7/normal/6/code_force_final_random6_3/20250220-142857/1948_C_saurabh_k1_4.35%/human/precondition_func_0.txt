t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even; the input consists of t test cases, each test case includes the width n of the grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even), followed by two strings of length n, where each string consists only of '<' and '>' characters representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid respectively.
