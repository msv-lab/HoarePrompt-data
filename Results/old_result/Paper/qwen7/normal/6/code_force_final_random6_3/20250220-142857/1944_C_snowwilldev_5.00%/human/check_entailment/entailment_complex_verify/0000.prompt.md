You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program: 
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import defaultdict

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. Each test case consists of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
        t = 0
        
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` will be equal to the total number of elements in `a`, `i` will be equal to `N + (N - 1)`, `N` will be the last value of `N` read from the input, `a` will be the list of integers obtained from the last input, `cnt` will be a defaultdict where each key from `0` to the maximum value in `a` will have a count corresponding to how many times that value appears in `a`. The loop will have processed all test cases, and once it processes the last test case, it will break out of the loop when `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0` is met for the last time.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `t` will be the total count of unique non-zero elements in `a` across all test cases, `i` will be the index of the last element processed plus the length of the last array, and the loop will have printed the first index `i` where either `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i]` becomes 0 for the last time before breaking.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each integer in the list and determines if there is an integer that appears exactly once. If such an integer is found, it prints the index of the first occurrence and breaks out of the loop. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and calculate the MEX of the array `c`. According to the problem description, Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a`, and the game ends when `a` is empty. The final score is the MEX of the array `c`.

The program attempts to count the occurrences of each number in `a` using a dictionary `cnt`. It then iterates through the range `[0, N)` and prints the first index `i` where either `cnt[i] == 1` or `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`. However, this approach does not simulate the game process correctly.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the input:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
```

The correct game process would be:
1. Alice picks `0` and appends it to `c`, so `c = [0]` and `a = [0, 1, 1]`.
2. Bob picks `0` and removes it from `a`, so `a = [1, 1]`.
3. Alice picks `1` and appends it to `c`, so `c = [0, 1]` and `a = [1]`.
4. Bob picks `1` and removes it from `a`, so `a = []`.
5. The final array `c = [0, 1]`, and the MEX is `2`.

However, the program will incorrectly print `0` because it checks the conditions prematurely and does not simulate the game process accurately.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
