### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice has `n` coins.
   - Bob wants Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel from 1 to \(10^{18}\).
   - Alice buys as many jewels as possible from each stall before moving to the next.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It checks two conditions:
     - If `n == k`, it prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with price 1.
     - If `n + 2 > k * 2`, it prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with specific prices.
     - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1 (`n == k`):**
     - If Alice has exactly `k` coins and each stall costs 1 coin, she can buy exactly `k` jewels.
     - This condition is correctly handled.

   - **Condition 2 (`n + 2 > k * 2`):**
     - This condition is more complex.
     - Let's break it down:
       - If `n + 2 > k * 2`, it implies that Alice has enough coins to buy at least `k` jewels with some leftover.
       - The solution only considers setting up 2 stalls with specific prices without ensuring that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
       - For example, if `n = 6` and `k = 4`, the solution would print "YES" and set up 2 stalls with prices 1 and 1, but Alice would buy 6 jewels, which is not correct.
       - The solution should dynamically adjust the number of stalls and their prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

   - **General Case (`n + 2 <= k * 2`):**
     - The solution incorrectly prints "NO" for cases where it should be possible to set up stalls to achieve exactly `k` jewels.
     - For example, if `n = 255` and `k = 8`, the solution should print "YES" and set up stalls with appropriate prices, but it prints "NO".
     - The solution needs to distribute the coins among the stalls in a way that ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The given solution does not correctly handle all test cases. It fails to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels and incorrectly prints "NO" in some valid scenarios.
   - The solution should dynamically adjust the number of stalls and their prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle all test cases and does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels in all valid scenarios.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
