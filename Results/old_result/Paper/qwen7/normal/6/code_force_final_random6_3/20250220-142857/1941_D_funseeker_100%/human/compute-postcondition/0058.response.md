Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `ans` will still contain at least one element, and `temp` will contain all possible values generated by the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`. The final state of `temp` will be the union of all sets generated during each iteration of the loop.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `temp` set will include every unique result obtained from adding and subtracting `r` to/from each element in `ans` modulo `n`, considering all possible values of `c` ('0', '1', or '?') during each iteration. The `ans` set remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
