Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `t` and `test`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `t < test`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `test` must be at least 1.
   - `t` is `t + 1`.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - If `a + b` is even, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
   - Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `t` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, `t` will be `t + 1` from the previous value.
   - The value of `test` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
   - The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `t` will be `t + 1` from its previous value.
   - `test` remains the same.
   - `a` and `b` remain the same.

Given that `t` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, let's denote the previous value of `t` as `t_prev`. Therefore, `t` in the next iteration will be `t_prev + 1`.

Since `test` must be at least 1 and does not change, it remains the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`test` must be at least 1, `t` is `t_prev + 1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.**
