Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` remains a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `result` is a list containing the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen` for each iteration where `space_x` exceeds `remaining_cells`.
- `x` and `y` are the last integers provided by the input split during the last iteration of the loop.

The `print` statement will join the elements of the `result` list into a single string with each element separated by a newline (`\n`). Each element in the `result` list is the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen` for the iterations where `space_x` exceeded `remaining_cells`.

Given the information, we cannot determine the exact values of `screen_require_for_y`, `extra_screen`, `space_x`, and `remaining_cells` without more details. Therefore, the output will be a series of lines, each representing the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen` for the respective iteration where `space_x` was greater than `remaining_cells`.

Output: **a list of sums (each sum is screen_require_for_y + extra_screen for each iteration where space_x > remaining_cells), each sum on a new line**
