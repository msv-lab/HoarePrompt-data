Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `index` is 2, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, `results` is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    k = int(data[index + 1])
    PB = int(data[index + 2])
    PS = int(data[index + 3])
    index += 4
    p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    result = func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)
    results.append(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `index` is 13 + 2 * n, `PB` is an integer from `data[6]`, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `k` is `int(data[4])`, `PS` is an integer from `data[9]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, data[index:index + n])

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `index` is 17 + 3 * n, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the new element `result`, `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]` using `map(int, ...)` and `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, data[index:index + n])`, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `a` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from `map(int, data[index:index + n])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `index` is 17 + 3 * n + 4 + 2 * n + n, `PB` is an integer from `int(data[index + 2])`, `t` is `t - 2`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the new result, `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is an integer from `int(data[index + 3])`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from index to index + n converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from `index` to `index + n` converted to integers.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
