Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through values from 3 to `m` and calculating a cumulative sum based on the given conditions. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of GCD and Multiples**: The program does not correctly calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` and check whether `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

2. **Incorrect Increment Logic**: The loop starts from 3, which is unnecessary and does not align with the problem requirements. The correct approach should iterate through possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.

3. **Incorrect Update of `ans`**: The update of `ans` inside the loop does not reflect the actual conditions specified in the problem statement.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
