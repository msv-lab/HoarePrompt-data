Based on the initial state provided:

- `mx` is 6.
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `x` is 13.
- `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values 6, 4, and 4.
- `i` is 2.
- `len(ansv)` must be at least 2.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(ansv[i], end=' ')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 2, so we need to look at `ansv[2]`.
- `len(ansv)` is at least 2, meaning `ansv` has at least two elements.

However, the value of `ansv` itself is not explicitly given. Since `ansv` must have at least two elements and `i` is 2, we can infer that `ansv` has at least three elements, with `ansv[2]` being the third element.

Given the context and the information provided, the most precise description of what will be printed is that it will be the third element of the list `ansv`.

Output: **ansv[2]**
