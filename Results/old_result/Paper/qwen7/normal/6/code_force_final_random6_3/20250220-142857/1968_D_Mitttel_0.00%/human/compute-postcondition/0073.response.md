Output State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps - 1`, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `score` is `score + 2 * a[current_pos - 1] + a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1]`, `steps` remains unchanged, `visited` dictionary remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is decremented by 1, `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]` updates the value of `current_pos` to the value of `p[current_pos - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the `current_pos` is updated, while `full_cycles`, `remaining_steps`, `cycle_pos`, `cycle_score`, `score`, `steps`, `visited`, `remainder_steps` stay the same as their initial states.
