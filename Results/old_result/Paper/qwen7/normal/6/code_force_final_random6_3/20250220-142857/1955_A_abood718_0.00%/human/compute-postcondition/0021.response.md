Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `A'` is an integer input, `B'` is an integer input, `C'` is an integer input, `X` is `A'` divided by 2.**

Explanation: The code `X = A // 2` assigns the value of `A` divided by 2 (using integer division) to the variable `X`. The values of `i`, `A'`, `B'`, and `C'` remain unchanged from their initial states.
