To determine what will be printed, we need more information about the initial state of the variables involved in the expression `sum_values[n]`.

Given the initial state is not fully specified, let's break down the components:

1. `sum_values`: This is a list or an array.
2. `n`: This is an index into the `sum_values` list.

Without knowing the specific values of `sum_values` and the value of `n`, we cannot determine the exact printed output.

Therefore, the most precise description we can provide is:

Output: **sum_values[n]** (where `sum_values` is the list and `n` is the index into the list).
