Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `b` must be a non-empty list with at least 2 elements

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The list `b` must still be a non-empty list with at least 2 elements to ensure the loop can continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 2
- `b` must be a non-empty list with at least 2 elements

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is 2, `b` must be a non-empty list with at least 2 elements**
