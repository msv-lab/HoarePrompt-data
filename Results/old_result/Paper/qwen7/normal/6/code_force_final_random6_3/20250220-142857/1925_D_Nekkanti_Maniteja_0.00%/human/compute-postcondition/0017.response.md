Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values for These Variables**:
   - `i` should be initialized to 0 (the starting point of the range function).
   - `k` is already given as the third integer input, but we need to ensure it is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be set to 0.
   - `k` should be set to the value of the third integer input and must be greater than 0.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - The other variables (`m`, `n`, `M`, `c`, `s`, `a`, `u`, `v`, `f`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `k`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `k` is the third integer input and must be greater than 0**
