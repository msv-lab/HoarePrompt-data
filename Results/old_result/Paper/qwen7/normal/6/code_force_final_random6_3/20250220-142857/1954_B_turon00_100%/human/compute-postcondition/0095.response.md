Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value (`ans`) and the value of `cnt`. However, since the initial value of `ans` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value after the operation. We only know that `ans` now holds the smaller of its previous value and `cnt`. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
