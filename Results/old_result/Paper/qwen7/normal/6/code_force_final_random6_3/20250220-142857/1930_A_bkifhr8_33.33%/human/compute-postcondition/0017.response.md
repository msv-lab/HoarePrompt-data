Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `ans` is the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`
- `ans_f` is an empty list
- `n` must be greater than 0

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(n * 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n * 2`.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (from 0 to 1).

### Adjusted States:
- `i` will be updated to 1.
- `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

### New State:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `i` is 1
- `ans` is the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` (unchanged)
- `ans_f` is an empty list (unchanged)
- `n` must be greater than 0 (unchanged)

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `ans_f` is an empty list, and `n` must be greater than 0**
