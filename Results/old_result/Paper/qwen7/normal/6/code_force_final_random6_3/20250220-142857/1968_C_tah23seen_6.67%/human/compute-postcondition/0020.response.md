Output State: **`i` is 6; `n` is the length of `arr` plus one; `ans[7]` is `arr[6] + ans[6]`; `ans[8]` is `ans[7] + ans[6]`; `arr[7]` is greater than or equal to `arr[6] + ans[6]`; `ans[8]` is updated to `ans[7] + ans[7]`**.

Explanation: The code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` updates `ans[8]` (since `i` is 6, `i + 1` is 7) to be the sum of `ans[7]` and `ans[6]`. Given that `ans[7]` is `arr[6] + ans[6]`, `ans[8]` is now updated to `ans[7] + ans[6]`, which is `(arr[6] + ans[6]) + ans[6]` or `ans[7] + ans[7]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
