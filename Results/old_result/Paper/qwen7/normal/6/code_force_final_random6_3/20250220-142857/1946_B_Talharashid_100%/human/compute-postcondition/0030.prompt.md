Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `c` is 0, `n` is the first integer entered, `k` is the second integer entered, both integers are at least 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer; `maxi` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele
        maxi = max(c, maxi)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `l` is a non-empty list of integers, `ele` is the first element of `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is set to the absolute value of `ele`. Otherwise, `c` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, and `maxi` is also updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `l` is a non-empty list of integers, `ele` is the second element of `l`, `c` is either the sum of `c` and the second element of `l`, or `c` is 0, and `maxi` is the maximum between the previous value of `c` and the second element of `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `l` is a non-empty list of integers, `ele` is the third element of `l`, and `maxi` is the maximum between the previous value of `c` and the third element of `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and the previous value of `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is the sum of the previous value of `c` and the third element of `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
