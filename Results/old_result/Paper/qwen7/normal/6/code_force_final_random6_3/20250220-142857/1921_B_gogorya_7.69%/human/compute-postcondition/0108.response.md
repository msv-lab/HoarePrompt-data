Output State: **`hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - 4` or `a1 - a2 - 3`, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + 3` or `abs(a1 - a2) + 2`, and `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `res` was previously defined such that if `hd > 0`, then `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + 2` or `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`. After executing `res += 1`, `res` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the new conditions for `res` become `abs(a1 - a2) + 3` or `abs(a1 - a2) + 2`. All other variables (`hd` and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
