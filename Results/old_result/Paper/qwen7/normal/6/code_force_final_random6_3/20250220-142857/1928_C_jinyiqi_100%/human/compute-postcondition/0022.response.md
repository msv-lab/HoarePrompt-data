Functionality: **The function accepts an integer \( x \) and returns a string. This string is formed by first listing the quotients of all divisors of \( x \) that are greater than or equal to the square root of \( x \), followed by the reverse order of all divisors of \( x \) that are less than the square root of \( x \).**
