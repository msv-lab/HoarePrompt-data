### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) fit into the settling pattern.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the position \( n \) and the number \( x \) Vasya received.
   - It checks two conditions using `func_1` to find potential values of \( k \).

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1(x)` returns all divisors of \( x \), including both the divisors and their complements.
   - The function is used to find potential values of \( k \) from the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).

4. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The code checks if \( (n + x - 2) \) and \( (n - x) \) are even.
   - If they are even, it uses the divisors found by `func_1` to check if they satisfy the condition \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \).

5. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The results are stored in a set to remove duplicates and then the length of the set is printed.

6. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic for finding divisors and checking the conditions seems correct.
   - The handling of duplicates by converting to a set is appropriate.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the conditions used to determine the valid values of \( k \).

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Condition 1:** \( (n + x - 2) \) must be even.
  - This condition ensures that \( n + x - 2 = 2m \) for some integer \( m \). This implies \( n + x \) is even.
- **Condition 2:** \( (n - x) \) must be even.
  - This condition ensures that \( n - x = 2p \) for some integer \( p \). This implies \( n \) and \( x \) have the same parity (both even or both odd).

- **Checking Divisors:**
  - The function `func_1` returns all divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
  - For each divisor \( s \) of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \), the condition \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \) is checked.
  - This condition simplifies to \( s \geq 2x - 2 \).

- **Flaw in the Condition:**
  - The condition \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \) should be \( s \geq 2x - 2 \).
  - However, the condition \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \) is incorrect because it simplifies to \( s \geq 2x - 2 \), which is not the intended condition.
  - The correct condition should be \( s \geq 2x - 2 \).

### Example to Illustrate the Flaw:
- Consider \( n = 10 \) and \( x = 2 \).
  - \( n + x - 2 = 10 \) (even).
  - \( n - x = 8 \) (even).
  - Divisors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10.
  - Divisors of 8: 1, 2, 4, 8.
  - Checking \( s \geq 2x - 2 = 2 \cdot 2 - 2 = 2 \):
    - For \( n + x - 2 \): 2, 5, 10 (valid).
    - For \( n - x \): 2, 4, 8 (valid).
  - The code will incorrectly include 2, 5, 10 from \( n + x - 2 \) and 2, 4, 8 from \( n - x \).

### Corrected Condition:
- The correct condition should be \( s \geq 2x - 2 \).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate due to the incorrect condition \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \). The correct condition should be \( s \geq 2x - 2 \).

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
