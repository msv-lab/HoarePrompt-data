Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players, `m` is an integer representing the number of throws and is now equal to `m - 1`, `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball, `ans` is a set that must contain at least one element and is now equal to `temp`, `r` is an integer converted from the string `r`, `c` is a string equal to either '0' or '?', and the tuple `(r, c)` is assigned the result of `func_1().split()`**.

This means that the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, and `temp` remain unchanged. The variables `r` and `c` are updated to the results of splitting the string returned by `func_1()`.
