Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables involved in the loop head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `n` to `2 * n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`.
   - The loop increments `i` in each iteration.

3. **Calculate the new value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` starts at `n + 1` and the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n + 2`.

4. **Check if the loop condition is satisfied:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.
   - Given that `i` starts at `n + 1`, the loop will continue as long as `n + 2 < 2 * n`.

5. **Adjust the state:**
   - `i` will be `n + 2`.
   - `r[a[i-1]]` (which was `r[a[n+1-1]]` or `r[a[n]]` in the previous iteration) will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, but since we are only asked to adjust the state at the start of the next iteration, we don't need to change this value yet.

Based on the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `n + 2`**
