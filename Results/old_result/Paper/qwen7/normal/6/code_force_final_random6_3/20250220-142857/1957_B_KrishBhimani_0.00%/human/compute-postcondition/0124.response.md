Output State: **`arr` is [1], `i` is 2, `c` is `n`, `ans` is a list with the value `k0 - sum(ans) + 1 << i` and `[0] * (n - len(ans))` appended, `k0` is `k`, `n` is an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, `k` (the second element of `l1`) is a non-zero integer, and `k` must remain non-zero for the next iteration.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is initially 1) to the list `arr`. After appending, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The values of `c`, `ans`, `k0`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
