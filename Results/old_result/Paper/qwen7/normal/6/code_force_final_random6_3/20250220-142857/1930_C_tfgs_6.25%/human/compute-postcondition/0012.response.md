Output State: **`counter` is a Counter object with elements {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, ..., n: 1}; `i` is `n-1`; `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` equals 2 for `0 ≤ i < n` and `a` is sorted in descending order.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `a` in descending order. Since each element in `a` was initially set to 2, sorting the list in descending order does not change the values of the elements. Therefore, the list `a` remains as a list where each element `a[i]` equals 2 for `0 ≤ i < n`. All other variables (`counter` and `i`) remain unchanged.
