### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem describes a game where players take turns removing a fixed number of stones `k` from each non-empty pile, with `k` being at most the size of the smallest non-empty pile. The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy for this game is based on the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). However, the provided code does not implement this strategy. Instead, it uses a different approach involving sorting and checking consecutive differences.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never called within the main loop.
   - The variable `nums` is initialized as a set of strings split from an input line, which is then converted to integers and sorted.
   - The logic inside `func_1()` checks the length of `nums` and prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on certain conditions, but these conditions do not correctly reflect the game's rules.

4. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the first test case (`3 3 3 3 3`), the code correctly identifies Alice as the winner because she can remove 3 stones from each pile, making all piles empty.
   - For the second test case (`1 7`), the code incorrectly identifies Bob as the winner because it does not correctly simulate the game's moves.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the game logic and thus does not produce the expected results for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not follow the correct logic for determining the winner based on the game rules.

**Correctness: **False**
