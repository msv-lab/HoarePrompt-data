Output State: `beg` is an integer, `end` is an integer, and `mid` is an integer. After all iterations of the loop, `beg` will be equal to `end`. This is because the loop continues to adjust `beg` and `end` until they converge, meaning `beg` will eventually become equal to `end` when the condition `beg < end` no longer holds true. The value of `mid` will be recalculated based on the final values of `beg` and `end` using the formula `(beg + end + 1) // 2` or `(beg + end) // 2 + 1`, depending on the outcome of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` in the last iteration.
