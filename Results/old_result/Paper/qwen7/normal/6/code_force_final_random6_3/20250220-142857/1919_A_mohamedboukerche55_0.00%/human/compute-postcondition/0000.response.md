Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` provides a non-negative integer value. However, since the problem specifies that `t` (which is the input) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), the loop will definitely execute because the input will always be within this range.

3. **Adjust the initial state**: The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`, and the value of `i` will start from 0 in the first iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 0 initially.

4. **Consider the input**: The value of `t` (the number of iterations) will be provided by `int(input())`, but since we know `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, we don't need to adjust the input itself, just ensure that the loop will run `t` times.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

- `i` should be 0 initially.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 0**
