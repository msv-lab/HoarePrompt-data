Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is 0, `n` is still 2, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `n` is now an integer input from the user, while `t` remains 0, `n` is still 2, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
