Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state is given as `i` is 0 and `b` is a non-empty list.
2. The print statement is `print(b[i], end='')`.
3. Since `i` is 0, the code will access the first element of the list `b`.
4. Because `b` is a non-empty list, it contains at least one element.
5. The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function means that there will be no newline after the printed element, but this does not affect the content being printed.

Given that `b` is a non-empty list and `i` is 0, the code will print the first element of the list `b`.

Output: **the first element of b**
