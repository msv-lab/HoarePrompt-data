Output State: **`max_sum` remains -1, `new_segment` becomes either an empty list, [arr[3] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], n-1], [arr[4] + arr[2] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 2], [arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 5], or [arr[4] + arr[2], 2], `max_segment` becomes either [2 + arr[1] + arr[3] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], [2 + arr[4] + arr[2] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], [1 + arr[1] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], [1 + arr[3] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], [1 + arr[4] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], [1 + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], or [1 + arr[4], 0] or [1 + arr[3], 0], `segments_variants` becomes a list containing all possible valid segment variants found during the loop execution plus the new_segment + [len(arr) - 1], `i` is n (where n is the length of `arr`), and `max_segment` is appended to `segments_variants` as [max_segment[0] + arr[-1], max_segment[1]], and `arr` remains a non-empty list; `total_max_segment` is set to [-1]**.

This means that the variable `total_max_segment` is now explicitly set to the list `[-1]`. All other variables retain their previous states as described.
