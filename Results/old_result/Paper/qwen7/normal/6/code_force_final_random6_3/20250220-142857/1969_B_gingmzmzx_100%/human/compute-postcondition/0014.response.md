Postcondition: `c` is the first element of `s`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated as follows: if `c` is 0, then `ans` is 1 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0, else `ans` is 0; if `c` is not 0, then `ans` is incremented by the number of zeros (`zeroes`) minus the count of zeros in `cnt[0]`.
