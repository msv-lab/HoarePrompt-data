Output State: **`total_cost` is increased by `price * tickets_to_buy`, `pq` is a heap with one less element, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, `tickets_bought` is updated to `tickets_bought + tickets_to_buy`, `price_increase` is 0, `price` is the price popped from the heap, `day` is the day popped from the heap, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`.**

This means that the `total_cost` has been updated by adding the product of `price` and `tickets_to_buy` to its current value. The `pq` heap has lost one element, `tickets_bought` has been increased by `tickets_to_buy`, and `tickets_to_buy` itself has been recalculated as the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`. All other variables remain unchanged.
