Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `t` is `k % 2`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `ans` is increased by 1, `l` is increased by 1, and `r` is decreased by 1.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If `a[r]` is equal to 0, then `r` is further decreased by 1. In all cases, the other specified conditions remain true.
