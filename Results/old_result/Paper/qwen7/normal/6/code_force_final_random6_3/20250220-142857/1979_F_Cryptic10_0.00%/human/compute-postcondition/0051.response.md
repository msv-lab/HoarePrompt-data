Output State: **`v` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`**.

Explanation: The code `v, u = func_1(d)` calls the function `func_1` with the argument `d`. The function returns two values, which are assigned to `v` and `u` respectively. Since the exact nature and values of the function `func_1` are not specified, we can only say that `v` and `u` take the values returned by the function call. All other variables remain in their initial state.
