Postcondition: **`remaining_cells` is 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an integer from the input split, the current value of `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, if `y` is an even number, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`, if `y` is an odd number, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1, and `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`.**
