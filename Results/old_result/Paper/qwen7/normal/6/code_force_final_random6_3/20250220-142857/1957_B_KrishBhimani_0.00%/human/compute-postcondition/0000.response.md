Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value used in the `range` function, which is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as the input value (converted to an integer) is greater than 0. Since the input is taken from the user, we cannot directly modify the input value, but we can infer the necessary condition.

3. **Initial state before the loop**: The initial state given is that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Given this information, the loop will execute as long as the input value is greater than 0. Since `t` is already a positive integer within the specified range, the loop will definitely execute based on the initial state of `t`.

However, since the loop body is omitted and we need to ensure the loop can execute, we should focus on the condition that the input value must satisfy. The input value must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Since the initial state of `t` is a positive integer, we can assume that the input value will also be a positive integer. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the initial state of `t` itself, but we need to ensure that the loop condition is met.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

This ensures that the loop can execute as the input value will be a positive integer, satisfying the condition for the loop to run.
