Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0; `steps` is 1; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is the first integer entered; `d` is the second integer entered; `e` is the first integer from the input split; `f` is the second integer from the input split; `g` is the first integer from the input split converted to an integer; `h` is the second integer from the input split converted to an integer; if `x > n`, then the current value of `x` remains unchanged and is still greater than `n`. Otherwise, the current value of `x` remains unchanged and is not greater than `n`.**
