Output State: **`elem` is the first element of `ldb`, `i` is 0, `sz` is `k + 2`, and `k - sz` is `-2`.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 2, making it `k + 2`. The other variables (`elem`, `i`, and the condition involving `k` and `sz`) remain unchanged. Since `sz` was originally greater than or equal to `k` and now is `k + 2`, the condition `k - sz` is now `-2`.
