Reasoning:
The provided solution attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest word based on the given encoding rules. Let's break down the logic and check its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over the number of test cases (`t`) and processing each test case individually.

2. **Encoding Logic**:
   - If `n > 52`, the word must start with the character at position `n - 53` and end with 'zz'. This covers the range from 53 to 78.
   - If `n > 27`, the word must start with 'a', the second character at position `n - 28`, and end with 'z'. This covers the range from 28 to 52.
   - If `n == 27`, the word is explicitly set to 'aay'.
   - Otherwise, the word is 'aa' followed by the character at position `n - 3`. This covers the range from 3 to 26.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is exactly 27, which results in 'aay'.
   - For other values, the logic constructs the word in a way that ensures it is the lexicographically smallest possible word.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed word for each test case, which matches the requirements.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically smallest word for each test case based on the given encoding rules.

Correctness: **True**
