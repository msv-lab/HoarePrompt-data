Output State: `bets` must be a positive integer; `i` will be either `N + (bets - 1)` or `2 * N + (bets - 1)`; `sumo` will be the sum of `int(a[i])` for each iteration from 0 to `bets - 1`; `a[i]` will be updated to `prod // a[i]` for each iteration from 0 to `bets - 1`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `bets` should still be greater than 0, and `i` will take the value of either `N + (bets - 1)` or `2 * N + (bets - 1)`. The variable `sumo` will hold the cumulative sum of `int(a[i])` for every index `i` that was updated within the loop. Each `a[i]` will be updated to `prod // a[i]` after being used in the summation.
