Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    a1 = s1.count('1')
    a2 = s2.count('1')
    hd = a1 - a2
    res = abs(a1 - a2)
    for i in range(n):
        if hd > 0:
            hd -= 1
            continue
        if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
            res += 1
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All iterations of the loop have executed, meaning `i` equals `n`, `hd` is `-n`, and `res` is the total count of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' from the start up to the last iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `hd` is less than or equal to 0 (specifically, it will be `- (n - 1)` if `n` is greater than 1), `res` is incremented by 1 for each position where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', and the values of `s2`, `a1`, `a2`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - n`, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + (n - 1)`, `i` is equal to `n`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` with each iteration until it reaches `n`. The value of `hd` decreases by 1 for each iteration where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', but since the loop continues when `hd` is greater than 0, `hd` will eventually reach `a1 - a2 - n` once `hd` can no longer be decremented. The variable `res` is incremented by 1 for each such iteration, resulting in `res` being equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + (n - 1)`. The counts of '1's in `s1` (`a1`) and `s2` (`a2`) do not change within the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
