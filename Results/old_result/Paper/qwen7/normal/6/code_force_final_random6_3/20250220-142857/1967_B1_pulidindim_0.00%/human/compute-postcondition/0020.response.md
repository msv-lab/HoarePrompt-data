Postcondition: `t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input split from `input().split()`, `m` must be greater than 3, `count` is 4, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 + 1)`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is `n / 4`, and if `g` is less than `countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
