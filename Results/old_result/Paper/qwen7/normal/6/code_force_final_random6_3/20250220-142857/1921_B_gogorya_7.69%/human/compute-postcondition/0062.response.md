Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `hd` is 0, `res` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `res` is incremented by 1. Since `res` was initially unchanged from its postcondition value of 0, it now becomes 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `hd`) remain unchanged from their respective postcondition values.
