Output State: `i` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `j` is the length of `arr` minus 2. 

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be either 0, 1, or 2, and `j` will be the length of the array minus 2. The loop continues to increment `i` and decrement `j` as long as the elements at these indices are equal. If at any point the elements at `i` and `j` are not equal, the loop breaks.
