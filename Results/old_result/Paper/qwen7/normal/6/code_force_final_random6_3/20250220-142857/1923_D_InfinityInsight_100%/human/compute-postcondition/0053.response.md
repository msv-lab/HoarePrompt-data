Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` must be greater than 2; `ans[3]` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
