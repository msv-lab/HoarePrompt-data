Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`. It also correctly reads the durability of the ships into a list `a`.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1(n, k, a)` with the parsed values and prints the result. This is done correctly.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - The function initializes pointers `l` and `r` to represent the leftmost and rightmost ships.
   - It maintains a count of sunk ships `sunks`.
   - It uses a while loop to simulate the attacks, alternating between attacking the leftmost and rightmost ships.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if there are enough attacks left (`k > 0`) and handles the case where only one ship remains.
   - For each attack, it checks which ship to attack based on their durability and updates the durability and the count of sunk ships accordingly.
   - The logic to handle the case where a ship's durability reaches zero and it is removed from further consideration is correct.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where all ships sink before the end of the attacks.
   - It correctly handles the scenario where the last remaining ship has exactly the required number of attacks to sink it.

5. **Output**: The function returns the correct number of sunk ships, which is printed by the main program.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
