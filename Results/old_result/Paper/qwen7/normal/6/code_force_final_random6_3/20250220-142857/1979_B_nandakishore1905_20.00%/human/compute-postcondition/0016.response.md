Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer input split from `t`, and `m` is the second integer input split from `t`; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. Either `n` is not equal to 0 or `m` is not even, and the absolute difference `k` is not a power of 2.
