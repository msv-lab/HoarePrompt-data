Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `sng` is an empty list, `sz` is `k` + length of `sng`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `lft` is the first `n` sorted elements of `lst`, `rgt` is the remaining elements of `lst` starting from index `n`, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `lft.sort()` sorts the list `lft`. Since sorting does not affect the values of other variables, the values of `T`, `sng`, `sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `rgt`, `ldb`, and `rdb` remain unchanged. The only change is that `lft` is now sorted.
