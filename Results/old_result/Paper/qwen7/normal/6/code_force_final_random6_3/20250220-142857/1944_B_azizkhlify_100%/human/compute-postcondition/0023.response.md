Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = n` to `i = 2*n - 1`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is within this range.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is initially set to `2 * n`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be in the range `[n, 2*n-1]`. Given that `i` starts at `2 * n`, it is clear that `i` will not be in the desired range because `2 * n` is always greater than `n` (since `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000).

5. **Adjust the state**: Since `i` starts at `2 * n`, which is outside the loop's range, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is within the range `[n, 2*n-1]`. To achieve this, we need to set `i` to `n`.

6. **Consider the value of `n`**: The value of `n` should be such that the loop can potentially run. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, we don't need to change its value; we just need to ensure that `i` is set correctly.

Given these considerations, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000**
