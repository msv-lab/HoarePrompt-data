Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases, `n`, and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Input Handling**: For each test case, it reads two integers, `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
3. **Initial Calculation**: It sets `t` to `b * 2`. This represents the initial placement of all 2x2 icons, which occupy 4 cells each.
4. **Adjustment Based on Divisibility by 5**: If `t` is not divisible by 5, it adjusts `t` to the next highest integer that is divisible by 5. This ensures that we account for the fact that each screen can hold up to 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).
5. **Calculate Remaining Space**: It calculates `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`, which represents the remaining space on the screens after placing all 2x2 icons.
6. **Check if Remaining Space Can Fit All 1x1 Icons**: If the remaining space (`t1`) is greater than or equal to `a`, it means all 1x1 icons can fit without needing additional screens. Otherwise, it calculates how many more screens are needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons.
7. **Final Calculation**: It adds the necessary number of additional screens to `t` and prints the result.

Now, let's verify if this logic aligns with the problem statement and examples provided:

- The program correctly calculates the initial number of screens needed to place all 2x2 icons.
- It then checks if the remaining space can accommodate all 1x1 icons.
- If not, it correctly calculates the additional screens needed.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the logic seems to be sound. However, there is a small issue with the calculation of `t1` and the subsequent logic. Specifically, the formula `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` might not always accurately reflect the remaining space available on the screens. 

To ensure correctness, we should directly calculate the total number of cells required and then divide by 15 to get the number of screens needed.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate total cells required
        total_cells = a + b * 4
        # Calculate number of screens needed
        screens_needed = (total_cells + 14) // 15  # Ceiling division
        print(screens_needed)
```

This corrected version ensures that the total number of cells required is calculated and then divided by 15 to get the minimum number of screens needed, ensuring accuracy.

Given the provided logic and the need for a direct calculation, the original program is not entirely correct. Therefore:

Correctness: **False**
