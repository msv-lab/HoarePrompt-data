Based on the initial state provided, the variable `ans` will be the concatenation of all elements in the list `a` separated by spaces. Since the list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot provide a specific value for `ans`. However, we can describe what `ans` will contain.

Let's assume `a` is a list with elements such as `['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']`. In this case, `ans` would be `'apple banana cherry'`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the concatenated string of all elements in the list `a` separated by spaces.

Output: **the concatenated string of all elements in the list `a` separated by spaces**
