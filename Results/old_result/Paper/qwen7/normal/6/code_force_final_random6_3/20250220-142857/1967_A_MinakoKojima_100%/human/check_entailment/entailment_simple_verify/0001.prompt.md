You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list `a` of size `n`.

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - The list `a` is sorted. This step is crucial because it helps in determining the gaps between consecutive elements.

3. **Initialization:**
   - `ans` is initialized to the smallest value in `a`.
   - `res` is initialized to `n - 1`. This variable will keep track of the remaining slots after placing the initial sequence.

4. **Iterating Through the Sorted List:**
   - The loop iterates through the sorted list to calculate how many additional cards can be bought and placed optimally.
   - For each pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list, it calculates the difference (`dif`).
   - If `dif` is zero, it means there are no gaps, so `res` is decremented.
   - If `dif` is non-zero, it checks if the available coins `k` are sufficient to fill the gap. If so, it updates `ans` and reduces `k` accordingly. Otherwise, it partially fills the gap with the available coins.

5. **Final Adjustments:**
   - After the loop, any remaining coins are used to fill the last segment of the sequence.
   - The final answer is calculated by adding the contributions from the initial sequence and the remaining slots.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Sorting the List:**
   - Sorting is necessary to identify the gaps between consecutive numbers efficiently.

2. **Handling Gaps:**
   - The logic for handling gaps is correct. It ensures that the maximum number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]` are formed.

3. **Final Adjustments:**
   - The final adjustments ensure that any remaining coins are used optimally to maximize the score.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `1 10`
  - `a = [1]`
  - Sorted `a = [1]`
  - `ans = 1`, `res = 0`
  - Output: `11` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `2 4`
  - `a = [8, 4]`
  - Sorted `a = [4, 8]`
  - `ans = 4`, `res = 1`
  - Output: `15` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `3 4`
  - `a = [6, 1, 8]`
  - Sorted `a = [1, 6, 8]`
  - `ans = 1`, `res = 2`
  - Output: `15` (Correct)

Based on the analysis and verification, the program appears to be correct and follows the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
