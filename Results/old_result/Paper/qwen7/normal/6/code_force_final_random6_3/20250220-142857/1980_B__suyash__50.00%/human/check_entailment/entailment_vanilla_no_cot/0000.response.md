Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program attempts to split the second input string `a` into a list of integers but should instead process the list of integers directly. The current implementation splits the string `a` which is not necessary and leads to incorrect handling of the input.

2. **Sorting Logic**: The sorting logic is flawed. The program sorts the list `o` and then tries to find the index of `fav`. However, it should sort the list of unique values (`l`) rather than the entire list `o`.

3. **Logic for Determining Removal**: The logic for determining whether the favorite cube will be removed is incorrect. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where the favorite cube might be removed due to multiple occurrences of the same value.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the cubes in non-increasing order
        sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
        
        # Find the index of the favorite cube in the sorted list
        try:
            fav_index = sorted_a.index(a[f - 1])
        except ValueError:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # Check if the favorite cube will definitely be removed
        if fav_index < k:
            print("YES")
        else:
            # Check if the favorite cube might be removed
            count_fav = a.count(a[f - 1])
            remaining_to_remove = k - fav_index
            
            if remaining_to_remove >= count_fav:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("MAYBE")

# Example usage:
func()
```

This corrected version properly handles the input, sorts the cubes, and correctly determines whether the favorite cube will be removed.
