Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` ranges from `1` to `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, the variables `i` and `n` are the ones that need to be adjusted.

2. **Understand the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `2`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `3`.

4. **Ensure `n` Meets the Condition:**
   - The condition `2 ≤ n ≤ 50` must still hold true.
   - Since no information about `n` changing is provided, we assume `n` remains the same.

5. **Check the Postcondition:**
   - The postcondition states that `v[v[i]]` should not be equal to `i`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `v[v[2]]` is not equal to `2`.

6. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented to `3`.
   - `n` remains unchanged and still satisfies `2 ≤ n ≤ 50`.
   - The postcondition for `v[v[i]]` remains valid for `i = 3`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `v[v[3]]` is not equal to 3**.
