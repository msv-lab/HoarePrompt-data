Output State: **`total_max_segment` is equal to `segment`; `segment` retains its original values.**

Explanation: The code `total_max_segment = segment` assigns the value of the list `segment` to the list `total_max_segment`. This means that `total_max_segment` now holds the same values as `segment`. The original values of `total_max_segment` and `segment` are preserved.
