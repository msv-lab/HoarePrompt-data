Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of list `b` minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`. If the length of list `b` is 0, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to the last element of list `b`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`.
