Output State: **`bullets_used` is `2 * health` more than its original value, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is now `2 * health + health`, `can_survive` remains unchanged, `pos` is the position of the next monster in the list, `health` is the health of the next monster in the list.**

Explanation: The code `bullets_used += health` increments the value of `bullets_used` by the current value of `health`. Given that initially `bullets_used` was `health` more than its original value, after executing the code, `bullets_used` becomes `2 * health` more than its original value. The other variables remain unchanged.
