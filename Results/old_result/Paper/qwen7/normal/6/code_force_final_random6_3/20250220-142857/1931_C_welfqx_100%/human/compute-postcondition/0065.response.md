Output State: **`ck` is increased by 1, `ii` is 2, `n` is a value such that the loop runs `n - 1` times and `n > 3`, `cn` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, and `num` is a list.**

Explanation: The variable `ck` is incremented by 1. The values of `ii`, `n`, `cn`, and `num` remain unchanged from their initial states.
