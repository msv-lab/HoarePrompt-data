Output State: **`flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `0`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`, and `cnt` is `0`**.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have decremented to `0` because it starts from `n-1` and is decremented in each iteration until it reaches `0`. The variable `ans` will hold the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` found during the loop's execution. The variable `cnt` will be reset to `0` after the last iteration since there are no more elements in `arr` to check. The other variables (`flag`, `t`, `n`, `i`, `ans`, `val`, and `cnt`) will retain their final values as described.
