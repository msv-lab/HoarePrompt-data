Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 3, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the third integer entered, `f` is the fourth integer entered, `g` is the first integer from input split, `h` is the second integer from input split.**

The code `g, h = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them using `split()`, and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. These two integers are then assigned to `g` and `h` respectively. The values of `t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f` remain unchanged.
