Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**

Explanation: The code `nums.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `nums` in descending order. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged, and `nums` is updated to be a sorted version of its original list in reverse order.
