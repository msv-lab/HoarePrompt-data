Postcondition: **`stack` will contain tuples of all the vertices in the subtree rooted at `v`, with their second element set to `False`, (postorder) is true, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and the current value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`.**
