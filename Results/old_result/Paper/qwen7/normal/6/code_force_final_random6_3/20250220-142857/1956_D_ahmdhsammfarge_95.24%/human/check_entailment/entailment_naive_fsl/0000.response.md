Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not seem to address the core requirement of maximizing the sum of the array elements through the specified operations. Instead, they appear to be attempting to find a subarray with the maximum sum plus the square of its length, which is not relevant to the problem.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to focus on finding the smallest missing element (MEX) for each subarray and setting all elements in that subarray to this MEX value. This process needs to be repeated until no further improvements can be made.

Here's a brief outline of what the correct solution should do:
1. Identify the smallest missing element (MEX) for each possible subarray.
2. Update the subarray with the identified MEX value.
3. Repeat the process until no further updates can be made.

The given functions do not implement this logic, hence the program is incorrect.
