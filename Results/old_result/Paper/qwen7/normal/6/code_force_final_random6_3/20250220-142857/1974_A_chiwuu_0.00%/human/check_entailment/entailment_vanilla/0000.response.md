Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculating Minimum Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The variable `t` is calculated as `b * 2`, which represents the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons.
   - If `t % 5 == 0`, it means the icons fit perfectly into some number of full 5x3 screens. In this case, `t` is divided by 5 to get the number of screens needed.
   - Otherwise, `t` is divided by 5 with a ceiling function (`t // 5 + 1`), ensuring that any remaining space is accounted for.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space:**
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This represents the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, it means there is enough space to place all 1x1 icons without needing additional screens.

4. **Handling Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
   - If there are not enough remaining spaces to place all 1x1 icons, the program calculates how many more screens are needed to accommodate the remaining icons.
   - `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`, representing the number of 1x1 icons that still need placement.
   - The number of additional screens needed is determined by checking if `t2 % 15 == 0`. If so, it adds `t2 // 15` to the total number of screens. Otherwise, it adds `t2 // 15 + 1`.

5. **Output:**
   - The final number of screens needed is printed for each test case.

### Testing the Logic

To verify the logic, let's test the program with the provided examples:

- For the first test case (`1 1`):
  - `b = 1`, so `t = 2`.
  - `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 1`.
  - `t1 = 15 - 4 = 11`, which is greater than `1`, so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `1`

- For the second test case (`7 2`):
  - `b = 2`, so `t = 4`.
  - `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 1`.
  - `t1 = 15 - 4 = 11`, which is greater than `7`, so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `1`

- For the third test case (`12 4`):
  - `b = 4`, so `t = 8`.
  - `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 2`.
  - `t1 = 30 - 16 = 14`, which is greater than `12`, so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `2`

- For the fourth test case (`0 3`):
  - `b = 3`, so `t = 6`.
  - `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 2`.
  - `t1 = 30 - 12 = 18`, which is greater than `0`, so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `2`

- For the fifth test case (`1 0`):
  - `b = 0`, so `t = 0`.
  - `t1 = 0`, which is less than `1`, so we need an additional screen.
  - Output: `1`

- For the sixth test case (`8 1`):
  - `b = 1`, so `t = 2`.
  - `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 1`.
  - `t1 = 15 - 4 = 11`, which is greater than `8`, so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `1`

- For the seventh test case (`0 0`):
  - No icons, so no screens are needed.
  - Output: `0`

- For the eighth test case (`2 0`):
  - `b = 0`, so `t = 0`.
  - `t1 = 0`, which is less than `2`, so we need an additional screen.
  - Output: `1`

- For the ninth test case (`15 0`):
  - `b = 0`, so `t = 0`.
  - `t1 = 0`, which is less than `15`, so we need an additional screen.
  - Output: `1`

- For the tenth test case (`8 2`):
  - `b = 2`, so `t = 4`.
  - `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 1`.
  - `t1 = 15 - 4 = 11`, which is greater than `8`, so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `2`

- For the eleventh test case (`0 9`):
  - `b = 9`, so `t = 18`.
  - `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 4`.
  - `t1 = 60 - 36 = 24`, which is greater than `0`, so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `5`

### Conclusion

After testing the program with the provided examples, the logic appears to be correct. The program accurately calculates the minimum number of screens needed based on the given constraints.
