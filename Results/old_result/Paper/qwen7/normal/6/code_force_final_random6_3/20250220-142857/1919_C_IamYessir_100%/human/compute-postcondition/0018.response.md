Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list where `x` is the last element of `a`, the list `b` is not empty, `y` is the last element of `b`**.

This means that the value of `y` is now set to the last element of the list `b`, while all other variables retain their previous states.
