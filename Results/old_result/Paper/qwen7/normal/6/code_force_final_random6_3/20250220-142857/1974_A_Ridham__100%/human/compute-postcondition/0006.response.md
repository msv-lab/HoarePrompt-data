Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an integer from the input split, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `total_space` by adding `space_y` and `space_x`. Since `space_x` is equal to `x` and `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is now equal to `y * 4 + x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
