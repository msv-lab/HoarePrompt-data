Output State: **`day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `h` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and now `h` and `m` are updated to the integer values from the input separated by a colon.**

Explanation: The code `h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))` takes an input from the user in the format "HH:MM" (where HH is hours and MM is minutes), splits the input at the colon, and converts both parts to integers. These values are then assigned to `h` and `m`. The `day` variable remains unchanged.
