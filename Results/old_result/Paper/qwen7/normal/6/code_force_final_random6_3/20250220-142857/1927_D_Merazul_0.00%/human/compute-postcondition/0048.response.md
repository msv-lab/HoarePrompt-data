Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be at least 3, `u` is False, `v` is False, `f` is False, `m` is the same as before, `n` is `n - (~False & False)` which simplifies to `n - 0` or just `n` since anything ANDed with False is False.**

In natural language: `i` remains 2, `k` must still be at least 3, `u` and `v` remain False, `f` remains False, `m` remains unchanged, and `n` remains unchanged as well since `~u & v` evaluates to False, subtracting 0 from `n` does not change its value.
