Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is an input string, `a` is the first integer from the split string representation of `s`, `b` is the second integer from the split string representation of `s`, `s` is updated to the new input string.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. This updates the value of `s` to the new input string. The values of `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
