Functionality: **The function processes a single test case where `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000, and `X` is an integer within the range of 2 to 10^18. It calculates a sequence of integers and prints the count of unique integers in this sequence followed by the integers themselves. The function does not return any value.**
