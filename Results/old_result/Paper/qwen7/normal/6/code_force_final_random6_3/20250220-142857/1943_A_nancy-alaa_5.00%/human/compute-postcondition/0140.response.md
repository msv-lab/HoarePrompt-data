Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list a containing n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i < n). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a list of `n` non-negative integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case, adhering to the specified constraints.
