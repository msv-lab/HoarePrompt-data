Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be at least 1 (though its exact value is not relevant to the print statement).
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element in the string `a` split by spaces into integers.
- `o` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by spaces.
- `n` is the first element of the list `b`.
- `f` is the second element of the list `b`.
- `k` is the third element of the list `b`.
- The condition `k == n` is true.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'` without referencing any variables, the output will be exactly as specified.

Output: **YES**
