Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000.
2. `n` is equal to `k`, where `k` is an integer read from standard input.
3. `_` is explicitly stated to be 1.
4. The print statement is `print(1)`.

Given this information, the print statement will simply output the number 1, as it is explicitly provided in the print statement itself.

Output: **1**
