Output State: **`vals` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `den` is the result of calling `func_1(den, x)`**.

Explanation: The code `den = func_1(den, x)` assigns the return value of the function `func_1(den, x)` to the variable `den`. The initial state of `vals` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it. The value of `den` is updated to whatever `func_1(den, x)` returns. Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, we only know that `den` is now the result of applying `func_1` to its current value and `x`.
