Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676 (though this value does not affect the print statement).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.

The print statement is:
```python
print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k]` slices the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' from the start up to but not including the character at index `k`. For example, if `k` is 5, it would be 'abcde'.
2. The sliced string is then repeated `n` times. For example, if `k` is 5 and `n` is 3, the result would be 'abcdeabcdeabcde'.

Therefore, the output will be the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' sliced up to index `k` and repeated `n` times.

Output: **'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n**
