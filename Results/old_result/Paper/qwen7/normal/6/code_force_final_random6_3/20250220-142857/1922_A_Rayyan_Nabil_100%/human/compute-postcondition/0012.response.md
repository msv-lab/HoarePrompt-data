Output State: **`n` is the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the input string after stripping, `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `_` is 1, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `c = input().strip()` takes the current value of `c` (which is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace), and reassigns it to `c`. Since `c` was already stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, reassigning it to itself does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged.
