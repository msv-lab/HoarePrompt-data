Output State: **`path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n.**

Explanation: The code `remaining_vertices = set(range(1, n + 1))` creates a new set containing integers from 1 to n, which replaces the previous value of `remaining_vertices`. The variable `path` remains unchanged as an empty list.
