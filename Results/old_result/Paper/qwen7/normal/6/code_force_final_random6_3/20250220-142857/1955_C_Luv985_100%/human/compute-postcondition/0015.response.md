Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`**.

Explanation: The code `a[l] -= mi` decreases the value of `a[l]` by the value of `mi`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
