### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the provided code and the function `func_1` based on the problem description and the given example.

1. **Input Reading and Preparation:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates through each test case, reading `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
   - It reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - It adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` to be zero-based (subtracting 1 from each element).
   - This part is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` for `k` turns.
   - It initializes variables `mx` to store the maximum score, `cur` to store the current score, and `vis` to keep track of visited positions.
   - It enters a loop that continues until `k` turns are completed or all positions are visited.
   - Inside the loop:
     - It marks the current position as visited.
     - It updates the maximum score considering the remaining turns (`k`).
     - It adds the current position's score to the current score.
     - It decrements the number of remaining turns.
     - It moves to the next position according to the permutation.
   - This logic seems to correctly simulate the game for one player.

3. **Game Outcome Calculation:**
   - After calculating the scores for both players using `func_1`, it compares the scores.
   - It prints 'Draw' if the scores are equal.
   - It prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher.
   - It prints 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher.
   - This part also aligns with the problem statement.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- For the first test case:
  - `n = 4`, `k = 2`, `pb = 3`, `ps = 2`
  - Permutation: `[3, 1, 2, 0]`
  - Array: `[5, 7, 2, 6]`

  - **Bodya's score calculation:**
    - Start at position 2.
    - First turn: Score = 2, Position = 2.
    - Second turn: Score = 2 + 6 = 8, Position = 0.
    - Final score = 8.

  - **Sasha's score calculation:**
    - Start at position 1.
    - First turn: Score = 7, Position = 1.
    - Second turn: Score = 7 + 2 = 9, Position = 2.
    - Final score = 9.

  - Since Sasha's score (9) is higher than Bodya's score (8), the output should be 'Sasha'.

Given the code logic and the example, the code correctly implements the game rules and calculates the scores accurately.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided code is correct and follows the problem statement accurately.

**Final: True**

The original assessment was accurate.
