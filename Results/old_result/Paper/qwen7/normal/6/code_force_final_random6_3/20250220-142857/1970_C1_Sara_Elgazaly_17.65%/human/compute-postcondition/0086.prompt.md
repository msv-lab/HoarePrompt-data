Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is True, `x` is the final value it was set to (at least 1 more than the number of times the loop runs), `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user, and `lst` is a dictionary where each key has a list of all keys that are connected to it via the pairs entered during the loop's iterations.
Code of the loop:
while lst[x] != []:
    while lst[x]:
        y = lst[x].pop()
        if lst[y] != []:
            x = y
            break
    s = not s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is False, `x` is equal to `y`, `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user, `y` is the popped element from `lst[x]`, and `lst[x]` is now an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `s` is True, `x` is equal to `y`, `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user, `y` is the final popped element from `lst[x]`, and `lst[x]` is now an empty list.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `s` is False, `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user, `x` is equal to `y`, and `lst[x]` is empty.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
