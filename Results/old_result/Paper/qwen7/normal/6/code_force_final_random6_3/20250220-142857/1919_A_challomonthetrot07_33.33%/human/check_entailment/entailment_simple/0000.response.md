Reasoning:
1. The problem involves determining the winner of a game based on the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
2. The annotated program correctly handles the different conditions specified in the problem statement.
3. Let's analyze the logic:
   - If `a == b`, Bob wins because Alice cannot force a swap when both have the same number of coins.
   - If `a == 1`, Alice wins because she can force Bob to swap, leaving him with 0 coins.
   - If `b == 1`, Bob wins for the same reason as above.
   - If `a % 2 == 1`, Bob wins because Alice cannot force a swap and will eventually be left with 0 coins.
   - If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`, Alice wins because she can force a swap and leave Bob with an odd number of coins, which he cannot force back into an even number.
   - If `a > b`, Bob wins because he can force a swap and leave Alice with fewer coins than Bob.
   - Otherwise, Alice wins.

4. The program correctly implements these conditions and outputs the appropriate winner for each test case.

Given the analysis, the provided program logic matches the problem statement and the examples provided. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
