Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b`, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`. If `len(a)` is 0, then `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged; `y` is equal to the last element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the last element of list `b` to the variable `y`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `x`, or the conditions related to them. Therefore, these remain unchanged from their initial state. The only new information is that `y` now holds the value of the last element of list `b`.
