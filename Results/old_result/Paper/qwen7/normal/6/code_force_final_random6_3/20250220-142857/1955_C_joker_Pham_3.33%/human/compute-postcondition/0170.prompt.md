You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and a is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n.
def func_1(n, k, a):
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    sunks = 0
    while l <= r:
        if k == 0:
            break
        
        if l == r:
            if k >= a[r]:
                sunks += 1
                break
            break
        
        if a[l] <= a[r]:
            if k >= a[l] * 2:
                k -= a[l] * 2
                a[r] -= a[l]
                if a[r] == 0:
                    sunks += 1
                    r -= 1
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
                continue
            elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
                sunks += 1
                break
            else:
                break
        
        if k == 0:
            break
        
        if a[r] < a[l]:
            if k >= a[r] * 2:
                k -= a[r] * 2
                a[l] -= a[r]
                if a[l] == 0:
                    sunks += 1
                    l += 1
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
                continue
            elif a[r] * 2 - 1 == k:
                sunks += 1
                break
            else:
                break
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute until either `l` exceeds `r` or `k` becomes zero. After all iterations, `sunks` will be the total count of valid operations performed on the list `a`. The final values of `l` and `r` will indicate the remaining bounds of the unprocessed elements in the list, and `k` will be the remaining value after all possible operations have been attempted. If `k` is exactly `2 * a[r] - 1` when `l == r`, `sunks` will be incremented by 1 and the loop will break. Otherwise, `sunks` will reflect the total number of valid operations performed throughout the iterations.
    #
    #In more detail, `sunks` will be the sum of all increments made during each iteration of the loop, indicating how many times the conditions were met to perform operations on the list `a`. The values of `l` and `r` will pinpoint the current boundaries of the list segment that has not yet been processed. The variable `k` will hold the remaining value that could not be used to further reduce the elements in the list according to the specified rules.
    return sunks
    #The program returns `sunks`, which is the total count of valid operations performed on the list `a`. The final values of `l` and `r` indicate the remaining bounds of the unprocessed elements in the list, and `k` is the remaining value after all possible operations have been attempted.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and `a` (a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n). It returns `sunks`, which is the total count of valid operations performed on the list `a`. The function also returns the final values of `l` and `r`, indicating the remaining bounds of the unprocessed elements in the list, and `k` is the remaining value after all possible operations have been attempted.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `sunks`, which is the total count of valid operations performed on the list `a`. The final values of `l` and `r` indicate the remaining bounds of the unprocessed elements in the list, and `k` is the remaining value after all possible operations have been attempted.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
