Output State: **`cou` is 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1` and we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `cou` or `i`, and the loop condition remains the same (as long as `freq[i]` is not greater than or equal to 2), the values of these variables remain unchanged. The only effect is that the loop will continue to the next iteration.
