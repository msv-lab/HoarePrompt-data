Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < n - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - Either the element at index `j` of `num` is not equal to the element at index `j + 1` of `num`, in which case `f` is 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, or the element at index `j` of `num` is equal to the element at index `j + 1` of `num`, and no change occurs to `f`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop condition is `j < n - 1`, and `j` is currently 0, the loop will run again as long as `n > 1`.
   - After the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 1.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1 (since the loop condition depends on `j < n - 1`).

6. **Consider the Postcondition**:
   - The postcondition remains the same for the next iteration, but now `j` will be 1 instead of 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and either the element at index `j` of `num` is not equal to the element at index `j + 1` of `num`, in which case `f` is 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, or the element at index `j` of `num` is equal to the element at index `j + 1` of `num`, and no change occurs to `f`.**
