Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program is not correct because:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Moves**: The logic to calculate `n` after the initial moves is flawed. Specifically, the program subtracts 2 from `n` whenever `a != b` and subtracts 1 when `a == b`. However, this does not correctly account for the remaining valid positions on the board. The correct approach should consider the number of remaining rows and columns that are still available.

2. **Function `func_1` Implementation**: The function `func_1` calculates something that is not directly related to the problem's requirements. This function seems to be calculating some kind of dynamic programming solution, but it is not aligned with the logic needed to solve the problem of counting the number of valid final configurations.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to calculate the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining board after the initial moves. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
mod = 10**9 + 7

for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    remaining_n = n - k  # Number of rows and columns left after k moves
    
    # Calculate the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining board
    ans = 1
    for i in range(remaining_n):
        ans = (ans * (n - i)) % mod
    
    print(ans)
```

This approach correctly calculates the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining board by considering the number of available rows and columns after the initial moves.
