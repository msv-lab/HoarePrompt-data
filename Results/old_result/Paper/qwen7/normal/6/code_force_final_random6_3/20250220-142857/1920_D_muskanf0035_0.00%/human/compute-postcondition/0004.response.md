Output State: **`queries` is a list of integers converted from input, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5, `operations` is a list of n lists, each containing two integers b and x where b ∈ {1, 2} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `queries` is a list of q integers k_i where 1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c) and c is the size of the array after performing all n operations.**

Explanation: The code `queries = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `queries`. The values of `n`, `q`, and `operations` remain unchanged from their initial state.
