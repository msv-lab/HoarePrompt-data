Output State: **`cou` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues as long as `freq[i]` is not greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation: The variable `cou` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 1. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 as part of the loop condition, but its exact new value is not specified since it was already incremented before this line. The loop condition remains the same, continuing as long as `freq[i]` is not greater than or equal to 2.
