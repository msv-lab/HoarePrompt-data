Postcondition: `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split, and `t` is adjusted based on whether it is divisible by 5 or not, and `t1` is less than `a`, and `t2` is not divisible by 15.
