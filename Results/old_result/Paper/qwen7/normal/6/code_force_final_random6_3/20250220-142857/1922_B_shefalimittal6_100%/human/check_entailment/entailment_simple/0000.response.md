Reasoning:
1. The program reads the input correctly, splitting it into multiple test cases.
2. It initializes an array `v` to count occurrences of each stick length.
3. It iterates through the input data, updating the counts in `v`.
4. For each test case, it calculates the number of valid triangles using combinatorial logic:
   - Triangles with at least 3 sticks of the same length: \( \text{v}[i] * (\text{v}[i] - 1) * (\text{v}[i] - 2) // 6 \)
   - Triangles with at least 2 sticks of the same length: \( \text{cnt} * \text{v}[i] * (\text{v}[i] - 1) // 2 \)
5. The final result is stored in `results` and printed correctly.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
