Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 30000 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\), the value of `t` remains within this range after the assignment. All other conditions and lists remain unchanged.
