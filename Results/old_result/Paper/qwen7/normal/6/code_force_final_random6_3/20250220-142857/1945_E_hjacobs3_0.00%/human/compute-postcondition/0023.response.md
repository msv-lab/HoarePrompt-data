Output State: The list `array` remains a permutation of integers of length `n`, `l` is either 0 or the final value it takes after the last iteration, `r` is either `mid - 1` or 0, and `mid` is the final midpoint calculated as `(l + r) // 2`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `array` stays the same, `l` will be either 0 or the last computed midpoint plus one, `r` will be either the last computed midpoint minus one or 0, and `mid` will be the final midpoint value. The loop terminates when `l` becomes greater than `r`, indicating that the search range has been exhausted without finding an element that meets the condition `array[mid] >= find`.
