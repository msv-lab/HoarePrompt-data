Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `nums`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: 
   - `i` is initially set to 1.
   - `nums` is a sorted list of integers.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each index in the range of `len(nums)`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(nums)`.

4. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ls` is `nums[0]`.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `N` is an input integer.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `nums` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `nums[i]` is decreased by 0 (meaning it remains unchanged).

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.
   - The value of `nums[i]` will be accessed, which means `nums[2]` will be considered in the next iteration.

6. **Final state before the next iteration**:
   - `ls` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `N` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remains unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `nums` remains unchanged as it is not directly modified within the loop head.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `nums[i]` is still the same as `nums[2]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `ls` is `nums[0]`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 2, and `nums[i]` is decreased by 0.**
