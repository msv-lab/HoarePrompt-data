Based on the initial state provided:

- `sumo` is the original value plus the sum of `int(a[i])` for all `i` in the range of `bets`.
- `bets` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `T` is 0.
- `n`, `k`, `g`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged.
- `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `bets`, where `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all integers in list `a` after the updates.
- The current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print(-1)
```

This statement will print the integer `-1` regardless of the values of any other variables or objects.

Output: **-1**
