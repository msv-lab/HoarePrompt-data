Output State: `adv` must be at least 3, `j` is 2, `ans` is a list with three elements which are `a[i-1] - 3`, `a[i-1] - 3`, and `a[i-1] - 2`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `adv` must have been at least 3 (since it determines the number of iterations), `j` will be 2 (as it increments by 1 each time through the loop), and `ans` will be a list containing the values `a[i-1] - 3`, `a[i-1] - 3`, and `a[i-1] - 2`.
