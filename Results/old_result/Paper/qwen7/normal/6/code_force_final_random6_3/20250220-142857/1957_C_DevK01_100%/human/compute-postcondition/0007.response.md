Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `dp` is a list containing [6, 28].
   - `i` is 5.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 2 to `n + 1`. This means `i` starts from 2 and goes up to `n` (inclusive).

4. **Analyze the current value of `i`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 5.

5. **Determine the next value of `i`**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, the next value of `i` will be 6.

6. **Determine the value of `n`**:
   - Since `i` starts from 2 and goes up to `n`, and the current value of `i` is 5, it implies that `n` must be at least 5.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain the same or increase, but since no specific change to `n` is mentioned, we assume `n` remains the same as the last valid value, which is 5.

7. **Adjust the states**:
   - `dp` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `i` is adjusted to 6.
   - `n` must be at least 6 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`dp` is a list containing [6, 28], `i` is 6, `n` must be at least 6**
