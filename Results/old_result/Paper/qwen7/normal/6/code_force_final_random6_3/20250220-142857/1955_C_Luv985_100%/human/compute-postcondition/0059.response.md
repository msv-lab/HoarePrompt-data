Output State: **`k` is reduced by 2 times the value of `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `r` is greater than `l`, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, where `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`. The other conditions and changes to `a[l]` and `a[r]` remain unchanged.
