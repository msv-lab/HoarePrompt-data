Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans_list` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = a[0]
    res = n - 1
    for i in range(n - 1):
        dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
        if dif == 0:
            res -= 1
        if dif != 0:
            if k >= dif * (i + 1):
                ans += dif
                k -= dif * (i + 1)
                res -= 1
            else:
                ans += k // (i + 1)
                if i != 0:
                    res += k % (i + 1)
                k = 0
                break
            if k == 0:
                break
    if k != 0:
        ans += k // n
        res += k % n
    ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)
    ans += res
    ans_list.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is incremented by `res`, `res` is a non-negative integer which has been decremented by `n-1`, `ans` is incremented by `k // n`, `res` is incremented by `k % n` if `k` is not fully consumed (i.e., `k != 0`), `res` is further adjusted by subtracting 5 plus the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` if `k` is not 0, `ans_list` contains the current value of `ans`, `dif` is the difference between consecutive elements in list `a`, and `i` is incremented with each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `dif` is 0, `ans` is increased by `res`, `k` is 0, `res` is adjusted by adding `k % n` which is 0, `ans_list` contains the final value of `ans` after all iterations, the `a` list remains unchanged, and `ans_list` now includes the updated value of `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `res` is `k % n - 1`, `k` is not 0, `ans` is `2 * (a[2] - a[1]) + k // n`, `ans_list` contains `[2 * (a[2] - a[1]) + k // n]`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
