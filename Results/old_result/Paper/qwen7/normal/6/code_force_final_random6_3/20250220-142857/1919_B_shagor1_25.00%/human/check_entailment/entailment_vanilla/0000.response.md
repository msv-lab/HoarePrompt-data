### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to minimize the penalty by splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s` into subarrays.
   - The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The goal is to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - It calculates the number of `-` characters (`neg`) in the string `s`.
   - It then prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic in `func_1()` does not directly address the problem's requirements. Specifically, it does not handle the splitting of the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty.
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` is not derived from the problem statement and does not ensure the minimum penalty.
   - The problem requires finding the optimal way to split the array, which involves dynamic programming or a similar approach to minimize the total penalty.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It does not implement the required logic to find the minimum possible penalty.

### Correctness: **False**
