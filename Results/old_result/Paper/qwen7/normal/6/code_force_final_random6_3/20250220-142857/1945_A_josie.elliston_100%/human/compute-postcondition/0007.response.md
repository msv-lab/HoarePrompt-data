Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`, both non-negative integers. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and `(extroverts % 3 + universals)` is at least 3, it adjusts `universals` so that `(extroverts % 3 + universals)` equals 3. The function then returns the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals)` divided by 3. If the initial condition is not met, the function returns `None`.**
