Output State: **`i` is less than `n * 2`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and the second element of `lst` is removed.**

Explanation: The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index `2` (since `1 * 2` equals `2`) from the list `lst`. This means the second element of `lst` is removed. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
