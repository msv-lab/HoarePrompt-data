Output State: **`segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is a non-empty list with its first element increased by `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is [arr[i], arr[i]], `max_sum` is -1.**

Explanation: The code `new_segment[0] += arr[i]` increases the first element of the list `new_segment` by the value of `arr[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
