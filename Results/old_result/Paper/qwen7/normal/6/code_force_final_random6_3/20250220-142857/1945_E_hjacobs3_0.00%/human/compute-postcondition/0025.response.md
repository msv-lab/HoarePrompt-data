Based on the initial state provided:

- `array` is a permutation of integers of length `n`.
- `l` will be either 0 or the last computed midpoint plus one.
- `r` will be either the last computed midpoint minus one or 0.
- `mid` will be the final midpoint value.
- The current value of `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the list `array`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(1)
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the integer `1`. Since no other variables or objects are involved in this specific line of code, the output is straightforward.

Output: **1**
