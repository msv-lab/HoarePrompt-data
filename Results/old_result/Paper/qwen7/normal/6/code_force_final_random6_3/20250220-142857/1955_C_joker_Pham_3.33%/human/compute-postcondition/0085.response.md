Output State: **`sunks` is increased by 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range from 1 to `n`, `l` is increased by 1 and `r` is unchanged, `a[r]` is reduced by `a[l]`, and `k` remains unchanged if `k == 0`.**

Explanation: The line `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. All other variables remain in their original state according to the initial conditions.
