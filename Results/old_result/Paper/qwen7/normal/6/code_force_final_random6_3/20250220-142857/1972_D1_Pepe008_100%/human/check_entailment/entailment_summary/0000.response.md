Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate `suma` using a formula that does not align with the problem statement. Specifically, the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and the subsequent checks do not correctly determine the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

2. **GCD Consideration**: The program does not account for the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`, which is a crucial part of the problem statement. The solution should involve checking the gcd of `a` and `b` to ensure the condition is met.

3. **Logic Flaw**: The program incorrectly increments `suma` based on the gcd condition without properly iterating through all possible valid pairs `(a, b)`.

Given these issues, the provided implementation does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
