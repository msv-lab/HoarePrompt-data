Output State: **`i` is either `n-6` or `n-7`, `k` is updated as `k * a[q2] % m` if `t[i] == 'R'`, otherwise `k` is updated as `k * a[q1] % m`. In both cases, `y[i]` is assigned the value of the updated `k`. Additionally, if `t[i] == 'R'`, `q2` is incremented by 1, otherwise `q1` is decreased by 1; `y[i]` is assigned the value of the updated `k`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the updated `k` to `y[i]`. The value of `i` remains either `n-6` or `n-7`, and the conditions for updating `k` and modifying `q1` or `q2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged conditions and the assignment of `y[i]` to the updated `k`.
