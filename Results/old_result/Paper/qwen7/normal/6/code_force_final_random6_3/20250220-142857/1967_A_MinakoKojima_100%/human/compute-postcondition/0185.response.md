Output State: **`i` is 0; `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`**

Explanation: The code calculates the difference between the element at index `i + 1` (which is `a[1]` since `i` is 0) and the element at index `i` (which is `a[0]`). The result of this calculation is assigned to the variable `dif`. The initial value of `i` remains unchanged.
