Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1
- `n` is the original value of `k`
- `res` contains the element `a[1]`

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

Here, `a[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Given that `i` is 1, `a[i]` is equivalent to `a[1]`.

From the initial state, we know that `res` contains the element `a[1]`, which means `a[1]` is the same as the value stored in `res`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `a[1]` (or equivalently, the value of `res`).

Output: **a[1] (or res)**
