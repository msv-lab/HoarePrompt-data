Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an integer read from standard input.
- `k` is an integer read from standard input.
- The condition `n + 2 > 2 * k` holds true.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to evaluate the expression `n - k + 1`.

Given the condition `n + 2 > 2 * k`, we can rearrange it to express `n` in terms of `k`:
\[ n > 2k - 2 \]

This means `n` is at least \(2k - 1\) because `n` must be an integer and satisfy the inequality.

Therefore, the expression `n - k + 1` simplifies to:
\[ n - k + 1 \]

Since `n` is greater than \(2k - 2\), let's consider the minimum value of `n` which is \(2k - 1\):
\[ n - k + 1 = (2k - 1) - k + 1 = k \]

Thus, the value of `n - k + 1` is at least `k`. Given that `n` could be any integer greater than \(2k - 2\), the value of `n - k + 1` will be `k` or more, but the minimum value is `k`.

So, the output of the `print` statement will be the value of `n - k + 1`, which is at least `k`.

Output: **n - k + 1 (where n - k + 1 is at least k)**
