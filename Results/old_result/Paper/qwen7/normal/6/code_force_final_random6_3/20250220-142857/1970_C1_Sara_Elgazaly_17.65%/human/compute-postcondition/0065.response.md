Output State: **`s` is True, `x` is equal to `y`, `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user, `y` is the last element popped from `lst[x]`, and `lst[x]` contains at least one element before the pop operation.**

Explanation: The code `y = lst[x].pop()` pops the last element from the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to the variable `y`. The other variables remain unchanged. `s` is still True, `x` is still equal to `y`, `a` and `b` are still the last two integers entered by the user, and `lst[x]` still contains at least one element before the pop operation.
