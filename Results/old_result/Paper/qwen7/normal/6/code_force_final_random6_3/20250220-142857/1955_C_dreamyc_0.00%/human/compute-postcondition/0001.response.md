Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer not exceeding 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `ans` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
