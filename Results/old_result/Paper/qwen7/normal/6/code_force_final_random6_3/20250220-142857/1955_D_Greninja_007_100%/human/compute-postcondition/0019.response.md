Output State: **`ca[a[r - m]]` is decremented by 1, `sm` is either decremented by 1 or incremented by 1 depending on the condition `ca[a[r - m]]` <= `cb[a[r - m]]`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `sm` compared to `k`.**

Explanation: The code decrements `ca[a[r - m]]` by 1. The value of `sm` is adjusted based on the condition `ca[a[r - m]]` <= `cb[a[r - m]]`. If the condition is true, `sm` is decremented by 1; otherwise, `sm` is incremented by 1. The values of `m`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
