Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is 2.
2. It also states that `len(a)` must be greater than 1, meaning the list `a` has at least 2 elements.

Given these conditions, when the `print(a[i], end='')` statement is executed, it will attempt to access the element at index `i` in the list `a`.

- Since `i` is 2, it will try to access the third element in the list `a` (remember, list indices start from 0).
- Because `len(a)` is greater than 1, the list `a` has at least two elements, so the third element exists.

Therefore, the output will be the third element of the list `a`.

Output: **a[2]**
