Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` must be non-zero, `nums` is a deque of `n-1` integers, `ans` is 0, `a` is the first element of the deque before popping minus `x`, `b` is the last element of the deque before popping, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `b` is decreased by `x`.**

Explanation: The code `b -= x` decreases the value of `b` by `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
