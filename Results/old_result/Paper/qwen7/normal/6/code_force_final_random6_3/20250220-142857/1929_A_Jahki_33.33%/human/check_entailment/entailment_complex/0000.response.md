### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array \(a\) by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array and then compute the difference between consecutive elements after sorting. This is because sorting ensures that the largest possible differences are achieved between consecutive elements.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements.
   - It calls `func_1` but the function is not used in the main logic.
   - The main logic calculates the beauty by sorting the array and computing the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

4. **Sorting and Calculation**:
   - The array is sorted using `b = sorted(a)`.
   - The beauty is calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array: `beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]`.

5. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
   - However, the function is not used in the main logic to calculate the beauty.

6. **Correctness Check**:
   - The main logic correctly sorts the array and calculates the beauty.
   - The function `func_1` is redundant and not necessary for calculating the beauty.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct because it correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting it and computing the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
