Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `A` is an input integer, `B` is an input integer, `C` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `A, B, C = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. The initial conditions for `A'`, `B'`, and `C'` are not directly affected by this input operation, so they remain unchanged in terms of their conditions. The only thing that changes is the assignment of the input values to `A`, `B`, and `C`. The value of `i` is updated to `i_prev + 1` due to the initial state condition.
