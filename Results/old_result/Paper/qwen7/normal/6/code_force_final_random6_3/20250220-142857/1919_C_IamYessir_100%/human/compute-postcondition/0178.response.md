Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` minus 1, `s` is the count of consecutive elements in list `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, and `lit` is a list of integers created from the input.**

Explanation: The code `lit = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and creates a list `lit` from these integers. The initial values of `i` and `s` remain unchanged.
