Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `A'` is replaced by an integer input, `B'` is replaced by an integer input, `C'` is replaced by an integer input.**

Explanation: The code `A, B, C = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. Since the initial state had `A` as `A'`, `B` as `B'`, and `C` as `C'`, these are now replaced by the integer inputs. The variable `i` was initially incremented by 1, so it remains incremented by 1.
