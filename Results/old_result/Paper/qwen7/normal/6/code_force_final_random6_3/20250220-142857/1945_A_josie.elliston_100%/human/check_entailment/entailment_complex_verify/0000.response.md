### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given code and the original assessment. We need to verify if the original assessment is accurate or not.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` aims to determine the minimum number of tents required for a given number of extroverts and universals.
- It checks if `extroverts % 3 != 0` and if `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`. If true, it returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to pair all extroverts with two others.
- Otherwise, it returns `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- The function `func_2` uses `func_1` to determine the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
- If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate all extroverts.
- Otherwise, it adds the result of `func_1` to the number of introverts.

#### Test Case Analysis:
Consider the test case `1 4 1` (1 introvert, 4 extroverts, 1 universal):

1. **Function `func_1(4, 1)`**:
   - `4 % 3 != 0` is true.
   - `4 % 3 + 1 < 3` is false.
   - Therefore, `func_1(4, 1)` returns `ceil((4 + 1) / 3) = 2`.

2. **Function `func_2(1, 4, 1)`**:
   - `func_1(4, 1)` returns `2`.
   - `func_2(1, 4, 1)` returns `1 + 2 = 3`.

The original assessment claims that the output should be `-1` because it's impossible to pair all 4 extroverts with two others. However, let's re-evaluate the logic:

- With 1 universal and 4 extroverts, we can pair 2 extroverts with the universal, and the remaining 2 extroverts can share a tent. This requires 2 tents for the extroverts and 1 tent for the introvert, totaling 3 tents.

Therefore, the current implementation is correct for this specific test case.

#### General Validation:
- The logic in `func_1` ensures that if the number of extroverts cannot be fully paired with universals and other extroverts, it returns `None`.
- The logic in `func_2` correctly handles the case where `func_1` returns `None` by returning `-1`.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is incorrect. The provided code correctly handles the scenario where it's impossible to pair all extroverts with two others.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.
