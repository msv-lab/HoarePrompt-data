Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 998\).
- `n` is the minimum of the original `n` and \(2 * k - 2\), where `k` is an integer read from standard input.

The print statement simply outputs the number `1`.

Since the value of `1` is explicitly stated and does not depend on any other variables or conditions, the output is straightforward.

Output: **1**
