Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer input split from `t`, and `m` is the second integer input split from `t`; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and assigns it to `k`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the specified range, `n` and `m` are the integers split from `t`, and `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
