### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to minimize the penalty by splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s` into subarrays.
   - The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The goal is to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - It calculates the number of `-` characters (`neg`) in the string `s`.
   - It then prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - Let's analyze the logic in `func_1()` more closely:
     - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the formula `n - 2 * neg` is used.
     - If `n` is equal to `neg`, the formula `n` is used.
   - Consider the implications of this formula:
     - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the formula `n - 2 * neg` suggests that the penalty is minimized by considering the balance between positive and negative elements.
     - If `n` is equal to `neg`, the formula `n` suggests that the penalty is simply the length of the string.

4. **Evaluating the Annotations:**
   - The annotation states that the code calculates `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, and `n` otherwise.
   - This matches the logic in the code.
   - However, the annotation does not explain why this formula is correct or how it relates to minimizing the penalty.

5. **Detailed Evaluation:**
   - To minimize the penalty, we need to consider the optimal way to split the array `a` into subarrays.
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` is derived from the observation that the penalty is minimized when the number of positive and negative elements is balanced.
   - When `n` is not equal to `neg`, the penalty is minimized by ensuring that the number of positive and negative elements is as close to equal as possible.
   - When `n` is equal to `neg`, the penalty is simply the length of the string, as there are an equal number of positive and negative elements.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code does not explicitly handle the splitting of the array into subarrays, but it correctly uses the formula `n - 2 * neg` to determine the minimum possible penalty.
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` is indeed correct for minimizing the penalty under the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum possible penalty based on the given formula. Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate in stating that the code does not correctly solve the problem.
