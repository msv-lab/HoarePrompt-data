Output State: **`arr` is an empty list, `i` is the last element of the original `arr`, `c` is equal to the new input value + 2, `ans` is a list with elements as specified and extended by 0s to match the new length of `n`, `n` is an integer obtained from splitting the last element of `l1` and converting it to an integer, `k` is an integer obtained from splitting the second last element of `l1` and converting it to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The line `k0 = k` simply assigns the value of `k` to `k0`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged.
