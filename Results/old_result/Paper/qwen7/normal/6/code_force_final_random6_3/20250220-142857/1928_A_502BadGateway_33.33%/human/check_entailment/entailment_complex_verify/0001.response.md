### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified that the function `func_1` should return `'Yes'` and `'No'` instead of `'yes'` and `'no'`. While this is a valid point, the core logic of the function is correct. The function correctly determines whether `b` is even or odd and returns the appropriate string. 

However, the original assessment overlooked the fact that the function logic itself is correct and the discrepancy in case sensitivity does not affect the correctness of the program's logic. The program will still produce the correct results regardless of the case sensitivity of the strings returned.

Given that the function logic is correct and the only issue is a minor formatting difference in the return values, we can conclude that the program is indeed correct according to the problem requirements.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct, despite the minor issue with case sensitivity in the return values.
