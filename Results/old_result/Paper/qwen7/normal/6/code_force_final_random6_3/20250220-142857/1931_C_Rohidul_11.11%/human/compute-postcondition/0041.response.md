Output State: **`st` is equal to the number of consecutive identical elements at the beginning of the list, `end` is incremented by 1, `l` is the index right after the last pair of identical elements found, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is either `r - l - 1` if the first and last elements are identical and there are consecutive identical elements at the start, or `len(a) - 1` if the first and last elements are not identical, or `n - 1 - l` otherwise, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts each element to an integer, storing the resulting list in `a`. The values of `st`, `end`, `l`, `r`, and `ans` remain unchanged, and a new variable `a` is introduced, which is the list of integers obtained from the input. The value of `n` remains the same as the length of the list `a`.
