Output State: **`segments_variants` is a list containing either `['max_segment + [i - 1]']` or `['new_segment', 'i - 1']`; `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` is updated to either `[0, 0]` if `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` or to `new_segment` if not; `max_sum` remains `-1`; `len(arr)` is at least 1; the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0; `max_segment[0]` is either greater than `new_segment[0]` or equal to `new_segment[0]`.**

Explanation: The line `new_segment = []` assigns an empty list to `new_segment`. This changes the value of `new_segment` from its previous state (which was either `['max_segment + [i - 1]']` or `['new_segment', 'i - 1']`) to an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
