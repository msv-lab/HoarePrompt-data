Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `ans[2]` is 2 (This variable is not directly part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)
   - `x` is `left[1] - a[1] - 1` (This variable is not directly part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)
   - `inx2` is `last[0]` (This variable is not directly part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)
   - `inx` is `last[0]` (This variable is not directly part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop condition is `i < n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 2.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from 2 to 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `i` is 3
- `n` must be greater than 2

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2**
