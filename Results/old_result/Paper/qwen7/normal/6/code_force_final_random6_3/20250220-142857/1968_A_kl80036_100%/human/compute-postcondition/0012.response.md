Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations specified by `t`, `t` must still be within the range 1 to 1000, `x` will be the last input integer processed, and `y` will be `x - 1`.

In more detail, if the loop runs `t` times (where `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`), then `i` will take on values from 0 to `t-1`. The variable `x` will hold the value of the last integer input during the loop's final iteration, and `y` will be `x - 1`. All other variables outside the loop will retain their initial or unchanged states.
