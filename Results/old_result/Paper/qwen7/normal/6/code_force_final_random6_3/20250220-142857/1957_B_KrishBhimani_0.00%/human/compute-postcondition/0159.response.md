Postcondition: `c` is 9, `arr` is a list containing [1, 4, 8], `i` is 8, and `ans` is a list containing [-11, 16, -5]. This is because if `c` equals `n - 1`, then `ans` is updated to include `-5` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, this is the only case considered.
