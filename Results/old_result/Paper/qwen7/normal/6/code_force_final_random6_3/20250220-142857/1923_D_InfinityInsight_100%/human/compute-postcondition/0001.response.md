Output State: **`left` is a list containing 0; `last` is a list containing -1**

Explanation: The initial state has `left` as a list containing 0. The code assigns `[-1]` to the variable `last`. This does not affect the value of `left`. Therefore, `left` remains a list containing 0, and `last` becomes a list containing -1.
