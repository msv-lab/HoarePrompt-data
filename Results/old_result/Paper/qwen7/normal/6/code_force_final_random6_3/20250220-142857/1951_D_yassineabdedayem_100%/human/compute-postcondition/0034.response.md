Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 998\), `n` is the minimum of the original `n` and \(2 * k - 2\), and `k` is an integer read from standard input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and its range is still \(1 \leq t \leq 998\). The new value of `n` is the minimum of the original `n` and \(2 * k - 2\). The value of `k` is the integer read from standard input.
