Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is 3, `ans` is a list with elements `a[n-1] - 1`, `a[n-1] - 2`, `a[n-1] - 3`, `cnt` is `cnt - 3`**.

Explanation: The loop has appended the values `a[n-1] - 1`, `a[n-1] - 2`, and `a[n-1] - 3` to the list `ans` and then the variable `cnt` has been decremented by `adv`, which is 3. Therefore, `cnt` is now `cnt - 3`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, with `i` still being `n` and `j` being `adv`, which is 3.
