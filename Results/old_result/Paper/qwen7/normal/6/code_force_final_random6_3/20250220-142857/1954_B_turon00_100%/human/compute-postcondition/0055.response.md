Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list (i + 1), `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` if the element at index `i` in list `a` is not equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.**

This means that after executing the line `ans = min(ans, cnt)`, the value of `ans` is updated to be the smaller value between its current value and `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states, except that `cnt` might have been updated based on the condition involving `tmp` and the element at index `i` in list `a`.
