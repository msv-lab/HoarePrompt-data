To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop head, which is `i < len(a) - 2`.

Let's break down the given information:

- The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`.
- After the previous iteration, `i` is either 1 or 3.
- `len(a)` is the length of the string `a`, and it is known that `a` has a length greater than 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < len(a) - 2` must still hold true. We need to ensure that `i` is still less than `len(a) - 2` after the adjustment.

Given that `i` is either 1 or 3, let's consider both cases:

1. If `i` is 1:
   - For the loop to continue, `1 < len(a) - 2` must be true.
   - This simplifies to `len(a) > 3`.
   - Since `a` has a length greater than 2, `len(a) > 3` is already satisfied.

2. If `i` is 3:
   - For the loop to continue, `3 < len(a) - 2` must be true.
   - This simplifies to `len(a) > 5`.

Since `i` is either 1 or 3, the critical point is when `i` is 3 because it requires a stricter condition (`len(a) > 5`) compared to when `i` is 1 (`len(a) > 3`).

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `len(a)` must be greater than 5.

No other states need to be adjusted since the loop condition only depends on `i` and `len(a)`.

State: **`i` is either 1 or 3, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with its length greater than 5, `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` (starting from index 0 and having length 3) is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, and `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index 0 and having length 3.**
