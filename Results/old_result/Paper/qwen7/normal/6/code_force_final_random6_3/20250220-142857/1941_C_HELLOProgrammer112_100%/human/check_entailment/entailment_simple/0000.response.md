Reasoning:
- The given program aims to count the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. It incorrectly calculates this by counting the occurrences of 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie'.
- Counting the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' separately and then adding them without considering overlaps (like 'mapie') will lead to double-counting substrings that contain both 'map' and 'pie'. This method does not account for the fact that removing one instance of 'mapie' would suffice to eliminate both 'map' and 'pie' at the same time.
- The formula used (`x + y - z`) assumes that every 'mapie' is counted once for 'map' and once for 'pie', which is not accurate because 'mapie' should only contribute to the count once when calculating the minimum deletions needed.

Given the above reasoning, the program's logic is flawed and will not correctly calculate the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
