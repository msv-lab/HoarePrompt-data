Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list of integers, `ele` is the second element of `l`, `c` is the sum of `c` and the second element of `l`, `maxi` is the maximum between the previous value of `c` and the second element of `l`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `maxi` to be the maximum value between its current value and the second element of the list `l`. The second element of `l` is also stored in `ele`, and `c` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and the second element of `l`. The list `l` and the variable `ele` remain unchanged from their initial states.
