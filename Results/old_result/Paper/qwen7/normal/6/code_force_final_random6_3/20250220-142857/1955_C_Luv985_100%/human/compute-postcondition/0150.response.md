Postcondition: **`mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `l` < `r`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `a[l]` and `a[r]` are each decreased by `mi`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `l` is increased by 1, and `r` is decreased by 1. If `a[r]` equals 0, `r` is also decreased by 1. Otherwise, `t` is `k % 2`, and the values of `mi`, `l`, `r`, `t`, and `ans` remain unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
