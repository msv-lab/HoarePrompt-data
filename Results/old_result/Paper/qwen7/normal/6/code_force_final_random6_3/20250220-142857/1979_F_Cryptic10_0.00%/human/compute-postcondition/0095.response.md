Output State: **`d` is `n-3`, `v` is a vertex, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `v` is reassigned to the return value of `func_1(d)`, and `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`**.

Explanation: The code `v, u = func_1(d)` calls the function `func_1` with the argument `d` (which is `n-3`). The function returns two values, which are assigned to `v` and `u` respectively. Since the exact nature of `func_1` is not specified, we know that `v` is reassigned to the first return value and `u` is reassigned to the second return value. All other variables remain unchanged.
