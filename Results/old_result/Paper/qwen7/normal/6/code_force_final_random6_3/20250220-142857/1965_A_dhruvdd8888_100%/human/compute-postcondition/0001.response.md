Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a set containing the integers split from the input string.**

Explanation: The code `nums = set(input().split())` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts them into a set. Since the input is not specified, the only thing we know for certain is that `nums` now contains the integers from the input string. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
