Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is `t - 2 * n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `res` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to remove elements from the front of the list `a` as long as the first element is 0. Since the loop executes up to 3 times and the conditions given indicate that the first element of `a` was 0 each time, `a` will be emptied after these iterations. The variable `t` decreases by 2 for each iteration of the loop, so after `n` iterations, it will decrease by `2 * n`. The variables `res` and `n` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
while a and a[-1] == 0:
    a.pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `t - 2 * n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` now contains at least one element which is not 0, `res` is 0
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is `t - 2 * n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` now contains at least one element which is not 0 and the last element of `a` is no longer 0, `res` is 0
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` is now one element shorter than before the operation.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
