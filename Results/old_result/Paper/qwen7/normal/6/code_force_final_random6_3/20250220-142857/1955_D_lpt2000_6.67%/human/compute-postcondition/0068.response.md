Postcondition: **`fnd` is increased by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. `tot` is the sum of the values in `D.values()`. `C[in_aa]` is either equal to `C[in_aa] + 1` or greater than 0. `E[out_aa]` is either not decreased at all or decreased by 1. `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1. `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`. `out_aa` is the corresponding element in `aa[:n - m]`. Both `in_aa` and `out_aa` are updated to the next elements in their respective slices. If `E[out_aa] > 0`, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if the `else` part is executed.**
