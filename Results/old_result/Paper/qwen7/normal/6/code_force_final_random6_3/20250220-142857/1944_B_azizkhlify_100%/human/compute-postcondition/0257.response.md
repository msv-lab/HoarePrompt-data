Given the initial state where `i` is `n + 2` and `n` must be at least 3, we can determine the following:

- Since `n` must be at least 3, the smallest possible value for `n` is 3.
- If `n` is 3, then `i` would be `3 + 2 = 5`.
- Therefore, `i` is 5, and we need to print `a[5]`, `a[5]`, with a space as the end character.

Since the exact values of `a[5]` are not provided, we can only describe it in terms of the array `a`.

Output: **a[5] a[5]**
