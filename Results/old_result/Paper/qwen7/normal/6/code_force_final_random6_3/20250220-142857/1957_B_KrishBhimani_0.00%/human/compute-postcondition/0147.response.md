Output State: **`c` is 8, `arr` is a list containing [1, 4, 8], `i` is 1, `ans` is a list with the values [0, -1, 2].**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the value of `1 << i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 1, `1 << 1` equals 2 (since shifting 1 left by 1 bit results in 10 in binary, which is 2 in decimal). The list `ans` originally contains `[0, -1]`, so after appending 2, it becomes `[0, -1, 2]`. The values of `c`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged.
