Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, so `i` equals `n`, which is the length of the original list `a`. The list `a` has been fully processed, meaning it is now empty. The `last` list remains appropriately initialized as it tracks the last occurrence of each unique element in `a` up to each point during the loop's execution. The `left` list contains the cumulative sum of all elements in `a`, with the last element being the sum of all elements in `a`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to the length of the original list `a`, `a` will be an empty list, `last` will track the last index of each unique element seen in `a` during the loop, and `left` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements of `a`, with the final sum being the total of all elements in `a`.
