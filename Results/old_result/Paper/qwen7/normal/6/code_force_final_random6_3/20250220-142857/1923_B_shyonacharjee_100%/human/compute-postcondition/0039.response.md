Output State: **`can_survive` remains False, `bullets_used` is 0, `total_bullets_needed` is `n * health`, `t` is `t - 1`, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element in each tuple, `distance` is `abs(pos)` for the last processed tuple, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The line `bullets_used = 0` sets the value of `bullets_used` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
