Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither, based on the problem description. The conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`) are correctly checked, and the appropriate output is printed for each test case. The program handles multiple test cases as well. Therefore, the given program is correct.
