Output State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, each tuple must have exactly four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and `arr` must have at least one element, `count` is `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `mod_x_key` the value of `num % x`. The value of `num` is not specified, so `mod_x_key` will be the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
