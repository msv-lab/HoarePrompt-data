Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop starts from `n` and goes up to `2 * n - 1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < 2 * n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000
   - `a` is a list of integers
   - The condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` holds true if `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n-1`, the next value of `i` will be `n`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `i` will be incremented from `n-1` to `n`.
- `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- The condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` needs to be checked again for the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `a` is a list of integers, and the condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` holds true if `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2; otherwise, it remains unchanged.**
