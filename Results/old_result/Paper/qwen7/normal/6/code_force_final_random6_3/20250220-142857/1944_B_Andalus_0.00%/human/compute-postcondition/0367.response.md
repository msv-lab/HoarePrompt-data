Postcondition: `ldb` is a non-empty list, and the size of `ldb` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration. If `sz` (the size of `ldb`) is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `sz` is less than `k`, no action is taken and the list `ldb` remains unchanged.
