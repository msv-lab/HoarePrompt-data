Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, who play optimally on an array `a` of size `n`. Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the array `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided does not correctly implement the logic for determining the optimal MEX value for the game between Alice and Bob.
   - The function `func_1` does not consider the turns of Alice and Bob or their strategic choices.
   - The function `func_1` simply counts the frequency of each element in the array and prints the first element that appears exactly once or not at all. This approach does not account for the turns and strategies of the players.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Alice will always pick the smallest available number to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will pick the largest available number to minimize the MEX.
   - The optimal strategy ensures that Alice can always pick the smallest available number, and Bob can pick the largest available number alternately.

4. **Expected Functionality**:
   - The function should simulate the game by alternating between Alice and Bob picking numbers according to their respective strategies.
   - After the game ends, the MEX of the resulting array `c` should be calculated.

Given the provided code does not simulate the game correctly and does not follow the optimal strategy for both players, the given function `func_1` is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
