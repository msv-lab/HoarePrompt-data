Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `range(2, n + 1)`. This means the loop will iterate over values of `i` starting from 2 up to `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `dp` is a list containing `[1, 6]`, and `i` is 3.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `2` to `n` (inclusive). Since `i` is currently 3, the loop will continue if `n` is greater than or equal to 4.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 4. Additionally, since the loop condition depends on `n` being greater than or equal to 4, `n` must be at least 4.

5. **Final state**: After adjusting the states, the new state should reflect `i` being 4 and `n` being at least 4.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`dp` is a list containing [1, 6], `i` is 4, `n` must be at least 4**
