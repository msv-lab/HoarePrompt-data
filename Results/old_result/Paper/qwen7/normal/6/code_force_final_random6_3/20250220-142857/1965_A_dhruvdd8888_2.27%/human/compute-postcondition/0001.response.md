Output State: **`N` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `nums` is a set containing strings from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `nums = set(input().split())` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, and then creates a set from these strings. The set `nums` is created with the elements from the input, while the variable `N` remains unchanged as it was defined in the initial state.
