Output State: **`T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().split()` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `a`. The values of `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
