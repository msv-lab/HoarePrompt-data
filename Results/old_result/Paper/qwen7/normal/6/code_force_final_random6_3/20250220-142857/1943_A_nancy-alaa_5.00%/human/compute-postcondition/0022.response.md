Postcondition: `first` remains False, `i` is either 0 or the next key in `mpp` where `mpp[key] == 1`, and `n` must be greater than 0. If the current value of `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, no changes are made to `i` and `first` remains as is. If `mpp[i]` is equal to 1 and `first` is False, `i` is set to the next key in `mpp` where `mpp[key] == 1`.
