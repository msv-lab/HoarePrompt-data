Output State: `segments_variants` is a list of all valid segments found during the execution of the loop, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum found throughout the entire iteration, and `max_sum` remains -1.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all iterations, `segments_variants` will contain all the segments that were considered as potential candidates for the maximum sum segment. The `new_segment` will be an empty list because it gets reset whenever a new segment is finalized and added to `segments_variants`. `max_segment` will hold the segment with the highest sum encountered during the entire process. Since the loop does not modify `max_sum` unless a new maximum is found, and no new maximum was found in the given conditions, `max_sum` remains -1.
