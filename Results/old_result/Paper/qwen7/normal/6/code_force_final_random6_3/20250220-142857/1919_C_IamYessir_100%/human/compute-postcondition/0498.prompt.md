Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` will be 0, `lit` will remain as the list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` and `b` will be lists whose final states depend on the values of `lit` relative to `x` and `y` throughout the iterations. `cp` will remain 0. If `b` is not empty, `x` will be greater than `y`, otherwise `y` will be positive infinity. `x` will be equal to the last element of list `a` if `len(a) != 0`, otherwise `x` will be set to positive infinity. `b` will contain all elements of `lit` that satisfy the conditions specified within the loop. `s` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `a` is a list with at least one element, and if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 1. If `a[i]` is not greater than `a[i - 1]`, the value of `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `a` is a list with at least one element, and `s` is an integer that has been incremented by 1 if `a[2]` is greater than `a[1]`. If `a[2]` is not greater than `a[1]`, `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `a` is a list with at least one element, and `s` is incremented by 1 if `a[3]` is greater than `a[2]`. If `a[3]` is not greater than `a[2]`, `s` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
