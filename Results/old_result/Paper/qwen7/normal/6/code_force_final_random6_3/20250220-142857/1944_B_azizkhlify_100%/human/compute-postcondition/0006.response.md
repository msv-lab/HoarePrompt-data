Output State: **`re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `k` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `l` is a list of n zeros, `r` is a list of n zeros, `res` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `res = []` initializes an empty list named `res`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `re`, `ul`, `ur`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
