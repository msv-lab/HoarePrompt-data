Output State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `score` is `score + 2 * a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1]`, `steps` remains unchanged, `visited` dictionary remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is decremented by 1, `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1]`**.

The code updates the value of `current_pos` to `p[current_pos - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
