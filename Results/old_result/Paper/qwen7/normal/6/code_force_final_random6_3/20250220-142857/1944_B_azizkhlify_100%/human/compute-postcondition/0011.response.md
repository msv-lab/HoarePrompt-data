Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `re` is 0
   - `ul` is 0
   - `ur` is 0
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000
   - `k` is an integer between 1 and 5000
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces
   - `l` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[1] - 1` incremented by 1
   - `r` is a list of `n` zeros
   - `res` is an empty list
   - `i` is 3

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `range(n)`, the variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 4.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is a constant for the entire loop.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `re` remains 0
   - `ul` remains 0
   - `ur` remains 0
   - `n` remains the same (an integer between 1 and 5000)
   - `k` remains the same (an integer between 1 and 5000)
   - `a` remains the same (a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces)
   - `l` remains the same (a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[1] - 1` incremented by 1)
   - `r` remains the same (a list of `n` zeros)
   - `res` remains the same (an empty list)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `k` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `l` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `a[1] - 1` incremented by 1, `r` is a list of n zeros, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 4**
