Output State: **`win` is an empty set, `us` is a set of integers (unchanged), `ans` is a list containing the elements `i`, `i`, `ps` is 3, `i` is the next element in `s`, `s` is the same set.**

Explanation: The code `win.clear()` clears the set `win`, making it an empty set. The other variables (`us`, `ans`, `ps`, `i`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
