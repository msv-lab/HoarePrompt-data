Output State: **`extroverts` is decreased by the number of universals; `ret` is the return value of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`; `introverts` remains unchanged; and `universals` is used as an argument in `func_1`.**

This means that the function `func_1` is called with the parameters `extroverts` (decreased by the number of `universals`) and `universals`. The return value of `func_1` is stored in `ret`. The values of `introverts` and `universals` remain unchanged from their initial state.
