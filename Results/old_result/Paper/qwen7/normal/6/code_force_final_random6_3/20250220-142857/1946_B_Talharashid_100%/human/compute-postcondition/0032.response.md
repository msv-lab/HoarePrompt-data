To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `c` holds the maximum sum of contiguous subarray elements in the list `l` that meets the condition specified in the loop.
   - `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and any individual element in `l` that is less than 0 and whose absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
   ```

Given the initial state, we need to determine the values of `2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)` and then take the result modulo `1000000007`.

- `2 ** k`: This is simply \(2\) raised to the power of `k`.
- `maxi`: This is the maximum value between `c` and any individual element in `l` that is less than 0 and whose absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`.
- `sum(l)`: This is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.

Since the exact values of `k`, `l`, `c`, and `maxi` are not provided, we can only describe the expression in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007**
