You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

    t = int(input())

        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.

    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        
        n = int(input())
        
        l = input()

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` remains the same as it was initially (an integer between 1 and 5000), `ans_f` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `ans` for each iteration of the loop, and `lst` is an empty list since all elements have been processed according to the conditions inside the loop. The variable `i` is no longer used in the final state but was incremented in each iteration of the loop. The state of `n` is not relevant in the final output state as it is an input for each iteration and gets replaced with new values in each iteration.
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
        
    #State: t is an integer between 1 and 5000, ans_f is a list containing the cumulative sums of ans for each iteration, lst is an empty list, i is the last element of ans_f.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (half the number of elements in the sequence), and a sequence of \( 2n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} \). For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum values of every pair of consecutive integers in the sequence and stores these sums in a list. Finally, it prints each calculated sum. The function does not return any value but modifies a list `ans_f` which contains the results for all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   
2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans_f` to store the answers for each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a variable `ans` to 0 to keep track of the score.
   - It reads the list of integers into `lst` after splitting the input string.

3. **Scoring Mechanism:**
   - The loop runs `n * 2` times, but this is incorrect because it should run `n` times.
   - Inside the loop, it incorrectly attempts to remove elements from `lst` in a way that does not match the problem constraints.
   - Specifically, it tries to remove elements at indices `0 * 2` and `1 * 2`, which is always the same pair of elements and does not correctly simulate the removal of any arbitrary pair of elements each time.

4. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program adds the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` to `ans` and then removes these elements.
   - However, the logic for removing elements is flawed and does not ensure that the minimum elements are always chosen and removed.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the scores stored in `ans_f`.

### Correctness Check:

- The program does not correctly implement the logic to always choose the minimum elements and remove them.
- The loop condition and element removal mechanism are incorrect.
- The program does not handle the problem constraints properly.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
