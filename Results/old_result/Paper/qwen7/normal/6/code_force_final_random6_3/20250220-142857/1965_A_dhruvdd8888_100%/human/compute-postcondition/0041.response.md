Based on the initial state provided:

- `cw` is either `not nw` or `True`. Given that `cw` is explicitly set to `False` later, we can infer that `cw` is `False`.
- `ls` remains the sum of all elements in the list `nums`. This value is not needed for the print statement.
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This value is not needed for the print statement.
- `N` is an input integer. This value is not needed for the print statement.
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). This value is not needed for the print statement.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). This list is not needed for the print statement.
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers. This list is not needed for the print statement.
- `i` is 0. This value is not needed for the print statement.
- `nw` is equal to `cw`, and `cw` is `False`. Therefore, `nw` is also `False`.

The print statement is simply printing the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **'Bob'**
