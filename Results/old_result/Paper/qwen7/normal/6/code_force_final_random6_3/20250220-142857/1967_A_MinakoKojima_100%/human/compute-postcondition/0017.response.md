Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `k` is `k - dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is `ans + dif`, `res` is `res - 1`, and `n` must be at least 1.**

The value of `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, the value of `ans` is increased by `dif`, `res` is decreased by 1, and the conditions for `n` and the difference (`dif`) remain unchanged.
