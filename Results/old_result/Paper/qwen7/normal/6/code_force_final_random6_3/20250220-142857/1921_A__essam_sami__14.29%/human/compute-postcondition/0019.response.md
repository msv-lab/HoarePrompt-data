Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `steps` is 2; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is the first integer entered; `d` is the second integer entered; `e` is the first integer from input split and converted to integer; `f` is the second integer from input split and converted to integer; `g` is the first integer from input split and converted to integer; `h` is the second integer from input split and converted to integer; `x` is (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h); `n` is (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)**.

In this output state, the variables `t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, and `n` retain their initial conditions except for `x`, which is now assigned the value `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`.
