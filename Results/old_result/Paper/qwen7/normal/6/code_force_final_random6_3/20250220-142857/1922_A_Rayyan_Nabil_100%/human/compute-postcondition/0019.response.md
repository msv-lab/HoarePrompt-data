Output State: **`n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `t` is one less than its previous value, `c` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` to the list `results`. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `t` retain their previous values, while `results` now includes the result of the function call. The value of `t` is decreased by 1.
