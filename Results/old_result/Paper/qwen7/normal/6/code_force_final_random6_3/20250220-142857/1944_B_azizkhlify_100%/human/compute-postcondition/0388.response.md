Given the initial state where `i` is 4 and `n` is less than or equal to 3, we need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 4.
- `n` is less than or equal to 3.

However, there is no explicit mention of the list `a` or any other variable that would provide us with the values at index `i` (which is 4). Since the value of `a` is not provided, we cannot determine the actual value of `a[i]`.

Therefore, the output will include the placeholder `[a[i]]` for the value at index 4 of the list `a`.

Output: **[a[4]], [a[4]]**
