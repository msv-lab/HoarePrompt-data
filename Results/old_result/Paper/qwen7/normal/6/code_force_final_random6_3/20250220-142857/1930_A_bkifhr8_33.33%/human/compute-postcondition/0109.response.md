Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
- `ans_f` is a non-empty list containing the cumulative sum of `ans` for each iteration.
- `lst` is an empty list.
- `i` is the first element of `ans_f`.

The print statement `print(i)` will print the value of `i`, which is the first element of the list `ans_f`.

Since `ans_f` is described as a non-empty list containing the cumulative sum of `ans` for each iteration, the first element of `ans_f` would be the cumulative sum up to the first iteration, which is simply the value of `ans` in that first iteration.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `ans` from the first iteration.

Output: **[ans from the first iteration]**
