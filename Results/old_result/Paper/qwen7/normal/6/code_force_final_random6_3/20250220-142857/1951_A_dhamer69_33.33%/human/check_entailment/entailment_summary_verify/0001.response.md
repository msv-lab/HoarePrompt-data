### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided program `func()` is unrelated to the problem description. However, the original assessment could be more detailed in explaining why the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function is correct for its intended purpose.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to create empty files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for each `.html` file in directories whose names are digits within a specified range.

2. **Function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)`**:
   - **Directory Scanning**: The function correctly retrieves the current working directory and scans for subdirectories.
   - **Folder Name Validation**: It filters out only those subdirectories whose names are digits and fall within the specified range.
   - **HTML File Processing**: For each valid directory, it lists all `.html` files and creates two new files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for each `.html` file found.
   - **Main Execution Block**: The function is correctly called with the specified range (`start_range = 1951`, `end_range = 1980`).

Given the function summary, the behavior of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function aligns perfectly with the problem description. The function iterates through the specified range of directories, checks for `.html` files, and generates the required files as expected.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The provided program `generate_files_for_html_in_range` is correct for the problem it is designed to solve.
