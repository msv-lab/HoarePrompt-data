To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop continues.

The loop condition is:
```
while k and len(nums) >= 2:
```

For the loop to continue, both conditions must be true:
1. `k` must be non-zero.
2. The length of `nums` must be at least 2.

Given the current state:
- `t` is a positive integer (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\) (not directly relevant to the loop condition).
- `k` is a non-zero integer.
- `nums` is a deque of `n-1` integers.
- `ans` is either 1 or 2.
- `a` is the first element of the deque before popping.
- `b` is the last element of the deque after appending.
- `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.

The loop body modifies `k` and `b` based on certain conditions, but the key point is that the loop continues as long as `k` is non-zero and `len(nums)` is at least 2.

Since `k` is a non-zero integer and `nums` is a deque of `n-1` integers (which means its length is at least 1), the only way the loop would stop is if `k` becomes zero or `len(nums)` becomes less than 2. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `k` remains non-zero and `len(nums)` is at least 2.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` should remain non-zero.
- `len(nums)` should be at least 2.

State: **`k` is a non-zero integer, `len(nums)` is at least 2**
