Output State: **`d` is `n-1`, `v` is 0, `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` contains all vertices added during the iterations, `remaining_vertices` must contain at least one vertex, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the loop continues with the next iteration.
