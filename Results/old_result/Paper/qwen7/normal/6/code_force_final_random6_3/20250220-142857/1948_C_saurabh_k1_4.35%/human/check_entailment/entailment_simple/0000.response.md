Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Grid Movement**: The function does not simulate the movement of the robot through the grid according to the rules. It simply checks the direction of the arrow at position `n-2` in the second row (`b`) and prints 'No' if the arrow is '<'. This logic is too simplistic and does not account for the robot's movement pattern and the interactions between consecutive arrows.

2. **Missing Simulation of Robot Movement**: The function should simulate the robot moving from the starting position (1,1) and follow the arrows to see if it can reach (2,n). This involves checking both the horizontal and vertical movements as per the problem statement.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The function does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the robot needs to move vertically to the second row and then follow the arrow direction.

Given these issues, the provided function does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
