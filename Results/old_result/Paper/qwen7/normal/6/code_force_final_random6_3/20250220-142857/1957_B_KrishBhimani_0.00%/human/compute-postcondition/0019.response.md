Output State: **`k` is `k` right-shifted by 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `l1` is converted to an integer `n`, `arr` is a list containing the integers `0` and `1`, `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was set to 2, so after executing this line, `i` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
