Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer such that `n > 1`, and the value of `ldb` is a list containing the value of `lft[1]`, and the value of `lft[1]` is equal to the value of `lft[0]`.**

This means that the list `ldb` has been appended with the value of `lft[1]`, which is the same as `lft[0]` due to the initial condition. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
