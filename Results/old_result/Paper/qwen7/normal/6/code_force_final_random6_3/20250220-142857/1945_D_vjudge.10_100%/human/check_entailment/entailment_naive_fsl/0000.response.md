Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly account for the cost of bribing people between the current position and the target position `m`. 

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

### Example Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4 2
  7 3 6 9
  4 3 8 5
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  - According to the problem description, the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first two positions would be calculated as follows:
    - To move from position 3 to position 2: Cost = `b[2] = 3`
    - To move from position 2 to position 1: Cost = `a[1] = 7`
  - Therefore, the total cost should be `3 + 7 = 10`.

- **Actual Output:**
  - Running the provided program with the above input gives an output of `14`, which is incorrect.

### Detailed Explanation:
The issue lies in how the program accumulates the cost. The variable `x` is being incremented by the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each position `i` in reverse order. However, this does not correctly reflect the cost structure described in the problem statement. Specifically, the cost of bribing someone at position `k` (where `j < k < i`) should be added to the total cost only if Kirill moves past that person.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly accumulate the costs based on the described rules. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
    print(pergunta)
```

However, even with this correction, the program still does not fully implement the logic correctly. A more accurate implementation would involve keeping track of the cumulative cost and ensuring that the cost of bribing intermediate people is correctly accounted for.
