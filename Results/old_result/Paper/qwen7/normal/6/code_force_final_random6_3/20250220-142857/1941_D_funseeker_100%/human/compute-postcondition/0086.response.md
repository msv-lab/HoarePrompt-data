Output State: **`c` is a character, `temp` contains the value (q - r) % n added to it, and `q` is the next element in the list `ans`.**

Explanation: The code updates `temp` to contain the value of `(q - r) % n` added to its current value. The value of `c` remains unchanged as it is either '0' or '?', and `q` is still the next element in the list `ans`.
