Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, N is an input integer, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**

Explanation: The code `N = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `N`. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) remains unchanged. For each test case, the precondition that `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and the list of integers \(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\) where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) also remains unchanged. The only new information is that `N` is now set to the integer input.
