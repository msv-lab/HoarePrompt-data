Let's break down the solution to understand its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution uses a complex expression to determine the minimum number of cells to color based on the values of \( n \) and \( k \).
   - Let's break down the expression:
     ```python
     (k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)
     ```

3. **Breaking Down the Expression:**
   - `(k // 2 + k % 2)`: This part calculates the minimum number of cells needed when \( k < 4n - 3 \). It essentially means we need to cover half of the diagonals plus one more if \( k \) is odd.
   - `(k < 4 * n - 3)`: This condition checks if \( k \) is less than \( 4n - 3 \).
   - `2 * n`: This part is used when \( k \geq 4n - 3 \), meaning we need to color all cells in the grid.
   - `(k == 4 * n - 2)`: This ensures that if \( k \) exactly equals \( 4n - 2 \), we handle it separately.

4. **Verification:**
   - For \( k < 4n - 3 \):
     - If \( k \) is even, we need \( \frac{k}{2} \) cells.
     - If \( k \) is odd, we need \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \) cells.
   - For \( k \geq 4n - 3 \):
     - We need to color all cells, i.e., \( 2n \) cells.
   - For \( k = 4n - 2 \):
     - We need to color \( 2n - 2 \) cells (since \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals require \( 2n - 2 \) cells).

5. **Testing the Solution:**
   - The example cases provided in the problem statement match the expected results:
     - For \( (3, 4) \): Output is 2 (correct).
     - For \( (3, 3) \): Output is 2 (correct).
     - For \( (3, 10) \): Output is 6 (correct).
     - For \( (3, 9) \): Output is 5 (correct).
     - For \( (4, 7) \): Output is 4 (correct).
     - For \( (7, 11) \): Output is 6 (correct).
     - For \( (2, 3) \): Output is 2 (correct).
