Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not split the array into optimal parts to minimize the penalty. Instead, it simply counts the number of '-' characters and calculates a penalty based on that count, which does not necessarily yield the minimum penalty.

To solve this problem correctly, the program should consider different ways to split the array and choose the one that results in the minimum total penalty. The current implementation does not explore different splitting strategies and thus cannot guarantee the minimum penalty.
