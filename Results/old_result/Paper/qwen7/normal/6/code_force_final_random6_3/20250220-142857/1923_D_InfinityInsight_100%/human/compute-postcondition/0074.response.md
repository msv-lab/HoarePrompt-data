Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx` is `last[3]`, `inx2` is `last[3]`**

Explanation: The line `inx = inx2` assigns the value of `inx2` to `inx`. Since `inx2` is equal to `last[3]`, `inx` now also holds the value of `last[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
