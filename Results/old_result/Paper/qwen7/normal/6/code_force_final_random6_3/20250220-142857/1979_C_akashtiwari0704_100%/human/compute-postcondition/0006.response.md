Output State: **`g` is updated to the value of `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` will be 1 in the next iteration, `l` must still have at least 1 element.**

This means that the value of `g` has been updated to the result of multiplying its current value by the element `l[i]` at index `i`, and then performing integer division by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`. The value of `i` is set to 1 for the next iteration, and `l` still contains at least one element.
