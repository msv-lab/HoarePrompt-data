Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following objects:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the loop, typically representing the current iteration index.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer. Given the constraints, `t` (which is the input) must be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since the loop depends on the input value `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect that `t` is a positive integer within the given range.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
