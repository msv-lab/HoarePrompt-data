Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `first` is False
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if i not in mpp.keys():
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1:
        first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer, and `n` is an integer greater than 0. If `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` does not equal 1 or `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer (i+1), `n` is an integer greater than 0. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If these conditions are not met, the values of `first`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer (i+1), `n` is an integer greater than 0. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i] != 1` or `first` is false, there is no change in the values of `first`, `i`, and `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
