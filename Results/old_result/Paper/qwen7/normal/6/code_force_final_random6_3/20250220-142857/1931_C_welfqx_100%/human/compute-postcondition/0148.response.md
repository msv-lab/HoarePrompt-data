To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations described:

1. **Incrementing `cn` by `ck`:** This happens after an if-else block execution. The exact conditions under which this happens are not specified, but it means `cn` is updated by adding `ck` to it.

2. **Incrementing `ck`:** This occurs each time `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]` until a pair of consecutive elements are not equal or the end of the list is reached. This means `ck` keeps increasing by 1 as long as consecutive elements in `onum` are the same.

3. **Incrementing `cn` by `ck` if `symb1` equals `symb2`:** This is another condition where `cn` gets incremented by `ck` if `symb1` and `symb2` are equal.

Given these points, we need to understand the values of `n`, `cn`, and `ck` when the print statement is executed.

- **`n`** is explicitly mentioned as an integer, but its value is not provided.
- **`cn`** is incremented by `ck` and possibly by `ck` again if `symb1 == symb2`. Therefore, `cn` is the sum of `ck` plus any additional increments due to `symb1 == symb2`.
- **`ck`** is incremented by 1 each time two consecutive elements in `onum` are the same, up to the point where they are no longer the same or the end of the list is reached.

Since the exact values of `n`, `cn`, and `ck` are not provided, we can only express the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **n - max(cn, ck)**
