Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `ele` and `l`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `l`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.
   - `n` is an input integer (not modified in the loop).
   - `k` is an input integer (not modified in the loop).
   - `c` is updated based on the value of `ele`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 (not relevant for this loop).
   - `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least one element left.
   - `ele` is the next element in the list `l`.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - Since `l` is a list and the loop continues as long as there are elements left, `l` must have at least one element left for the loop to execute again.
   - `ele` will be the next element in the list `l`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `maxi` remains the same as it is not directly affected by the loop itself but rather by the conditions inside the loop.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop.
   - `k` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop.
   - `c` will be updated based on the next element `ele`.
   - `l` must have at least one element left for the loop to execute again.
   - `ele` will be the next element in the list `l`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is updated based on the next element in the list `l`, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least one element left, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`**.
