Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is either 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times (if `n` is odd) or remains unchanged (if `n` is even)**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` is decremented by 1, and the string `s` is defined based on the initial condition. Since the input is taken within the scope of the given code snippet, the value of `n` is updated to the input integer, while `t` is updated to `t - 1`. The value of `s` remains as per the initial condition based on the value of `n`.
