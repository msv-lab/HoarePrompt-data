You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is 0, `nums` is an empty deque, `ans` is the total number of times `b` was found to be non-positive during the loop's execution.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues as long as `k` is non-zero and there are at least 2 elements in `nums`. Each iteration reduces `k` by a value depending on the minimum of the first and last elements of `nums`, and updates `nums` accordingly. Once `k` becomes zero or `nums` has less than 2 elements, the loop terminates. The variable `ans` keeps track of how many times `b` (the last element of `nums` before it is possibly appended back) was found to be non-positive, which happens when `b` is reduced to 0 or less during the loop's execution. Since the loop ends when `k` is 0 or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements, `k` will be 0 and `nums` will be an empty deque by the end of all iterations.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns the total number of times `b` was found to be non-positive during the loop's execution plus 1.
    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is 0, `nums` is an empty deque, and the length of `nums` is at least 2
    return ans
    #The program returns ans, which is currently 0 since no operations have been performed to change its value.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the attack sequence of the Kraken. Specifically, the program uses a `deque` to manage the ships' durabilities but does not accurately reflect the alternating pattern of attacking the first and last ships. Instead, it attempts to reduce the durabilities of both the first and last ships simultaneously in each iteration, which is not consistent with the problem description.

For example, consider the following input:
- `n = 4`, `k = 5`
- Durabilities: `a = [1, 2, 4, 3]`

According to the problem description:
1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, reducing its durability to 0, and the array becomes `[2, 4, 3]`.
2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, reducing its durability to 2, and the array becomes `[2, 4, 2]`.
3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, reducing its durability to 1, and the array becomes `[1, 4, 2]`.
4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, reducing its durability to 1, and the array becomes `[1, 4, 1]`.
5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, reducing its durability to 0, and the array becomes `[4, 1]`.

However, the provided program incorrectly handles the reduction of durabilities. It tries to reduce both the first and last ships' durabilities in each iteration, which leads to incorrect results. For instance, in the third iteration, instead of reducing the first ship's durability to 1, it might reduce it further, leading to an incorrect final state.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly alternate between attacking the first and last ships in each iteration, ensuring that once a ship's durability reaches 0, it is no longer subject to further attacks.
