Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Variables in the Loop Head
The loop head condition is:
```python
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
```
This means the loop will continue as long as the second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

### Step 2: Determine the Initial State of Variables
- `i` is `d-4` + 2.
- `d` must be greater than 1.
- `len(row)` must be greater than `d-1`.
- `min_heap` contains a new tuple where the first element is `row[d-4]` and the second element is `-5` or less.

### Step 3: Analyze the Condition for the First Iteration
For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `(e[1] := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` must be true.

Given:
- `i = d - 4 + 2 = d - 2`.
- The tuple in `min_heap` has the form `(row[d-4], -5)`, where the second element is `-5`.

So, the condition becomes:
```python
-5 <= (d - 2) - (d + 2)
```

Simplifying the inequality:
```python
-5 <= d - 2 - d - 2
-5 <= -4
```

This inequality is always true, meaning the condition will always be satisfied regardless of the value of `d` (as long as `d > 1`).

### Step 4: Check if Any Adjustments are Needed
Since the condition is always true given the constraints, no adjustments are necessary to make the loop execute the first time.

### Conclusion
No changes are needed to the initial state for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `d-4` + 2, `d` must be greater than 1, `len(row)` must be greater than `d-1`, and `min_heap` contains a new tuple where the first element is `row[d-4]` and the second element is `-5` or less**
