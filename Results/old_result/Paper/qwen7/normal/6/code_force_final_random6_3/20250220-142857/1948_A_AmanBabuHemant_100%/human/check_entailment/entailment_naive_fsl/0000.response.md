Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `n` is odd correctly. According to the problem description, if `n` is odd, the output should be 'NO'. However, the program prints 'YES' and a string for any odd `n`, which violates the problem description. For example, if `n = 1`, the program will output:

```
YES
AA
```

This is incorrect because `n` is odd, and the correct output should be 'NO'.
