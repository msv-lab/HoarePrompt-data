Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1, `k` remains unchanged, `nums` is a deque with two fewer elements.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The conditions related to `k` and `nums` (whether `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x` and the changes to `nums`) are not directly impacted by this line of code. Therefore, `k` remains unchanged and `nums` is still a deque with two fewer elements.
