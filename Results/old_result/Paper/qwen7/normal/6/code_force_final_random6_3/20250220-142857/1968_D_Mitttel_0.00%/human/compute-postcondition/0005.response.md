Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, `results` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This operation does not affect the values of `index` or `t`. Therefore, the values of `index` and `t` remain unchanged, and `results` is now an empty list.
