Output State: **`ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`, `res` has not been decreased by 1, and `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`**.

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `k // (i + 1)` to its current value, while the values of `res` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
