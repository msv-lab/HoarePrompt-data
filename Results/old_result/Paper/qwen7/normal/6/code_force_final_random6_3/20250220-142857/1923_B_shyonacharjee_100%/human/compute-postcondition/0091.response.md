Postcondition: `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`; if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, then `can_survive` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `total_bullets_needed` is not greater than `distance * k`, then no changes are made to `can_survive`.
