Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes values for t, n, and k where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers within specific ranges (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2). It returns a result based on these values.**

This means the function indirectly accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`, with specified constraints, and returns a result based on these parameters.
