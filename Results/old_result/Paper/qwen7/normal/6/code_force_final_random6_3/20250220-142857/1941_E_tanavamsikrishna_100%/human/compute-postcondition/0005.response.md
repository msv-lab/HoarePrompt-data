Output State: **`total_costs` is now a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements from the `costs` list, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the sum of the sublist of `costs` starting from index `i` (which is initially 0) and having a length of `k` to the `total_costs` list. After appending, `i` remains unchanged at 0. The initial state of `total_costs` being an empty list means it will now contain one element, which is the sum of the first `k` elements of the `costs` list.
