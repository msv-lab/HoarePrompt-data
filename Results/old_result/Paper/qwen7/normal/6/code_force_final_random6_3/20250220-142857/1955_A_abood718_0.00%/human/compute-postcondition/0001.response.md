Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `A` is the first integer entered, `B` is the second integer entered, and `C` is the third integer entered.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation.
