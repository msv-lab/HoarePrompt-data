Output State: `segments_variants` contains a list of segments; `new_segment` is still an empty list; `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum found throughout the entire iteration; `max_sum` remains -1; `total_max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum among all segments in `segments_variants`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `segments_variants` will contain all the segments generated during the loop's execution. The variable `new_segment` remains an empty list as it is only used within the loop and not modified outside of it. `max_segment` keeps track of the segment with the highest sum encountered during the loop. Since `max_sum` is initialized to -1 and never changed within the loop, it remains -1. Finally, `total_max_segment` is updated to be the segment with the highest sum among all segments in `segments_variants` after all iterations of the loop have completed.
