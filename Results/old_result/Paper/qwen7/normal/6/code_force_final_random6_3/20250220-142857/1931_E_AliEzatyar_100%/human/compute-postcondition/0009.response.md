Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `counter` is either 1 or 0.
   - `num` is a non-empty string or integer.
   - `i` is `len(num) - 1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from `len(num) - 1` to 0 (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `i`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop condition depends on `i`, we need to adjust the value of `i` for the next iteration.
   - Initially, `i` is `len(num) - 1`.
   - After the first iteration, `i` is decremented by 1, so it becomes `len(num) - 2`.

5. **Post-Iteration States:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be `len(num) - 2`.

6. **Other States:**
   - The states of `counter` and `num` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since no modifications are specified in the problem, they stay the same.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` should be `len(num) - 2`.

Thus, the updated state is:

**State: **`counter` is either 1 or 0, `num` is a non-empty string or integer, `i` is `len(num) - 2`**.
