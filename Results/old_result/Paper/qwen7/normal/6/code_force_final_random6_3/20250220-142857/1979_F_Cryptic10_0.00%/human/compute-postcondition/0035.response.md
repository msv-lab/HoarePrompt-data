Output State: **The final state of the loop will be such that `path` contains all vertices added during the iterations, with each vertex being added from the highest index `d` down to 0. The `remaining_vertices` list will be empty since every vertex that was present initially has been removed from it and added to `path`. The value of `d` will be -1 after the loop completes, as the loop iterates over `range(n - 1, -1, -1)` and decrements `d` in each iteration until it reaches -1.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `path` will contain all the vertices that were originally in `remaining_vertices`, listed in the order they were added (from the highest index down to the lowest). The `remaining_vertices` list will be empty because all its elements have been moved to `path`. The variable `d` will be -1, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
