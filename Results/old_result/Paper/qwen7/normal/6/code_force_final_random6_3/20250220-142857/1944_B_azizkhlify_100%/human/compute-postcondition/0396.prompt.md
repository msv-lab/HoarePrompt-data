Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has executed up to the third iteration, `i` is set to the third element in `res`, and `res` contains at least three elements. The `print` function will output the elements of `res` separated by spaces. The condition `ul != ur` is true.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        r[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is less than or equal to 3, `a[3]` exists and its value is used to index `r`, the element at that index in `r` is now 0, and `ur` is 2. If `ul` equals `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited; otherwise, no additional changes occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 4, `n` is less than or equal to 3, and if `ul` equals `ur`, then either no change is made to the variables, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 4, `n` is less than or equal to 3, and if `ul` equals `ur`, then the condition remains unchanged; otherwise, the condition also remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
