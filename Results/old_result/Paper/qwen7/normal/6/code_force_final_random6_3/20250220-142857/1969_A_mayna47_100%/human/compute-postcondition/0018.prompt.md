Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `p` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct, `v` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0 except for the first element which is 0 and the rest are converted from the input split and mapped to integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if v[v[i]] == i:
        print(2)
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i`. If `v[v[i]]` equals `i`, the program does not change the values of `i` or `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `v[v[3]]` is not equal to 3. If `v[v[3]]` equals 3, the function returns None. Otherwise, the function does not change the values of `i` and `n`, and `v[v[3]]` remains not equal to 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
