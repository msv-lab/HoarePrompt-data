Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to the number of elements in `sng`, `rdb` will be an empty list, and `sz` will be equal to the number of elements in `sng`.**

Explanation: The loop continues to print each element of `sng` and increment `sz` until `sz` is no longer less than `k` or there are no more elements in `sng`. Since the loop breaks when `sz` is no longer less than `k` or when it has iterated through all elements of `sng`, `sz` will end up being equal to the number of elements in `sng`. The value of `i` will be equal to the number of elements in `sng` because the loop increments `i` with each iteration, and it runs as long as there are elements left in `sng`. The variable `rdb` remains an empty list as it is not affected by the loop.
