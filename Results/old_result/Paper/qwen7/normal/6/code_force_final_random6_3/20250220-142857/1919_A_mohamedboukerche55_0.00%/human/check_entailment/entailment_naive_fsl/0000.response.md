Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints 'bob' or 'alice' accordingly. However, this approach does not account for the game's rules, which involve players taking turns and removing coins until one player cannot make a valid move.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input: `1 1`
- Expected Output: `Bob`

According to the game rules, if Alice starts with 1 coin and Bob also has 1 coin, Alice will lose because she cannot make a valid move after removing her last coin. However, the provided program incorrectly outputs "alice".

The program should simulate the game according to the rules, but instead, it makes a simple parity check, which is not sufficient to determine the winner. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
