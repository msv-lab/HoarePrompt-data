Output State: **`a` is the element at index `x` in list `l`, `b` is infinity, `c` is either 2 or 1, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `x` is `n-1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the element at index `x` in list `l` to variable `a`. Since `a` was initially infinity, it now holds the value of the element at index `x` in `l`. The values of `b`, `c`, `l`, and `x` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
