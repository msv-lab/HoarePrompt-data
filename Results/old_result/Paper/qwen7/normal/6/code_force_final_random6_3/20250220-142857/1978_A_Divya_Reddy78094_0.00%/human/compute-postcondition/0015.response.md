Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `t` is `t + 1` (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(nums[0] + nums[1])`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Since `nums` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, the first element (`nums[0]`) is the largest integer in the list, and the second element (`nums[1]`) is the second largest integer in the list.
2. The print statement adds these two largest integers together.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of the largest and second-largest integers in the `nums` list.

Output: **the sum of the largest and second-largest integers in the `nums` list**
