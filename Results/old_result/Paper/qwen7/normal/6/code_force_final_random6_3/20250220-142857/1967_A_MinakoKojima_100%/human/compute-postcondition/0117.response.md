Output State: **`k` is 0, `ans` is increased by `0 // (i + 1)`, and `res` is now `0 % (i + 1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `k`, `ans`, and `res`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block. Since `k` is 0, `k // (i + 1)` is also 0, and `k % (i + 1)` is 0. Therefore, `ans` remains unchanged, and `res` remains 0.
