Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key variables here are the input value, which determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `arr` is a list containing at least one element.
   - `i` is the last element of `arr`.
   - `c` is equal to `n` + 2.
   - `ans` is a list with specific elements and is extended to match the length of `n`.

3. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs for an integer input value, which means the loop will execute again if the input is greater than 0.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - The input value determines the number of iterations, so it needs to be adjusted.
   - Since `i` is the last element of `arr`, and `arr` remains unchanged within the loop, `i` does not change.
   - `c` is derived from `n`, which is determined by the input, so `c` will change based on the new input.
   - `ans` will be extended by 0s to match the new length of `n`, but its values will depend on the new input.

5. **New Input Value**: Let's assume the input value for the next iteration is `k`. This means the loop will run `k` more times.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- The input value (`int(input())`), which determines the number of additional iterations.
- The length of `ans`, which will be extended by `k` zeros.
- The value of `c`, which will be `n + 2`, where `n` is now the new input value minus 1 (since the loop starts from 0).

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `c` is equal to the new input value + 2, `ans` is a list with elements as specified and extended by 0s to match the new length of `n`, and the new input value is used to determine the number of iterations.**
