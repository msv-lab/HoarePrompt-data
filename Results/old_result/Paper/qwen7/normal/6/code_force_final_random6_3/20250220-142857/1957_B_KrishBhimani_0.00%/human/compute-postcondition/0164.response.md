Output State: `c` is 12, `arr` is a list containing [1, 4, 8], `i` is 8, `ans` is a list containing [-11, 16, -5, 256, -32769, 65536].

Explanation: The loop will continue to execute until `c` equals `n - 1`, which is 7 in this case. Given that `c` is currently 10 after 3 iterations, it will take 2 more iterations to reach `c` = 12. During these iterations, `i` will cycle through the list `arr` again, starting from the last value, 8. For each iteration, `ans` will append a new value calculated as `1 << i`. Therefore, after the next two iterations, `ans` will contain the values [-11, 16, -5, 256, -32769, 65536].
