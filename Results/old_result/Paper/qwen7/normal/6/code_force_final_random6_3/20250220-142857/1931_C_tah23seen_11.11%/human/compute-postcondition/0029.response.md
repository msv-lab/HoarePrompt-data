The loop condition is `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`. For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must be true at the start of the next iteration.

Let's break down the current state and what needs to be adjusted:

- `i` is less than `j`: This is a condition that ensures `i` does not exceed `j`, but it does not affect the loop condition directly.
- `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`: This is the condition that needs to be maintained for the loop to continue.
- `i` is increased by 1: After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following must be true at the start of the next iteration:
- `arr[i]` must still be equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
- `i` must be less than `j` after the increment.

Since `i` is increased by 1, the new condition for the loop to continue will be `arr[i + 1]` (which is now `arr[i + 2]`) equal to `arr[i + 2 + 1]` (which is now `arr[i + 3]`). However, the loop condition itself only checks the equality of `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `arr[i]` is still equal to `arr[i + 1]` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]` and `i` is less than `j - 1`**
