Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer + 1, `s` is an updated input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`, `y` is the count of 'pie' in `s`.**

Explanation: The code `y = s.count('pie')` counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s` and assigns the result to the variable `y`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
