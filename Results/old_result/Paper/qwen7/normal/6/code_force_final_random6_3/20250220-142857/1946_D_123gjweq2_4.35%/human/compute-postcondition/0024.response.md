Postcondition: `xor` is the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr`, `new_arr` contains the previous elements plus the value of 0, and `cur_arr` must contain at least two elements. If `xor` shifted right by `bit` and bitwise AND with 1 equals 0 (i.e., the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0), then `xor` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `xor` remains unchanged as well since there is no else part.
