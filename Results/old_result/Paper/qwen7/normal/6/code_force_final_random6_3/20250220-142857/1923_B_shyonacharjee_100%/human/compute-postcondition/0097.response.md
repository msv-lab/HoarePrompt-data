Output State: **`bullets_used` is `health` more than its original value, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is now `bullets_used + health`, `can_survive` is `False`, `pos` is the position of the next monster in the list, `health` is the health of the next monster in the list and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or the most internal if statement. All the variables retain their previous values as specified in the initial state.
