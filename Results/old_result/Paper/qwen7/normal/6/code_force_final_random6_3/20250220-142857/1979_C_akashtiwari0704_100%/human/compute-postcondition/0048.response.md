Output State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0]) * l[3] // gcd(g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0]), l[3])`, `i` is 3, `l` has more than one element**.

Explanation: Initially, `g` is updated to `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0]) * l[i] // gcd(g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0]), l[i])`. Given `i` is 3, `g` is further updated to `g * l[3] // gcd(g, l[3])`. The length condition `len(l) > 1` remains valid. Therefore, the final state of `g` is the result of the second update, and `i` remains 3.
