Postcondition: `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `h` is an input integer, and `m` is an input integer. If `h` is 0, then `h` remains 0 and `day` remains 'AM'. Otherwise, if `h` is greater than 12, then `h` is set to `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is not greater than 12, then if `h` equals 12, `day` is set to 'AM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'PM'.
