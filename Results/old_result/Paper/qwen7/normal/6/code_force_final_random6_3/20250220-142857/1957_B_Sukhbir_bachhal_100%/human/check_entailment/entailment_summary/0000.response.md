Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to construct a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers such that their sum equals \( k \), and the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR is maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It then constructs a sequence based on the value of \( n \):
     - If \( n > 1 \), it uses a specific strategy to construct the sequence.
     - If \( n = 1 \), it simply prints \( k \).

3. **Constructing the Sequence**:
   - When \( n > 1 \):
     - It calls `func_1(k)` to get the highest bit position where the binary representation of \( k \) has a 1.
     - It appends \( 2^{\text{position}} - 1 \) to the array, which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position.
     - It then appends \( k - (2^{\text{position}} - 1) \) to ensure the sum is \( k \).
     - It fills the rest of the array with zeros to make the total length \( n \).
   - When \( n = 1 \):
     - It simply prints \( k \).

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the highest bit position with a 1 in the binary representation of \( k \).
   - It performs right shifts until \( k \) becomes 0, counting the number of shifts, and then returns the count minus one.

5. **Checking the Execution Summary**:
   - The execution summary states that the function `func_1` correctly returns 31 when called with any \( n \neq 0 \). This is because the highest bit position in any number \( k \) (where \( 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 \)) is at most 30 (since \( 2^{30} = 1073741824 \) is the largest power of 2 less than \( 10^9 \)).

6. **Validation**:
   - The constructed sequence ensures that the sum is \( k \).
   - The bitwise OR of the sequence will have the maximum number of 1s possible given the constraints.

Based on the above analysis, the given program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
