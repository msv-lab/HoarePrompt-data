Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged, and the only affected variable is `n`, which now holds the integer value of the user's input.
