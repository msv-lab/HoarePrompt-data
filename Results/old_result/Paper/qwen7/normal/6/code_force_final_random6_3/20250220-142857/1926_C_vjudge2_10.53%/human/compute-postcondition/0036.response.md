Output State: **`total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `i` is 10, `word` is '10', `last` is 0, `remainder` is 1, `sum_total` is 0, `sum_values[10]` is 0**

Explanation: The code `sum_values[i] = sum_total` updates the element at index `i` of the list `sum_values` to the value of `sum_total`. Given that `i` is 10 and `sum_total` is 0, `sum_values[10]` is set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
