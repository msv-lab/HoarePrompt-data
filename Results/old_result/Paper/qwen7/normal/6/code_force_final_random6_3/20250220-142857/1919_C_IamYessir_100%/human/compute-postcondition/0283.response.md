Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of list `b`, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`. If `len(a)` is 0, then `x` and `y` are both infinity. If `len(a)` is not 0 and `x` is greater than `y`, then `i` is incremented by 1, `b` has an additional element which is the same as `lit[i]`, and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `x` is equal to `y`, `b` has an additional element `b[i]` appended to it; otherwise, `a` is updated by appending `b[i]` to it.
