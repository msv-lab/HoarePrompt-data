Output State: **`i` is less than `n * 2`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and the first element of `lst` is removed.**

Explanation: The code `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` removes the element at index `0 * 2`, which is the same as index `0`, from the list `lst`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still less than `n * 2`, `ans` is still increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and the first element of `lst` has been removed.
