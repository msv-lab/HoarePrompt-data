Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable directly involved in the loop head is `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t > 0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 998\).

3. **Determine the new state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is decremented by 1 each iteration (though the exact decrement is not shown, it is implied by the structure of the `range` function), at the start of the next iteration, `t` will be `t - 1`.

Given that `t` was an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 998\) at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` will be `t - 1`.

Since `n` and `k` are not directly involved in the loop head, their values remain unchanged.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 998\), `n` is an integer equal to the minimum of `n` and `2 * k - 2\), and `k` is an integer read from standard input**.
