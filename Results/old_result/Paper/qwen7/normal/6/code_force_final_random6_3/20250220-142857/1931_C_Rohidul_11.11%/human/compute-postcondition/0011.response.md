Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
   - This means the loop continues as long as `l` is less than `r` and the elements at indices `l` and `l + 1` in the array `a` are equal.

2. **Current States**:
   - `st` is 2
   - `end` is 0
   - `l` is 2
   - `a[0] == a[1]`

3. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables involved in the loop head are `l` and `r`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, both parts of the loop condition must be satisfied.
   - Currently, `l` is 2. For the loop to continue, `l` must be less than `r`.
   - Additionally, `a[l] == a[l + 1]` must hold true for the next iteration. Since `l` is 2, `a[2] == a[3]` must be true.

5. **Ensuring `l < r`**:
   - We need to ensure that `r` is greater than `l`. Since `l` is currently 2, `r` must be greater than 2.

6. **Ensuring `a[l] == a[l + 1]`**:
   - We need to ensure that `a[2] == a[3]` holds true for the next iteration.

### Final State Adjustment:

- Adjust `r` to be greater than 2.
- Ensure `a[2] == a[3]` holds true.

### Final Answer:

State: **`st` is 2, `end` is 0, `l` is 2, `r` must be greater than 2, and `a[2] == a[3]`**
