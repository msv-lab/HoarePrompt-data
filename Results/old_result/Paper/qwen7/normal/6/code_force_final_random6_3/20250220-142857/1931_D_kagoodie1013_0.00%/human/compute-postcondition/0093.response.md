Output State: **`count` is the sum of `mod_x_map.get(x, 0)` plus `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` plus the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` for each iteration, plus the total number of iterations (which is the length of `arr`), `n` is the next value of the first element in `test_cases`, `x` is the next value of the second element in `test_cases`, `y` is the next value of the third element in `test_cases`, `arr` is the next value of the fourth element in `test_cases` and must have all its elements processed, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary where each key is `num % y` for each element in `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that remainder appears, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary where each key is `-num % x` for each element in `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that remainder appears, `num` is the last element of `arr` that was processed, and `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(count)` appends the final value of `count` to the list `results`. This means that `results` now contains one element, which is the accumulated `count` value after processing all elements in `arr`. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
