Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is the minimum value between its initial value (which was `n`) and `cnt`, where `cnt` is 0. Therefore, `ans` is `n`.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `n` remains the same as the initial input.
- `a` remains the same as the initial input list of integers.
- `tmp` remains the same as the first element of the list `a`.
- `cnt` is 0.
- Either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`.

The `print(-1)` statement will simply print the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
