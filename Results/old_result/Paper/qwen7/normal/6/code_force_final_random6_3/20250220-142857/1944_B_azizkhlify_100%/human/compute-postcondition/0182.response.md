Output State: **`i` is `2 * n + 1`, `l[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0**.

Explanation: The code `l[a[i] - 1] = 0` sets the element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` to 0. Since `i` is `2 * n + 1`, `a[i]` would be `a[2 * n + 1]`, and thus `l[a[i] - 1]` becomes `l[a[2 * n + 1] - 1]`. The initial state of `i` and `n` remains unchanged, and now `l[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0.
