Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `n` is the integer input from the user.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer within the specified range.
