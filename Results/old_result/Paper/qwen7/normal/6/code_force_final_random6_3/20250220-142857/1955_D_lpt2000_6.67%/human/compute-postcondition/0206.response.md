Postcondition: **`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. `C[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `D[in_aa]` and `D[out_aa]` maintain their constraints based on the values of `C[in_aa]` and `E[in_aa]`, `E[in_aa]` and `E[out_aa]` are adjusted accordingly, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and `D[out_aa]` is also decreased by 1 while `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1 if `D[out_aa] > 0`. If `D[out_aa] <= 0`, `E[out_aa]` is simply decreased by 1.**

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. It includes the conditions under which `fnd` is incremented and the specific operations performed on the other variables regardless of whether the if condition is true or false.
