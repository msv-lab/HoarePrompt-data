Output State: **`l` is equal to `l` + 1, `r` remains unchanged, `k` is equal to `k - a[l] * 2`, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, and `sunks` is increased by 1, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move directly to the next iteration. Since no further operations are specified within the loop after the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain as they were before the statement was executed.
