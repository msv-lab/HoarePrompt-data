Output State: **`mx` is 6, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is at least 15, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values 6 and 4, `i` is 4**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 4) to the list `subseq_lens`. Initially, `subseq_lens` contains the value 6. After appending 4, `subseq_lens` now contains both 6 and 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
