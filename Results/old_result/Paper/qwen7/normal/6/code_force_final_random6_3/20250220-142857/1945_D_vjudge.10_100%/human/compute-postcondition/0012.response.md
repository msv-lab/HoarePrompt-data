Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `pergunta` is the minimum between the current value of `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`, `x` is `x + min(a[i], b[i])`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `x += min(a[i], b[i])` updates the value of `x` by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`. The values of `i`, `pergunta`, and the conditions for updating them remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still `n-2`, `pergunta` is still the minimum between its current value and `x + a[i]`, and `x` is updated to `x + min(a[i], b[i])`.
