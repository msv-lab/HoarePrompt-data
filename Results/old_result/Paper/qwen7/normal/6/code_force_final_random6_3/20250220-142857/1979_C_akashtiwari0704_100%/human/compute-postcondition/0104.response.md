Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0; `i` is either `N + 1` or `2 * N + 1`; `sumo` is increased by `int(a[i])`; `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i]` to `prod // a[i]`. The other variables (`bets`, `i`, `sumo`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their conditions and values remain the same as in the initial state.
