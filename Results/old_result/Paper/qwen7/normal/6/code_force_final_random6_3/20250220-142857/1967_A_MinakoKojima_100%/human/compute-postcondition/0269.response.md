Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `a` and the object `ans_list`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `ans_list` has at least one element. This means that at the start of each iteration, `a` will be set to the next element in `ans_list`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans_list` must have at least one element.
   - `a` is the first element of `ans_list`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `a` is the first element of `ans_list` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `a` must be set to the second element of `ans_list`.
   - `ans_list` must still have at least one element left after removing the first element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `ans_list` must have at least two elements (since the first element has been used).
- `a` will be the second element of `ans_list`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`ans_list` must have at least two elements, `a` is the second element of `ans_list`**
