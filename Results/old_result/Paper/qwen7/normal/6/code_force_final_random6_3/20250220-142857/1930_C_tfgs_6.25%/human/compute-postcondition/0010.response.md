Output State: **`counter` is a Counter object with elements {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, ..., n: 1}; `i` is `n-1`; `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` equals `1 + (i + 1)` for `0 â‰¤ i < n`.**

Explanation: The `Counter` function counts the occurrences of each element in the list `a`. Since each element in `a` is unique and appears exactly once, the `Counter` object will have each element from `1` to `n` with a count of `1`. The value of `i` remains `n-1` after the loop completes. The list `a` is unchanged and still contains the sequence `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
