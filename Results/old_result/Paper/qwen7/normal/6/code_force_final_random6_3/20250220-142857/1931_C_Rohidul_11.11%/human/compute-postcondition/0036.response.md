Postcondition: `ans` is the length of the list minus one, `st` is equal to the number of consecutive identical elements at the beginning of the list, `end` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `l` is the index right after the last pair of identical elements found, and `r` is `n - 1`. If `st` is 0 and `end` is 0 and the first element of the list is not equal to the last element, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `n - 1 - l`.
