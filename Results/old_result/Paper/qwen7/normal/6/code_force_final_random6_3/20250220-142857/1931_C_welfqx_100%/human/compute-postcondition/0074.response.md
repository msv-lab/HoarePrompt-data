Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `ii` is set to `n - 2`.
   - `n` is a value such that the loop runs `n - 1` times.
   - `cn` is the count of consecutive identical elements starting from the beginning of the list `num` up to index `n-2` plus the count of consecutive identical elements encountered during the loop execution (`ck`).
   - `num` is a list.
   - `ck` holds the count of consecutive identical elements encountered during the loop execution, and it is incremented each time two consecutive elements in `num` are found to be identical until a pair of non-identical elements is encountered or the end of the list is reached.
   - `symb1` and `symb2` are equal.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs `n - 1` times, incrementing `ck` each time two consecutive elements in `num` are identical.
   - `cn` is the sum of the initial count of consecutive identical elements (up to index `n-2`) and `ck`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(n - max(cn, ck))`.
   - To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the values of `n`, `cn`, and `ck`.

4. **Determining Values:**
   - Since `n` is a value that makes the loop run `n - 1` times, `n` must be at least 2 (because if `n` were 1, the loop wouldn't run at all).
   - `cn` is the sum of the initial count of consecutive identical elements (up to index `n-2`) and `ck`.
   - `ck` is the count of consecutive identical elements encountered during the loop execution.

5. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If there are no consecutive identical elements in `num` (or the initial segment up to `n-2`), then `cn` and `ck` would both be 0, so `max(cn, ck)` would be 0.
   - If there are consecutive identical elements, `cn` and `ck` would be greater than 0, and `max(cn, ck)` would be the larger of the two.

6. **Final Calculation:**
   - Regardless of the specific values of `cn` and `ck`, the expression `n - max(cn, ck)` will always be `n - 0` because `max(cn, ck)` cannot exceed `n - 1` (since the loop runs `n - 1` times).

Therefore, the print statement will output `n - 0`, which simplifies to `n`.

Output: **n**
