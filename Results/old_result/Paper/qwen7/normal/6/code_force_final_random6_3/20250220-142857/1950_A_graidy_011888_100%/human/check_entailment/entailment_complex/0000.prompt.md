Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, i is equal to n-1, a, b, and c are integers entered by the user during the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\)). For each test case, if the integer \(t\) (which is read at the beginning and is the number of test cases) is within the range 1 to 1000, the function checks the relationship between \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). It then prints 'STAIR' if \(a < b < c\), 'PEAK' if \(a < b\) and \(b > c\), and 'NONE' otherwise. If \(t\) is outside the specified range, the function skips the test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
