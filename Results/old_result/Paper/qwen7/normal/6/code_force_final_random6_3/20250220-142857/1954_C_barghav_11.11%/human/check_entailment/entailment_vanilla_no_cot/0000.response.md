Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the product of `x` and `y`. The swapping logic in `func_1()` is flawed because it swaps digits in a way that doesn't necessarily maximize the product. Specifically:

1. The current implementation swaps digits such that the smaller digit between `a[i]` and `b[i]` goes to the higher index, which is not optimal for maximizing the product.
2. The swapping logic should prioritize making the most significant digits as large as possible while ensuring the least significant digits are also maximized.

To correct this, we need to sort the digits of both numbers in descending order and then pair the largest digits together. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    a = list(input().strip())
    b = list(input().strip())
    
    # Sort the digits in descending order
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    b.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Pair the digits from both lists
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i < len(b):
            print(a[i], end='')
        else:
            print('0', end='')  # Pad with zeros if one list is shorter
    print()
    
    for i in range(len(b)):
        if i < len(a):
            print(b[i], end='')
        else:
            print('0', end='')  # Pad with zeros if one list is shorter
    print()
```

This approach ensures that the most significant digits are maximized, leading to the highest possible product.
