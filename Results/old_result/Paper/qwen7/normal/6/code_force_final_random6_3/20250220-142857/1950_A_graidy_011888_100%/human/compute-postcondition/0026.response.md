Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user.**

The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 2 is not relevant to the given code snippet and thus remains unaltered.
