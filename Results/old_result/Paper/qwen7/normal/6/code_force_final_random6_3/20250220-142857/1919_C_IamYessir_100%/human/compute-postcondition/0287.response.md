Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` + 1, `n` must be at least 1, `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`, `y` is unchanged, and `b` and `lit` are unchanged, `x` is reassigned to the last element of list `a`.**

In this case, the code simply reassigns the value of `x` to the last element of list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
