Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` is an integer such that \(q \geq 3\) (since the loop executed 3 times initially and can continue to execute as long as there are more inputs), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input during the third iteration of the loop. The values of `t`, `q`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their last known state after the third iteration.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` remains between 1 and 1000, `q` is at least 3 (as it has gone through at least 3 iterations), `i` is the index of the last iteration (which would be `q-1`), and `a`, `b`, and `c` are the values entered during the last iteration of the loop.
