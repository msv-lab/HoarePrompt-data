Output State: **`x` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is equal to the original value of `b`, and `b` is equal to the original value of `a`**.

The code swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Since `a` was originally greater than `b`, after the swap, `a` will hold the original value of `b`, and `b` will hold the original value of `a`. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
