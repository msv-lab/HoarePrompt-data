To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition. The loop head condition here is `T`.

Let's break down the given information:

- `T` is `T - 1` at the end of the previous iteration.
- The loop continues as long as `T` is non-zero.

For the loop to execute one more time, `T` must be greater than 0. Since `T` was `T - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, `T` must be set back to a value that is greater than 0.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `T` is greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0**
