Postcondition: **`bullets_used` is `health` more than its original value, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is now `bullets_used + health`, `can_survive` remains unchanged, `pos` is the position of the next monster in the list, `health` is the health of the next monster in the list. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
