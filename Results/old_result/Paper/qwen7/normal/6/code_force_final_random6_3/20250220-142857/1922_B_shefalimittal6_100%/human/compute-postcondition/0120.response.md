Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(n):`. The only variable mentioned here is `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `idx` is increased by 1.
   - `v[x]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `n` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `n` is still greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
   - `idx` and `v[x]` are not part of the loop head, so their values do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `n` is still greater than 0.

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
