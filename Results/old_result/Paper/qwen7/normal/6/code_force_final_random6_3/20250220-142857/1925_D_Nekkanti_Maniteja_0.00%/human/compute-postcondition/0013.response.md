Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `(n * (n - 1)) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `a` plus `f`, `u` is the second integer input from the split, `v` is the third integer input from the split, `f` is the fourth integer input from the split.**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `u`, `v`, and `f` respectively. The variables `i`, `m`, `n`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, and `a` are not affected by this operation.
