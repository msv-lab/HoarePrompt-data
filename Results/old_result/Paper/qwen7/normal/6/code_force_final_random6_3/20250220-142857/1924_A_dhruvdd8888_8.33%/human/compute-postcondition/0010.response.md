Output State: **`i` is added to the set `win`; `us` is a set of integers; `ans` is a list containing the element `i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `ans`. Since `i` was previously added to the set `win`, and `us` is a set of integers, these conditions remain unchanged. The only new information is that `ans` now contains the element `i`.
