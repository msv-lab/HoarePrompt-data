Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(m)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - From the given state, `i` is initially set to `k + m`.
   - The variable `m` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it is required for the loop to execute.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < m`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` (`k + m`) should be less than `m` for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initially `k + m`, for the loop to execute, `k + m` must be less than `m`. This implies that `k` must be less than 0.
   - `m` must be a positive integer greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `k` and `m`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`s` is 0, `i` is `k + m`, `c` is `n * (n - 1) // 1`, `a` is 0, `k` must be less than 0, `m` must be greater than 0**
