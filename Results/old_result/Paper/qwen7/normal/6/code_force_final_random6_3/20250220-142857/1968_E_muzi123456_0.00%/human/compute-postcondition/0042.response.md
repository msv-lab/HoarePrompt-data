Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is `n + 1`.
2. We need to determine what `i` will be when the `print(i)` statement is executed.
3. Since `i` is defined as `n + 1`, and `n` is the same as it was before, `i` will still be `n + 1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(i)` statement will be the value of `i`, which is `n + 1`.

Output: **n + 1**
