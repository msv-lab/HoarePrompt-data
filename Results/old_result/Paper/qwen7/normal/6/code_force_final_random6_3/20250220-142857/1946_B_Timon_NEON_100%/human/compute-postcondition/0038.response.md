Output State: **`segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the current element of `arr` and its index with the first element increased by `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is either `[0, 0]` or a segment ending at some index `i-1` based on the sum comparison, and `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`, and `max_sum` remains `-1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the first element of `new_segment` by adding `arr[i]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
