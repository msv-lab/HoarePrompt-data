Based on the initial state provided:

- `sng` is a non-empty collection.
- The first element of `sng` is `elem`.
- If the size of `sng` (`sz`) is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the first element of the collection `sng`.

Output: **elem**
