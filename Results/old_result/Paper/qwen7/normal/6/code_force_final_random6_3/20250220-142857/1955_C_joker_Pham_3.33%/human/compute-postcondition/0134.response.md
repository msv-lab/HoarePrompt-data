Output State: **`l` is equal to `l` + 1, `r` remains unchanged, `k` is equal to `k - a[l] * 2`, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, and `sunks` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1, making it `l + 1`. The other variables (`r`, `k`, `a[r]`, and `sunks`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
