### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- **Input:** `extroverts` and `universals`
- **Output:** Returns the number of tents needed for `extroverts` and `universals` or `None` if it's impossible to accommodate them.

The function `func_1` has the following logic:
1. If `extroverts % 3 != 0` and `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it returns `None`.
2. Otherwise, it returns `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

This logic is flawed because it doesn't properly handle the case where there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals and another extrovert. Specifically, it fails to check if the number of extroverts can be fully paired with universals and other extroverts.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- **Input:** `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`
- **Output:** Returns the total number of tents needed or `-1` if it's impossible to accommodate all participants.

The function `func_2` calls `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals` and then adds the result to `introverts`. If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1`.

Given the flaw in `func_1`, the overall logic of `func_2` is also incorrect. It doesn't correctly handle the case where the number of extroverts cannot be fully paired with universals and other extroverts.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
Consider the test case `1 4 1` (1 introvert, 4 extroverts, 1 universal):
- `func_1(4, 1)` returns `2` because `4 % 3 + 1 >= 3`.
- `func_2(1, 4, 1)` returns `1 + 2 = 3`, which is incorrect because it's impossible to pair all 4 extroverts with two others.

#### Corrected Logic:
To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the number of extroverts can be fully paired with universals and other extroverts. We can do this by checking if the number of extroverts is less than or equal to twice the number of universals plus the number of extroverts that can be paired with another extrovert.

Here's a corrected version of `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(extroverts, universals):
    if extroverts > 2 * universals:
        return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
```

With this corrected logic, let's re-evaluate the example test case `1 4 1`:
- `func_1(4, 1)` returns `None` because `4 > 2 * 1`.
- `func_2(1, 4, 1)` returns `-1`, which is the correct output.

#### Final Evaluation:
After reviewing the program and the original assessment, the original assessment was accurate. The program does not correctly handle the case where there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals and another extrovert. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect.
