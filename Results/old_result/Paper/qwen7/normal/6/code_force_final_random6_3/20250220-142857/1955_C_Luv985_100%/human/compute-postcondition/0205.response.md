Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is greater than 0, `ans` is either 3 or 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `min(a[0], a[r])`, `t` is `k % 2`. If `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is set to 3. Otherwise, `ans` remains as either 1 or 2.**
