### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of prices.
2. **Priority Queue Initialization**: The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with the prices and their corresponding indices. This is done using `heapq.heapify` which is appropriate for finding the minimum cost.
3. **Cost Calculation Logic**:
   - The program uses a while loop to keep buying tickets until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.
   - For each iteration, it pops the smallest price from the heap, adjusts the price by adding `price_increase`, and calculates how many tickets can be bought (`tickets_to_buy`).
   - It then updates the total cost and increases the `price_increase` accordingly.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the number of tickets to buy exceeds the number of available tickets in a single day by limiting the number of tickets to `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`.
   - The logic ensures that the price increase is applied correctly after purchasing tickets on a particular day.
5. **Output**: The program prints the total cost for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly calculate the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets under the given conditions.

### Correctness:

**True**
