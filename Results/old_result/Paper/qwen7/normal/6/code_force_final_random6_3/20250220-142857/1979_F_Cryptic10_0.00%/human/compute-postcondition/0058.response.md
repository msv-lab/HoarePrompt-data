Postcondition: `v` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` contains `v`, `remaining_vertices` has had the vertex `v` removed from it, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, no change is made to the variables.
