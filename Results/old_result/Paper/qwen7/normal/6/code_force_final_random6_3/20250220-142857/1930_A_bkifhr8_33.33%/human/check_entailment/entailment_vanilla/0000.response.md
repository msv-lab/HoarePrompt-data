Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   
2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans_f` to store the answers for each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a variable `ans` to 0 to keep track of the score.
   - It reads the list of integers into `lst` after splitting the input string.

3. **Scoring Mechanism:**
   - The loop runs `n * 2` times, but this is incorrect because it should run `n` times.
   - Inside the loop, it incorrectly attempts to remove elements from `lst` in a way that does not match the problem constraints.
   - Specifically, it tries to remove elements at indices `0 * 2` and `1 * 2`, which is always the same pair of elements and does not correctly simulate the removal of any arbitrary pair of elements each time.

4. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program adds the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` to `ans` and then removes these elements.
   - However, the logic for removing elements is flawed and does not ensure that the minimum elements are always chosen and removed.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the scores stored in `ans_f`.

### Correctness Check:

- The program does not correctly implement the logic to always choose the minimum elements and remove them.
- The loop condition and element removal mechanism are incorrect.
- The program does not handle the problem constraints properly.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
