The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no loop context is provided, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of `t`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `cost`, `w`, `mu`, etc., as it only serves to bypass the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input string, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`, `cost` is calculated based on the conditions given, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`. The loop continues to the next iteration.**
