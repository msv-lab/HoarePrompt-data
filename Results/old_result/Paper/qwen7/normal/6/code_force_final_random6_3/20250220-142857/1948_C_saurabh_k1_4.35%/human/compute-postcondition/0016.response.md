Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the input integer.
- `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input.
- `b[n - 2]` is either `'<'` or not `'<'`.
- `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input.
- `b` is updated to be a list of strings converted from the input.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
