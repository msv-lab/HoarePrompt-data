Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, meaning `sz` is equal to `k`. The variable `sng` has had its first element printed `sz` times, which is now exhausted (i.e., `sng` is empty or does not contain the first element it did before). The variable `ldb` remains unchanged from its initial state, and `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` as per the initial conditions.
