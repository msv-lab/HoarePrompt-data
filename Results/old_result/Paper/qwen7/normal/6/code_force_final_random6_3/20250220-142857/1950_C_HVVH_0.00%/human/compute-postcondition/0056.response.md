Functionality: **The function processes a series of times in the format "hh:mm" and converts them to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. It prints out each converted time. After processing all inputs, the function does not return any value but leaves the variables `h`, `m`, and `day` in their final states reflecting the last processed time.**
