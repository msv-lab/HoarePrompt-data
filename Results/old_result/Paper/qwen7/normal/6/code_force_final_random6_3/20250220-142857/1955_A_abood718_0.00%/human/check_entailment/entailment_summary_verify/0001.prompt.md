You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). It prints a result based on specific conditions involving these integers. Specifically, if \(B \times 2 < C\), it prints \(A \times B\). If \(A\) is even, it prints \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\). If \(A\) is odd, it calculates \(\frac{A}{2}\), prints it, and then prints \(\frac{A}{2} \times C + B\). After processing all test cases, the function outputs the final values of \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) from the last test case, along with any previously printed intermediate results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` representing the number of yogurts to buy, the price of one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion, respectively.

2. **Logic for Calculating Minimum Cost:**
   - The program checks if the cost of buying two yogurts (`C`) is less than the cost of buying them individually (`2 * B`).
     - If `2 * B < C`, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. So, the total cost is `A * B`.
     - If `2 * B >= C`, it means it's cheaper to take advantage of the promotion.
       - It then checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even.
         - If `A` is even, the total cost is `A * C / 2` because you can buy all yogurts in pairs.
         - If `A` is odd, it buys as many pairs as possible and then buys the remaining yogurt(s) individually.
           - It calculates the number of pairs as `X = A // 2`.
           - The cost for these pairs is `X * C`.
           - The remaining yogurts are `A % 2`, and their cost is `A % 2 * B`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case.

### Verification with Examples:

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
- Input: `2 5 9`
- `A = 2`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
- Since `2 * B = 10 > C`, we use the promotion.
- `A` is even, so the cost is `2 * C / 2 = 9`.

#### Example 2:
- Input: `3 5 9`
- `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
- Since `2 * B = 10 > C`, we use the promotion.
- `A` is odd, so we buy 1 pair for `C` and 1 individual yogurt for `B`.
- Total cost is `1 * C + 1 * B = 9 + 5 = 14`.

#### Example 3:
- Input: `3 5 11`
- `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
- Since `2 * B = 10 < C`, we buy each yogurt individually.
- Total cost is `3 * B = 15`.

#### Example 4:
- Input: `4 5 11`
- `A = 4`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
- Since `2 * B = 10 < C`, we buy each yogurt individually.
- Total cost is `4 * B = 20`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
