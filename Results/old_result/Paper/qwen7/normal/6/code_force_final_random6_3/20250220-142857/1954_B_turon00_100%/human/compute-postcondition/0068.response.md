Postcondition: **After the loop completes, `ans` holds the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop's execution, `cnt` is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `a` remains the same list of integers, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, and `cnt` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration. The condition `n == 1 or ans == n` is true.**
