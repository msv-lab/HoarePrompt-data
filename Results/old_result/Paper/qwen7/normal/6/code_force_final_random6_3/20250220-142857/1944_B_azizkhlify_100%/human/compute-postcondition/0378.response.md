Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n, 2 * n):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Current State:**
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - `n` is less than or equal to 3.
   - `a[3]` exists and its value is used to index `r`.
   - The element at that index in `r` is now 0.
   - `ur` is 2.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.
   - Given `i` is 3 and `n` is less than or equal to 3, the maximum value for `2 * n` is 6 (since `n` can be at most 3).

4. **Check the Current Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is currently 3, it is less than `2 * n` (which is at most 6).
   - Therefore, the loop can continue.

5. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 4.
   - `n` remains unchanged and is still less than or equal to 3.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 4, `n` is less than or equal to 3**
