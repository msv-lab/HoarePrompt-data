Output State: **`ind` is decreased by 2, `i` is incremented by 2**

Explanation: The code `ind -= 2` decreases the value of `ind` by 2. Similarly, `i` is incremented by 2. The initial conditions that `n` must be at least 2 and that `p` is a list where an element at index `i` is assigned the value `ind` remain unchanged.
