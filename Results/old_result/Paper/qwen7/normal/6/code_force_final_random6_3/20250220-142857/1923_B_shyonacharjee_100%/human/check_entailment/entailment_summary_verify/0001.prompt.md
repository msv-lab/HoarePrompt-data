You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        bullets_used = 0
        can_survive = True
        for (pos, health) in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
            if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            bullets_used += health
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t, a list of n integers a, a list of n integers x, and two integers n and k. For each test case, it determines whether a group of monsters, represented by the positions and health values from the lists x and a, can survive a series of attacks using k bullets per unit distance. If the total health of the monsters at any position exceeds the available bullets for that position, the monsters cannot survive, and the function outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, it outputs 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs 'YES' if all monsters can survive for all test cases, and 'NO' otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Sorting**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by lists of monster healths `a` and positions `x`.
   - It sorts the monsters based on their distances from the player's starting position (point 0).

2. **Logic for Survival Check**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of monsters.
   - For each monster, it calculates the required number of bullets (`total_bullets_needed`) to kill it within the distance it can move towards the player.
   - It checks if the total bullets needed exceed the maximum possible bullets that can be used (`distance * k`).
   - If the condition is met, it sets `can_survive` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all monsters, it prints `'YES'` if the player can survive, otherwise `'NO'`.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly implements the survival check as per the problem statement. The sorting ensures that the closest monsters are handled first, and the calculations ensure that the player can determine if they have enough bullets to prevent any monster from reaching the player.

### Correctness:

- The program accurately models the game mechanics and checks if the player can survive.
- The logic is sound and follows the rules of the game as described.

**Correctness: **True**
