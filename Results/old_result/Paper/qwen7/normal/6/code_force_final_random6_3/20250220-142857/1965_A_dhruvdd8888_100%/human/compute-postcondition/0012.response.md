Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `nums`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ls` is `nums[0] + nums[i]`
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `N` is an input integer
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
   - `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)
   - `nums` is a sorted list of integers (converted from the original set `nums`)
   - `i` is 2
   - `nums[i]` is decreased by `nums[0]`

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
   - The value of `nums[i]` is already adjusted to be `nums[i] - nums[0]` at the end of the previous iteration.

Given these points, the only variable that needs to be adjusted in the loop head is `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ls` is `nums[0] + nums[i]`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `nums` is a sorted list of integers (converted from the original set `nums`), `i` is 3, and `nums[i]` is decreased by `nums[0]`**
