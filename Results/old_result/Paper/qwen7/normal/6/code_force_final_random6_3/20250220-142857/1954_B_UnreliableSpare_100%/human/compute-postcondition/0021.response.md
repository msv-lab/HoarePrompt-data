Output State: **`flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `ans` is set to `Decimal('Infinity')**.

Explanation: The code sets the variable `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')`. This does not affect the values of `flag`, `t`, `n`, or `i`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions. The value of `ans` is now specifically set to `Decimal('Infinity')`.
