Output State: **`i` is 3, `cnt` is the sum of `v[1]` and `v[0]` plus `v[i]`, `ans` is `ans` plus `v[3]` times (`v[3]` minus 1) times (`v[3]` minus 2) divided by 6 if `v[3]` is greater than or equal to 3, if `v[3]` is less than 3, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += v[i]` increments `cnt` by the value of `v[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `cnt` is updated to be the sum of `v[1]`, `v[0]`, and `v[3]`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged unless `v[3]` is greater than or equal to 3, in which case it is updated according to the given formula.
