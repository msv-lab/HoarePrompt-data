Output State: **`i` is `5 + n % 2`, `p[i]` is `ind + 6`, `ind` is `ind + 6`**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is calculated as `5 + n % 2`. The variable `ind` is updated by adding 2 to its current value, making the new value of `ind` equal to its previous value plus 2. The value of `p[i]` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it directly. Therefore, the updated value of `ind` is `ind + 6`, while `i` and `p[i]` retain their initial relationships.
