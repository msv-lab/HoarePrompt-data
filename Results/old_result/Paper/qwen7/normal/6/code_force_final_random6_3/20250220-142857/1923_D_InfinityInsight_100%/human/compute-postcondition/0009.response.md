Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`; `last` has its last element appended with itself.**

Explanation: The code appends the last element of the list `last` to itself. Since no new variables are introduced and only the last element of `last` is modified, the values of `i`, `n`, and `a[i]` remain unchanged. The list `last` now has its last element repeated.
