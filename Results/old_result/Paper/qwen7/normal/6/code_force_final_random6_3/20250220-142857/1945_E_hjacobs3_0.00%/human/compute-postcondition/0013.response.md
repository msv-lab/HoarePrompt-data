Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, `l` is `mid` + 1, `r` is at least 1, `mid` is (0 + (n - 1)) // 2**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `l` to be `mid + 1`. The values of `r`, `n`, and `mid` remain unchanged. Therefore, `l` is now `mid + 1`, while `r` is still at least 1, and `mid` is still calculated as (0 + (n - 1)) // 2.
