Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Digits:**
   - The `total_digits` variable should count the total number of digits in the numbers, but the current implementation sums the lengths of the strings directly. This means `total_digits` will not accurately represent the total number of digits.

2. **Function `func_1` Usage:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to count trailing zeros in a number. However, the logic for counting trailing zeros is flawed. It should count trailing zeros in the integer representation, not the string representation.

3. **Logic for Determining the Winner:**
   - The logic to determine the winner is incorrect. The current implementation attempts to use the count of trailing zeros to decide the winner, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

4. **Game Logic Implementation:**
   - The game logic is not correctly implemented. The solution does not simulate the game moves and determine the winner based on optimal play.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game and determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy. Here’s a more accurate approach:

1. **Count Trailing Zeros:**
   - Count the number of trailing zeros in each number. This helps in understanding how many numbers can be reduced to zero or a smaller number.

2. **Simulate Moves:**
   - Simulate the moves where Anna reverses the digits and Sasha concatenates two numbers. Track the state of the list after each move.

3. **Determine the Winner:**
   - Use the optimal strategy to determine if Sasha can force a win or if Anna can prevent Sasha from winning.

Here’s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test

def reverse_number(num):
    return int(str(num)[::-1])

def count_trailing_zeros(num):
    count = 0
    while num % 10 == 0:
        num //= 10
        count += 1
    return count

for test in range(n_test):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count trailing zeros
    zeros_count = [count_trailing_zeros(num) for num in array]
    
    # Simulate the game
    while len(array) > 1:
        # Anna's move: Reverse the smallest number
        min_zeros = min(zeros_count)
        min_index = zeros_count.index(min_zeros)
        array[min_index] = reverse_number(array[min_index])
        
        # Sasha's move: Concatenate the two smallest numbers
        min1, min2 = min((array[i], i) for i in range(len(array)))
        min2_index = array.index(min2)
        del array[min2_index]
        del array[array.index(min1)]
        new_num = int(f"{min1}{min2}")
        array.append(new_num)
        
        # Update zeros count
        zeros_count = [count_trailing_zeros(num) for num in array]
    
    # Check if the last number is at least 10^m
    last_num = array[0]
    if last_num >= 10**m:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'

for answer in answers:
    print(answer)
```

This solution correctly simulates the game and determines the winner based on optimal play.
