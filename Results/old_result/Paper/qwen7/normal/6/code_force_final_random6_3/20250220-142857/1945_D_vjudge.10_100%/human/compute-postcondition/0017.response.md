Output State: **`i` is `n-3-1`, `pergunta` is the minimum between the current value of `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`, and `x` is `x + min(a[i], b[i])`.**

Explanation: The code `x += min(a[i], b[i])` increments `x` by the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Since `i < m` is true (as per the postcondition), `i` is decremented by 1. The postcondition also mentions that `pergunta` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `x + a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is now `n-3-1`, and the other conditions regarding `pergunta` and `x` remain as specified.
