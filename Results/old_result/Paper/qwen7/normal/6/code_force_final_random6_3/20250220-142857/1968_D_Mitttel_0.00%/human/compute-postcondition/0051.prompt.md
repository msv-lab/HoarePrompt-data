Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `index` is 17 + 3 * n + 4 + 2 * n + n, `t` is `t - 2`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration, `PB` is an integer from `int(data[index + 2])`, `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is an integer from `int(data[index + 3])`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from `index` to `index + n` converted to integers, and `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from `index` to `index + n` converted to integers.

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `index` will have advanced by the total amount required for all iterations, which is 17 + 3 * n + 4 + 2 * n + n. The variable `t` will have been decremented by the number of iterations minus one (since it starts at the number of iterations and decreases by one each time). The `results` list will contain the return values from `func_1` for each iteration of the loop. The values of `PB`, `k`, and `PS` will be updated based on their positions in the `data` list after the last iteration, and `p` and `a` will be lists of integers derived from the `data` list as described.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `index` is 0, `t` is the length of `results`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration, `PB` is an integer from `int(data[index + 2])`, `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is an integer from `int(data[index + 3])`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from `index` to `index + n` converted to integers, and `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from `index` to `index + n` converted to integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the length of `results` minus 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the length of `results` minus 2, `results` must be a list with at least two elements




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
