Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `c` and `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Behavior**: The loop iterates over each element `c` in the list `s`.

3. **Analyze the Postcondition**:
   - `s` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1.
   - `ans` is updated based on the value of `cnt[1]` and the count of zeroes in `s`.
   - `ans` is also incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]` if `c` is not 0.

4. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop increments `cnt[c]` for each element `c` in `s`, the value of `cnt[c]` will change with each iteration.
   - The value of `ans` depends on the current values of `cnt[1]` and the count of zeroes in `s`.
   - The list `s` itself does not change within the loop (it is just iterated over).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `s` remains the same as it is just being iterated over.
   - `cnt[c]` will be incremented by 1 for the current value of `c`.
   - `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `cnt[c]` and the count of zeroes in `s`.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `cnt[c]` and `ans`.

Since the loop is about to start its next iteration, `c` will be the next element in the list `s`. Therefore, `cnt[c]` will be incremented by 1, and `ans` will be updated accordingly.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`s` is a non-empty list of integers, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1 for the next element `c` in `s`, and `ans` is updated based on the new value of `cnt[c]` and the count of zeroes in `s`**.
