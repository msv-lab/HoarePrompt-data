Postcondition: `segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is either a non-empty list with its elements updated according to the value of `arr[i]` or an empty list, `max_segment` is either `[0, 0]` or a segment ending at `i-1` based on the sum comparison, and `max_sum` remains `-1`. Specifically, if `new_segment` is non-empty, `new_segment` is updated to include the current value of `arr[i]` if `arr[i] >= 0`, otherwise, `new_segment` becomes an empty list and `max_segment` is updated to either `[0, 0]` if `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` or to `new_segment` if not. If `new_segment` is empty, `new_segment` remains empty, `max_segment` is set to `[arr[i], i]`, and `max_sum` remains `-1`.
