Functionality: **The function reads two lines of input: the first line contains an integer \(N\) representing the size of the list, and the second line contains \(N\) space-separated integers. It then calculates a cumulative result using the `func_1` function on these integers, storing the result in `den`. After processing, it computes a new list `vprod` based on `den` and the original list `vals`. If `den` becomes less than or equal to zero after adjusting it with `vprod`, it prints `-1` and returns. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string and returns `None`.**
