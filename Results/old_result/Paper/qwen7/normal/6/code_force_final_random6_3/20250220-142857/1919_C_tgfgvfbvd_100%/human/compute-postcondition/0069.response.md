Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are both infinity, `c` is either 0 or 1, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, and `x` is `n-1` where `n` must be greater than 0. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is set to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `c` is incremented by 1.**
