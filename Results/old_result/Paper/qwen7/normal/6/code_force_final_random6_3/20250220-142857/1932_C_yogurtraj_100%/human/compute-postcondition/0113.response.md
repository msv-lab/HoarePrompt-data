Postcondition: **`i` is -1, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `t` is the input string, `l` is the count of 'L' in the string `t`. If `t[-1]` is 'L', then `k` is `a[l - 1] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2`, and `q2` is `l`. Otherwise, `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, and `q2` is `l + 1`.**
