Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `ans` is a list with the value `k0 - sum(ans)` appended.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` was empty before this operation, the first element added to `ans` is `k0 - 0`, which simplifies to `k0`. Therefore, `ans` now contains one element, which is `k0`. The other variables remain unchanged.
