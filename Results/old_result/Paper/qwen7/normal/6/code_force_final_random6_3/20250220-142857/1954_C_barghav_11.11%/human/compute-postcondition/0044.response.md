Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(len(a))`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `i` is 1
   - `len(a)` must be greater than 1

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`. 

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `len(a)` must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 2
- `len(a)` must be greater than 1

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is 2, `len(a)` must be greater than 1**
