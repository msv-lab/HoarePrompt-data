Output State: **`index` is 13 + n + n, `PB` is an integer from `data[6]`, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, `results` is an empty list, `k` is `int(data[4])`, `PS` is an integer from `data[9]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`**.

Explanation: The variable `index` was initially set to `13 + n`. After executing `index += n`, the value of `index` is updated to `13 + n + n`. The other variables (`PB`, `t`, `results`, `k`, `PS`, and `p`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
