Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    if res:
        print(' '.join(res))
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, and find is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n.
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] >= find:
            r = mid - 1
        else:
            l = mid + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The list `array` remains a permutation of integers of length `n`, `l` is either 0 or the final value it takes after the last iteration, `r` is either `mid - 1` or 0, and `mid` is the final midpoint calculated as `(l + r) // 2`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `array` stays the same, `l` will be either 0 or the last computed midpoint plus one, `r` will be either the last computed midpoint minus one or 0, and `mid` will be the final midpoint value. The loop terminates when `l` becomes greater than `r`, indicating that the search range has been exhausted without finding an element that meets the condition `array[mid] >= find`.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the index of `l` incremented by 1, and the second string is the index of `find` in the list `array` incremented by 1.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: The list `array` remains a permutation of integers of length `n`, `l` will be either 0 or the last computed midpoint plus one, `r` will be either the last computed midpoint minus one or 0, and `mid` will be the final midpoint value. The search range has been exhausted without finding an element that meets the condition `array[mid] >= find`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `array` representing a permutation of length `n` and an integer `find` such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`. It performs a binary search on `array` to find the index of `find`. If `find` is in `array`, it returns a list containing the index of `find` in `array` incremented by 1 twice. If `find` is not in `array`, it prints `0` and returns a list containing the index of `l` incremented by 1 twice. The list `array` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
