### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the required logic.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to return the maximum value in the list `arr` considering 31 bits. However, the function call `return find_max(arr, 31)` is incorrect because `find_max` is designed to handle segments of the array and perform bitwise operations, not to simply return the maximum value of the entire array.

2. **Function `find_max`**:
   - This function is intended to recursively find the maximum number of segments such that the bitwise OR of the XORs of these segments is less than or equal to `x`.
   - The function works by iterating over the elements of the current segment (`cur_arr`) and splitting them based on the `bit`-th bit.
   - If the `bit`-th bit of the XOR of the current segment is 0, it continues to process the new segment.
   - If the `bit`-th bit of the XOR of the current segment is 1, it checks if the `bit`-th bit of `x` is also 1. If so, it returns the maximum of the length of the new segment and the result of processing the remaining part; otherwise, it returns -1.
   - The base case of the recursion is when `bit` is -1, at which point it returns the length of the current segment.

Given the problem statement and the expected behavior, the function `find_max` should be correctly implemented to handle the bitwise operations and segmentations as described. However, the function `func_1` is incorrectly calling `find_max` with the entire array without any segmentation or processing.

### Conclusion:

Since `func_1` is not correctly implemented to solve the problem as described, the overall program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
