Output State: **`end` is increased by 1, `r` is one less than its value at the start of the previous iteration and must be greater than `l`, `l` must be less than `n - 1`, and `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]` from the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Since `r` was one less than its value at the start of the previous iteration and must be greater than `l`, after decrementing, `r` will still be greater than `l`. The condition that `l` must be less than `n - 1` remains unchanged. Additionally, the condition that `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]` from the previous iteration also remains valid.
