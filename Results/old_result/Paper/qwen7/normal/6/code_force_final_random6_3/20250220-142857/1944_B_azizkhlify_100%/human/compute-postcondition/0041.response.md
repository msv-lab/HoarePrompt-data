Output State: **`i` is current_i + 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `ul` is current_ul + 4, and `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a nested structure. In this case, since no loop or nested structure is mentioned, the variables `i`, `n`, `ul`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` retain their previous values. The `break` statement does not modify any of these variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
