Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9; `output1` is an empty list; `output2` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `output2` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `x`, `n`, or `output1`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables while adding that `output2` is now also an empty list.
