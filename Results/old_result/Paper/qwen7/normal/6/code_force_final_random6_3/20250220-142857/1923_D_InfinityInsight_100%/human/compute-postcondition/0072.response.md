Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the result of `func_1(left, x)` to `inx`. The value of `i` remains 4, `n` must still be greater than 4, `x` remains as `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, and `inx` now holds the value returned by `func_1(left, x)`.
