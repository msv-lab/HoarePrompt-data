Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets to be bought (`k`) exceeds the product of the number of days (`n`) and the maximum tickets that can be purchased per day (`m`). In such cases, the program will not terminate properly and will lead to an infinite loop.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 1 10
1 1 1 1 1
```

In this case, `k` is 10, which is greater than `n * m` (5 * 1 = 5). The program will attempt to buy 10 tickets, but since the maximum tickets that can be bought per day is 1, it will keep increasing the price and buying tickets without ever completing the purchase of all 10 tickets. This leads to an infinite loop, making the program incorrect.
