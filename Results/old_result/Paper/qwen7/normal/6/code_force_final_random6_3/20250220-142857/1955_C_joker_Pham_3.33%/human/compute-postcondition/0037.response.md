Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range from 1 to \(n\), `l` is 0, `r` is \(n - 1\), `sunks` is either 1 or 3, `k` is reduced by \(2 \times a[0]\) if `k` is greater than or equal to \(2 \times a[0]\), and `a[r]` is decreased by `a[0]` if `k` is greater than or equal to \(2 \times a[0]\). If `k` is less than \(2 \times a[0]\), `sunks` is 1 and no changes are made to `k` or `a[r]`.
