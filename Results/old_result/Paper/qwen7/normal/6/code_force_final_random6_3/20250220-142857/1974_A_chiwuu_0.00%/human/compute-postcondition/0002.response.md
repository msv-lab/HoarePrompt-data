Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a string from the first input split, `b` is a string from the second input split.**

The code splits the input into two strings and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
