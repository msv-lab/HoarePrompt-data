Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`**.

Explanation: The code increments the value of `idx` by 1. Initially, `idx` was 2, so after executing `idx += 1`, `idx` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
