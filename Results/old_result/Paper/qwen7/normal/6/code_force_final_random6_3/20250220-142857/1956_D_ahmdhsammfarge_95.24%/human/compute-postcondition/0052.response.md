Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is greater than 4, `r` is 2, `l` is 3, `over_sum` is `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:2]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm`. Initially, `sm` was defined as `sum(lst[:2]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`. After executing the code, `sm` is updated to `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. Since `i` is 2, `sum(lst[:i])` becomes `sum(lst[:2])`. The value of `j` is still greater than 4, and `i` remains 2. Therefore, the updated expression for `sm` is `sum(lst[:2]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
