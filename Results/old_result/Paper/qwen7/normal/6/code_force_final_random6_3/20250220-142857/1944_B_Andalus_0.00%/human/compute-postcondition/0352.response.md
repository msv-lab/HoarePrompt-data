Output State: **`sz` is 0, `i` will be `n`, `n` remains unchanged, and `rdb` will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt`.**

Explanation: The code `sz = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `sz`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or `rdb`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions where `i` will be `n` after the loop, `n` remains unchanged, and `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt`.
