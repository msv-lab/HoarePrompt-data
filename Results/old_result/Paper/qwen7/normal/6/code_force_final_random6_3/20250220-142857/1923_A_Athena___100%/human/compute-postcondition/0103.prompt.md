Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is `t - 2 * n`, `a` is an empty list, `res` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (up to 3 times based on the given conditions), the list `a` will be completely emptied since it removes elements from the front as long as the first element is 0. Given that the loop runs up to 3 times, `t` will have decreased by `2 * n` (where `n` is the input integer) over these iterations. The variable `res` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop, and `a` becomes an empty list once all its elements are removed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == 0:
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is `t - 2 * n`, `a` is a non-empty list with at least one element, and `res` is 1 if `a[i]` is 0. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is `t - 2 * n`, `a` is a non-empty list with at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, and `res` is `res + 1` if `a[i]` is 0. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is `t - 2 * n`, `a` is a non-empty list with at least one element, `i` is `i + 2`, and `res` is `res + 1` if `a[i]` is 0; otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
