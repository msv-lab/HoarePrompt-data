Postcondition: `k` is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 0, `r[j]` (for `j` ranging from `0` to `n-1`) contains the count of how many times the value `j+1` appears in the list `a`, `ul` is `2 * k` if the loop exited because `ul == k * 2`, or it is the last value calculated before the loop potentially exited, `l` has been updated such that for each `a[i]`, the corresponding element in `l` is set to 0; `re` is equal to `k + 1`, `res` contains the value of `a[i]` and `res` is appended with `a[i]`.
