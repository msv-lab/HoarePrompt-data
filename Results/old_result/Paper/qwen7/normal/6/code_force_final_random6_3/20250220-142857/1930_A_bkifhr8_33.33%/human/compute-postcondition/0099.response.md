Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations, so `i` is now greater than `n * 2`. The variable `t` remains the same as it was initially. The variable `ans` contains the cumulative sum of the minimum values of the first two elements of `lst`, taken until the condition `len(lst) != 2` no longer holds or the loop breaks due to the length being 2. The list `lst` will have been modified such that it no longer contains any elements that were removed during the loop's execution.**

This means that after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `i` will exceed `n * 2`, `t` will retain its original value, `ans` will be the sum of the minimum values of the first two elements of `lst` for each iteration where the length of `lst` is not 2, and `lst` will be reduced by the elements that were removed during the loop's execution.
