Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, l1))` takes the list `l1` which is a list of strings and converts each string into an integer using `map(int, l1)`. It then assigns the first converted integer to `n` and the second converted integer to `k`. The initial state of `t` and `l1` remains unchanged.
