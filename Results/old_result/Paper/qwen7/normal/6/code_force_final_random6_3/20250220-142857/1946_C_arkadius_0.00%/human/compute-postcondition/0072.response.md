Postcondition: **The `tree.vertices[v].good_components` attribute will be the sum of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for all children `u` of vertex `v`, plus one for each child `u` where `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. The `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` attribute will be the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all children `u` of vertex `v`. The state of all other attributes and the structure of the tree will remain unchanged.**
