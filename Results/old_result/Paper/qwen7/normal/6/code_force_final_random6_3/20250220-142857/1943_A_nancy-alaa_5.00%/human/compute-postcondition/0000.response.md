Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value used in the `range()` function.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as the input value is a positive integer. Given the constraints, the input value (let's call it `t`) should be a positive integer between 1 and \(2 \times 10^4\).

3. **Adjust the initial state**: Since the loop depends on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value meets the required conditions. The initial state before the loop starts is given as `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value `t`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\)**
