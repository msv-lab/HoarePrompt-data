Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program attempts to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the multipliers and then distributes the coins based on this GCD. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes will be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
3
5
5 5 5 5 5
3
6 3 2
5
9 4 6 8 3
```
- Expected Output:
```
-1
8 18 12 9 24
```
- Actual Output:
```
-1
1 1
-1
```

In the first test case, the program correctly outputs `-1` because it is impossible to distribute the coins in a way that satisfies the condition for `n=5` and `k=[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`.

However, in the second test case, the program incorrectly outputs `1 1`, which does not satisfy the condition for `n=3` and `k=[6, 3, 2]`. The total amount of coins bet is `1 + 1 = 2`, but the amounts received back are `6, 3, 4`, respectively, none of which are strictly greater than `2`.

In the third test case, the program again incorrectly outputs `-1`, which is not the expected output.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and hence is incorrect.
