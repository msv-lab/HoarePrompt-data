Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `n` is not equal to 2, `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the current value of `count_1` remains unchanged. If `count_1` is even, `count_1` remains even, and the string `s` either contains exactly one occurrence of '11' or does not contain exactly one occurrence of '11'.
