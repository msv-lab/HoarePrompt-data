Output State: **`data[idx]` is converted to an integer and assigned to `n`, `results` contains a string representation of `ans` appended to it, `cnt` is increased by `v[i]` for each `i` in the range `[3, n + 1)`, `ans` is updated according to the formulae provided in the loop body for each `i` in the same range, and `t` is `t - 1`.**

This means that the value of `n` is now the integer representation of `data[idx]`, while the other variables (`results`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `t`) remain in their respective states as described in the initial state, with the operations specified in the loop body yet to be executed.
