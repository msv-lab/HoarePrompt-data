Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user.
- It is not the case that `a < b < c`.
- Either `a >= b` or `b <= c`.

The print statement is:

```python
print('NONE')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NONE'`. Since there are no conditions or calculations involved in this print statement, the output is simply the string `'NONE'`.

Output: **NONE**
