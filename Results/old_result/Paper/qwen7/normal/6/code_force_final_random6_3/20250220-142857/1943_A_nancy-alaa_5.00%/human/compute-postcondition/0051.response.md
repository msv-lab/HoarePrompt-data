Output State: **`first` remains False, `i` is the next key in `mpp` where `mpp[key] == 1` or the last key in `mpp`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `mpp = Counter(arr)` creates a `Counter` object named `mpp` which counts the occurrences of each element in the list `arr`. The other variables (`first`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
