Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `ele`, which iterates over the list `l`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `ele`**: Since `ele` is iterating over the list `l`, the initial value of `ele` should be the first element of the list `l`.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the list `l` is not empty, as the loop will iterate over its elements. Additionally, since `ele` will take the value of the first element of `l` in the first iteration, we need to set `ele` to the first element of `l`.

Given the initial states:
- `c` is 0 (not relevant for the loop execution)
- `n` is the first integer entered (not relevant for the loop execution)
- `k` is the second integer entered (not relevant for the loop execution)
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer (we need to ensure it's not empty and set `ele` to the first element)
- `maxi` is 0 (not relevant for the loop execution)

We need to adjust the state of `l` to ensure it is not empty and set `ele` to the first element of `l`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`l` is a non-empty list of integers, `ele` is the first element of `l`**
