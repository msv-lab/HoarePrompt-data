The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the execution of the code does not change any variable values or states. The variables remain in their initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is the maximum value of the second largest element in any consecutive subarray of length 3 within `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `temp` is a sorted sublist of `a` starting from index `n-4` and ending at index `n-1`.**
