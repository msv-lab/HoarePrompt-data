To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head: `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `st` is equal to the number of consecutive identical elements at the beginning of the list.
- `end` is 0.
- `l` is the index right after the last pair of identical elements found.
- `r` is `n - 1`.

Let's analyze the loop conditions:

1. **Condition `r > l`:**
   - Initially, `r` is `n - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than `r`.

2. **Condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]`:**
   - Initially, `r` is `n - 1`, so `a[r - 1]` is `a[n - 2]`.
   - For the loop to execute, `a[n - 2]` must be equal to `a[n - 1]`.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that both conditions are met when the loop starts.

### Adjusting the States:
- **`r` must be greater than `l`:** Since `r` is initially `n - 1`, `l` must be less than `n - 1`.
- **`a[r - 1]` must be equal to `a[r]`:** Since `r` is initially `n - 1`, `a[n - 2]` must be equal to `a[n - 1]`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `l` must be less than `n - 1`.
- `a[n - 2]` must be equal to `a[n - 1]`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`st` is equal to the number of consecutive identical elements at the beginning of the list, `end` is 0, `l` must be less than `n - 1`, and `a[n - 2]` must be equal to `a[n - 1]`**.
