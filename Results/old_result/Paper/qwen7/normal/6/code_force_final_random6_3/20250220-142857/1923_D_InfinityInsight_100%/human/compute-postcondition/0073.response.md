Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[3]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `last[i - 1]` to `inx2`. Given that `i` is 4, `inx2` becomes `last[3]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `x`, and `inx` remain unchanged from their initial states.
