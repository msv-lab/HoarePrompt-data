You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func():

        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is the last integer input split from `input().split()` after all iterations, `m` is the last value of `m` read from `input().split()` after all iterations, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is the final accumulated sum calculated by the loop, `countmins` is `m`, `g` is `n / ((m + 1) * (m + 1)) - m / (m + 1) + 1`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `t + 1` because the loop runs `t` times, incrementing `i` from 0 to `t - 1`, and then `i` is incremented one more time after the loop finishes. The variable `count` will be equal to `m + 1` because the loop increments `count` until it is greater than `m`. The variable `ans` will contain the final accumulated sum, which is calculated by adding `g / count + 1` for each iteration from `count = 3` to `count = m + 1`. The variable `countmins` will be `m` when the loop ends. The variable `g` will be updated in the last iteration as `n / ((m + 1) * (m + 1)) - m / (m + 1) + 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b) using a while loop and some arithmetic operations, but it does not accurately reflect the conditions specified in the problem statement.

To illustrate, consider the test case (10, 8):

- According to the problem, we need to count pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

- For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the valid pairs are:
  - (1, 1): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
  - (2, 1): \(2 + 1 = 3\) and \(3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\).
  - (2, 2): \(2 + 2 = 4\) and \(4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\).
  - (3, 1): \(3 + 1 = 4\) and \(4\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(3, 1) = 1\).
  - (4, 1): \(4 + 1 = 5\) and \(5\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(4, 1) = 1\).
  - (5, 1): \(5 + 1 = 6\) and \(6\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(5, 1) = 1\).
  - (6, 1): \(6 + 1 = 7\) and \(7\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(6, 1) = 1\).
  - (6, 2): \(6 + 2 = 8\) and \(8\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(6, 2) = 2\).
  - (6, 3): \(6 + 3 = 9\) and \(9\) is a multiple of \(3 \cdot \gcd(6, 3) = 3\).
  - (7, 1): \(7 + 1 = 8\) and \(8\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(7, 1) = 1\).
  - (8, 1): \(8 + 1 = 9\) and \(9\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(8, 1) = 1\).
  - (9, 1): \(9 + 1 = 10\) and \(10\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(9, 1) = 1\).
  - (10, 1): \(10 + 1 = 11\) and \(11\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(10, 1) = 1\).
  - (10, 2): \(10 + 2 = 12\) and \(12\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(10, 2) = 2\).

This results in 14 valid pairs, but the program outputs 14 for this test case, which seems correct. However, the logic used in the program is flawed and does not generalize correctly for all inputs. For instance, the program incorrectly handles the gcd calculation and the condition checking, leading to incorrect results for other test cases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
