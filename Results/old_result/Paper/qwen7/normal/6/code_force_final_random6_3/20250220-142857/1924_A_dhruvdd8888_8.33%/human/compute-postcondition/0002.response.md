Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets, us is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.**

Explanation: The code creates a set `us` that contains the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. This is done using a generator expression within the `set` constructor, which iterates over the range from `0` to `k-1`, converting each integer to its corresponding lowercase letter using `chr(i + 97)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
