Postcondition: `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 6, `n` is `x`, `output1` is a list containing the integer 5, and `output2` is a list containing the integer `x / 6`. If `x` is divisible by 6, then `output2` is updated to contain `x / 6`. Otherwise, `output2` remains unchanged.
