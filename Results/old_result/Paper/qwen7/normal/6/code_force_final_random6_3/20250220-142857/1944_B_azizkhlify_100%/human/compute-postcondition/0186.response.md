Output State: **`i` is `2 * n + 1`, and `ul` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop, but since no loop was specified in the initial state or the code snippet, we assume it exits the most recent loop. The values of `i` and `ul` are not modified by the `break` statement itself. Therefore, `i` remains as `2 * n + 1` and `ul` remains unchanged.
