Output State: **`total_max_segment` is now equal to `segment`; `segment` is the next element in `segments_variants`.**

Explanation: The code `total_max_segment = segment` updates the value of `total_max_segment` to be the same as the current value of `segment`. The value of `segment` remains unchanged, and it is still referred to as the "next element in `segments_variants`" from the initial state.
