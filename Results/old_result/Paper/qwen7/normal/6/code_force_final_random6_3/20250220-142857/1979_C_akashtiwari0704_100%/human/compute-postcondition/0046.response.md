Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `l`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `g` is updated to `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0]) * l[i] // gcd(g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0]), l[i])`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `len(l)` must be greater than 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each `i` in the range from 0 to `len(l) - 1`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` would be 3 if the loop continues.
   - The length of the list `l` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `len(l)` remains the same and must still be greater than 1.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `g` remains unchanged as it is not directly modified in the loop head but rather inside the loop body.
   - `i` changes to 3.
   - `len(l)` must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `g` is updated to `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0]) * l[i] // gcd(g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0]), l[i])`, `i` is 3, `len(l)` must be greater than 1**
