Postcondition: `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is increased by 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, then `r` is decreased by 1 and we continue with the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `k` is adjusted to `k - a[l] * 2`, `l` is incremented by 1, `r` remains unchanged, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, and `sunks` is increased by 1.
