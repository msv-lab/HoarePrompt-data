Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in sng:`. This means the loop iterates over each element in the iterable `sng`.

2. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

3. **Understand the given state after loop execution**: The state after the loop has executed all its iterations is that `sz` is equal to `k`.

4. **Analyze the loop behavior**: Since the loop iterates over each element in `sng`, the final value of `sz` (which is equal to `k`) indicates that the loop has processed all elements in `sng`. Therefore, `sng` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjust the initial state**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `sng` is an iterable with at least one element. The variable `sz` being equal to `k` at the end of the loop execution implies that the loop has iterated over all elements in `sng`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `sng` must be an iterable with at least one element.
- `sz` must be equal to `k` after the loop has executed all its iterations.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: `sng` is an iterable with at least one element, `sz` is equal to `k`**
