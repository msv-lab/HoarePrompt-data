State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and `q` must be 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for q in range(t):` will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer greater than 0.
2. At the start of the loop, the variable `q` is set to 0 by the `range(t)` function.
3. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `q` must be initialized to 0.

This ensures that the loop condition `q < t` will be true for at least one iteration if `t` is greater than 0.
