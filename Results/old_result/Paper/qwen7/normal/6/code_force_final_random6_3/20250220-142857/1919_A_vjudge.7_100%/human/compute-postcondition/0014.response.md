Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state mentions that `test` must be at least 1. This means `test` is an integer with a minimum value of 1.
2. `t` is defined as `t + 1`. Since no initial value for `t` is provided, we cannot determine its exact value, but it will be incremented by 1 from whatever its initial value was.
3. `a` is described as an input integer, so its value is unknown but it is an integer.
4. `b` is also described as an input integer, so its value is unknown but it is an integer.
5. The `print` statement simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Given this information, the only thing that is explicitly printed is the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **'Alice'**
