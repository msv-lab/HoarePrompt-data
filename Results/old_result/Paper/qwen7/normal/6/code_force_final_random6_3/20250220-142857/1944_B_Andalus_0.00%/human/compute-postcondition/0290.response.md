Output State: **`sng` is an empty iterable, `sz` is `sz` + 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of `sng` or `sz`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since the initial state of `sz` is `sz` + 1, it remains as `sz` + 1 after the code execution.
