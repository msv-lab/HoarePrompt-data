Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and the variable `i` is now equal to `2 * n`. The list `r` has been updated such that each element `r[j]` (where `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`) contains the count of how many times the value `j+1` appears in the list `a`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `r[j]` will contain the count of how many times the value `j+1` appears in the list `a`. The other variables (`i`) remain unchanged from their final states after the third iteration, with `i` being `2 * n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        l[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list where the element at index `a[0] - 1` is 2, and `ul` equals 2 if `l[a[0] - 1]` equals 2; otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `l`, and `ul` remain unchanged. If the condition `ul == k * 2` is satisfied, the process breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list where the element at index `a[0] - 1` is 0, and `ul` is 4 if `l[a[0] - 1]` equals 2; otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `l`, and `ul` remain unchanged. If `ul == k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list where the element at index `a[0] - 1` is 0, and `ul` is 6. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
