Output State: **`x` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is equal to the original value of `b`, `b` is equal to the original value of `a`, and the current value of `l[x]` is now equal to `b`.**

Explanation: The code `b = l[x]` assigns the value of `l[x]` to `b`. Since `x` is 0, `b` is now set to the value of `l[0]`. The other variables (`a`, `n`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
