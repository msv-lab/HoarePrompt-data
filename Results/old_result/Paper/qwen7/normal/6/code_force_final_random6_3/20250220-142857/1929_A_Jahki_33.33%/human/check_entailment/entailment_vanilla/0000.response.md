Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array elements as a string `case`.

2. **Parsing Input:**
   - It converts the string `case` into a list of integers `a` using list comprehension and `isdigit()`.

3. **Checking Initial Order:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the initial array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If `a` is already sorted, it prints `0` because no rearrangement is needed, and the beauty is `0`.
   - Otherwise, it proceeds to calculate the maximum beauty.

4. **Calculating Maximum Beauty:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The beauty is calculated by summing up `(b[x] - b[x - 1])` for all `x` from `1` to `num2 - 1`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Function `func_1` Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` is unnecessary and does not contribute to solving the problem. The logic to check if the array is sorted can be done directly without this function.
   
2. **Sorting and Calculation:**
   - Sorting the array `a` and then calculating the beauty is correct. However, the sorting should be done once, and the calculation should use the sorted array.

3. **Rearranging Elements:**
   - The problem states that Sasha can rearrange the elements in any way to maximize the beauty. Sorting the array ensures that the difference between consecutive elements is maximized, which is the optimal solution.

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly identifies if the array is already sorted and prints `0` if so.
- It sorts the array and calculates the beauty correctly by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

Given these points, the program is logically sound and correctly implements the solution.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the steps outlined above.
