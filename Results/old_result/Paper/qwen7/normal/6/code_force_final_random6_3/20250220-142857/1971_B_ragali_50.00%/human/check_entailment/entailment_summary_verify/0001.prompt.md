You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) followed by a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` can be split into two halves such that reversing one half and concatenating it with the other half results in a different string, or if reversing the entire string results in a different string. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints the modified string according to the conditions checked.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Character Set Check**: It checks if the string `s` has more than one unique character using a set. If there is more than one unique character, it means the string can be rearranged to form a different string.
3. **Rearrangement Logic**:
   - **Case 1**: If the string has more than one unique character, it attempts to rearrange the string by splitting it into two halves and concatenating them in reverse order. This is intended to create a new string that is different from the original.
   - **Case 2**: If the rearrangement in Case 1 results in the same string, it tries to reverse the entire string. If the reversed string is different from the original, it prints the reversed string.
   - **Case 3**: If both the rearranged and reversed strings are the same as the original, it prints the string formed by concatenating the second half with the first half of the original string.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Unique Character**: If the string consists of only one unique character, it correctly outputs "NO" because no rearrangement can produce a different string.
   - **Strings of Length 1**: For strings of length 1, the logic should handle this edge case appropriately, but the current implementation does not explicitly check for this scenario. However, since the problem specifies that the length is at most 10, and the logic handles single-character strings implicitly by failing the condition `len(a) > 1`, this is not a critical issue.

### Analysis:
- The logic for rearranging the string is flawed. Specifically, the approach of splitting the string into two halves and concatenating them in reverse order or reversing the entire string may not always produce a different string, especially for even-length strings.
- The logic does not guarantee that the generated string `r` is different from `s`. For example, if the string is `co`, the logic would produce `oc`, which is a valid rearrangement but not necessarily different from the original in the context of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not always produce a different string `r` from the original string `s` when it is possible to do so. Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
