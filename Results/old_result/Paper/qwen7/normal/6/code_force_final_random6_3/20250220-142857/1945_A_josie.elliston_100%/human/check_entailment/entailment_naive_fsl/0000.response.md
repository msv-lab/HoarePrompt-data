Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals and another extrovert. Specifically, consider the following test case:

- Input: `1 4 1` (1 introvert, 4 extroverts, 1 universal)
- Expected Output: `-1` (since it's impossible to pair all extroverts with two others)

However, the current implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` does not account for this scenario properly. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It checks if `extroverts % 3 != 0` and if `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`. If true, it returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - It calls `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals`.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the result of `func_1` to `introverts`.

For the input `1 4 1`:
- `func_1(4, 1)` will check `4 % 3 != 0` (which is true), and `4 % 3 + 1 < 3` (which is false).
- Since `4 % 3 + 1 >= 3`, `func_1(4, 1)` will return `ceil((4 + 1) / 3) = 2`.
- `func_2(1, 4, 1)` will then return `1 + 2 = 3`.

This is incorrect because it fails to recognize that there are 4 extroverts and only 1 universal, making it impossible to pair all extroverts with two others. Therefore, the correct output should be `-1`.

To fix this, the logic in `func_1` needs to ensure that the number of extroverts can be fully paired with universals and other extroverts. One possible solution would be to check if the number of extroverts is less than or equal to twice the number of universals plus the number of extroverts that can be paired with another extrovert.
