Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases for converting 24-hour format to 12-hour format. Specifically:

1. When the hour is `00`, it correctly converts it to `12` and sets `day` to `'AM'`.
2. However, when the hour is `12` in the 24-hour format, the program incorrectly sets `day` to `'PM'` regardless of whether it's the first half of the day or the second.

To fix this, the condition for setting `day` to `'PM'` should only apply if the hour is greater than `12`. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM' if h != 12 else 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')
```

This ensures that `day` is set correctly to `'AM'` for times like `12:00` and `'PM'` for times like `13:00`.
