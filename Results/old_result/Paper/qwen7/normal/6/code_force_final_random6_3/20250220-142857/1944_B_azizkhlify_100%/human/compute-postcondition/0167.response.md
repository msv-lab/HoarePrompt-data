Output State: **`i` is `2 * n`, `a` is a list of integers, `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0, `ul` is increased by 2, and the current value of `ul` is equal to `k * 2`.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the loop or switch statement it is within. Since no such context is provided, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
