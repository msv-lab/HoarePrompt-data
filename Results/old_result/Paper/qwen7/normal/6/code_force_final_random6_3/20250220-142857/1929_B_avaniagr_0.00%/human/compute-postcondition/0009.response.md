Output State: The loop will continue to execute for as many lines of input as provided, with each iteration processing the next line of input. For each line, `n` is the first integer split from the line, and `k` is the second integer split from the line.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the final output state will be determined by the last line of input processed. Specifically, `s` will be the last line of input after skipping the first line, `n` will be the first integer split from this last line, and `k` will be the second integer split from this last line.

The expression inside the `print` statement will evaluate based on the final values of `n` and `k` from the last line of input. If `k < 4 * n - 3`, it will print `(k // 2 + k % 2)`. If `k >= 4 * n - 3`, it will print `2 * n`. And if `k == 4 * n - 2`, it will also print `2 * n`.
