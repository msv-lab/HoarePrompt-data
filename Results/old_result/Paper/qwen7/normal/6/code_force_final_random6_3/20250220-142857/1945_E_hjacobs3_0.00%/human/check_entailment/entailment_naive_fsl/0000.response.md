Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the required functionality. According to the problem description, the goal is to rearrange the permutation such that `p[l]` equals `x` after performing at most 2 swaps. However, the provided implementation only performs a binary search and checks if the middle element matches `x`. If it doesn't match, it adjusts the search range but does not attempt to place `x` at the correct position.

Here is an example where the program fails:
- Input:
  ```
  3 3
  1 2 3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  0
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  1
  1 2
  ```

In this case, the permutation is already sorted, and `x` (which is 3) is already in the correct position (`p[2]`). The program incorrectly prints `1` and suggests swapping `p[1]` and `p[2]`, which is unnecessary.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that `x` is placed at the correct index before performing the binary search. This involves identifying the correct position for `x` and performing the necessary swaps to achieve this.
