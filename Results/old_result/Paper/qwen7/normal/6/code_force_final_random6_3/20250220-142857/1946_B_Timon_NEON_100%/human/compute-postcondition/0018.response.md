Output State: **`segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is [arr[i], arr[i]], `max_sum` is -1, and `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `max_segment[0]` by adding the value of `arr[i]` to it. Since `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment[0]` now equals `arr[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
