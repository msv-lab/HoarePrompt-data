Output State: **`fav` is not equal to `l[i]`, `k` is decreased by `dic[l[i]]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block that was modifying `k` and `i`. The values of `fav`, `k`, `i`, and `dic[l[i]]` remain unchanged from their initial states, but the execution flow is now outside of the loop or conditional block.
