Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes t test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and n is even) representing the width of the grid, followed by two strings of length n consisting only of '<' and '>' characters representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid respectively. The function returns a result for each test case indicating whether it's possible to start from any cell in the first row and move through the grid following the arrows to reach any cell in the second row without violating the movement rules.**
