Output State: The stack contains a series of pairs \((u_i, False)\) where each \(u_i\) is a child vertex of \(v\) and the children list of \(tree.vertices[v]\) is non-empty for all iterations.

In simpler terms, the stack will contain a sequence of vertices that are children of the initial vertex \(v\), each marked as not visited (`False`). This continues until there are no more children left to process, meaning the stack will eventually be empty if the tree is finite and all vertices are processed.
