Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` from the `cur_arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `cur_arr`. There is no explicit condition given in the loop itself, but the postcondition tells us that if `cur_arr` must contain at least one element, the loop can proceed.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - `cur_arr`: Since the loop iterates over each element in `cur_arr`, and the loop continues as long as `cur_arr` contains at least one element, `cur_arr` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.
   - `xor`: The `xor` value is updated with each iteration, but the problem does not specify how it is updated. However, since the loop continues based on the presence of elements in `cur_arr`, `xor` itself does not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue.
   - `new_arr`: The `new_arr` is populated based on the value of `xor` when its bit-th bit is 0. This does not affect the continuation of the loop directly.

Given the above points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `cur_arr` to ensure it still contains at least one element for the loop to continue.

**State:**
- `cur_arr` must contain at least one element.
- `xor` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
- `new_arr` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

So, the final state is:

State: **`cur_arr` must contain at least one element, `xor` is the result of XORing each element in `cur_arr` with the current value of `xor`, `new_arr` contains the value of `xor` appended to it if the bit-th bit of `xor` is 0**.
