Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, N is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**

Explanation: The code `N = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `N`. This input represents the number of test cases. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and not affected by the code.
