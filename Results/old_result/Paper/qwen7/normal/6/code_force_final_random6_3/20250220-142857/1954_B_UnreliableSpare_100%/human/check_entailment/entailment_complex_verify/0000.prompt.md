You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5; the array a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the array a is beautiful; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.

    #State: Output State: `flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and if `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. The variable `flag` is set to `False` as soon as any two consecutive elements in the array `arr` are found to be different, causing the loop to break. Since the loop breaks on the first difference encountered, `flag` remains `False` regardless of how many iterations it takes to find the difference. The variable `t` and the condition on `n` (which must be greater than 1) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
        
    #State: `flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `0`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`, and `cnt` is `0`
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: `flag` is either `True` or `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `0`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr` after updating it with `min(ans, cnt)`, and `cnt` is `0`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a single test case consisting of an integer `n`, an array `arr` of length `n`, and implicitly an integer `t`. It checks if the array `arr` is monotonically the same (i.e., all elements are identical). If the array is not monotonically the same, it calculates the minimum number of consecutive identical elements in the array. Finally, it prints `-1` if the array is monotonically the same, otherwise it prints the calculated minimum count.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has alternating elements that would make it beautiful after removing a single element. For example, consider the input:

```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

The program should output `1` because removing the second element (`2`) makes the array `[1, 1, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful. However, the current implementation does not handle this scenario properly. It checks if the array is already beautiful and if not, it tries to find the minimum number of elements to remove, but it does not correctly identify the need to remove a single element in the case of alternating sequences.

To fix this, the program needs to specifically check for alternating sequences and handle them appropriately.
