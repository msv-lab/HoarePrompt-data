Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring shifted.
2. The annotated program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Specifically:
   - `func_1` takes a list of integers as input, which is not consistent with the problem statement requiring a binary string.
   - The logic in `func_1` sums up `n + 1` for every occurrence of '0' following one or more '1's, plus one additional count for each standalone '1'. This does not account for the minimum cost of cyclic shifts required to sort the string.
   - `func_2` calls `func_1` for each test case but does not handle the actual binary string input correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
