Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, `temp` is a set containing one element `(q + r) % n`, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer obtained from converting the first split element of the result of `func_1()` to an integer, `c` is a string obtained from the second split element of the result of `func_1()` and its value is either '0' or '?'**.

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the value of `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `temp` was initially an empty set, now it contains one element, which is `(q + r) % n`. All other variables (`ans`, `m`, `r`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
