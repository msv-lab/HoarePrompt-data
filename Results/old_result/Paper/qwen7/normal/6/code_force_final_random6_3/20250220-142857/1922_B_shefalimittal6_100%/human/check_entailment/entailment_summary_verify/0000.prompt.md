You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        v = [0] * (n + 1)
        for _ in range(n):
            x = int(data[idx])
            idx += 1
            v[x] += 1
        cnt = 0
        ans = 0
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if v[i] >= 2:
                ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
            if v[i] >= 3:
                ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
            cnt += v[i]
        results.append(str(ans))
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) (number of test cases), a positive integer \( n \) (size of the list), and a list of non-negative integers \( a \). For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on the frequency of each integer in the list \( a \). This value is derived from combinations of counts of integers appearing at least twice or three times. The function then stores these calculated values as strings in a list and prints them, one per line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to count the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. However, it does not check the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three lengths to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
3
3
2 1 1
```

The program will output `3` because it counts all combinations of three sticks, but it does not check if they can form a triangle. In this case, the combination (1, 1, 2) cannot form a non-degenerate triangle since \(1 + 1 \not> 2\).

To fix this, the program needs to include a check for the triangle inequality theorem. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        v = [0] * (n + 1)
        for _ in range(n):
            x = int(data[idx])
            idx += 1
            v[x] += 1
        
        ans = 0
        for combo in combinations(range(n + 1), 3):
            if v[combo[0]] > 0 and v[combo[1]] > 0 and v[combo[2]] > 0:
                a, b, c = sorted(combo)
                if a + b > c:
                    ans += v[a] * v[b] * v[c]
        
        results.append(str(ans))
    print('\n'.join(results))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

This corrected version uses `combinations` from the `itertools` module to generate all possible combinations of three stick lengths and checks if they satisfy the triangle inequality theorem before counting them.
