Output State: **`res` is a non-negative integer decreased by 3, `n` must be at least 1, `ans` is unchanged, `k` is 0, `dif` is the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `res -= 1` decreases the value of `res` by 1. Since `res` was initially a non-negative integer decreased by 2, after executing this line, `res` becomes a non-negative integer decreased by 3. All other variables (`n`, `ans`, `k`, and `dif`) remain unchanged.
