Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `r` is either `mid - 1` or at least 0, and `mid` is now `(l + r) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. The values of `array`, `r`, and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial states.
