Output State: **`segments_variants` is a list of segments, `new_segment` is [arr[i], i], `max_segment` is the best segment found so far based on the sum comparison, and `max_sum` remains -1.**

Explanation: The code assigns `[arr[i], i]` to `new_segment`. This means that `new_segment` now contains the current element of `arr` and its index. The value of `i` is updated to `i_end + 1`. Since the code does not explicitly check whether `new_segment` is non-empty or empty, the behavior described in the problem statement (adding `new_segment` to `segments_variants` and updating `max_segment` if `new_segment` is non-empty, or updating `max_segment` based on the current element of `arr` and its index if `new_segment` is empty) is not directly reflected in the given code snippet. However, the initial conditions and the direct assignment to `new_segment` are preserved in the output state.
