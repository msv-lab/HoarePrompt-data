Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty list of integers, `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1 for the next element `0` in `s`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[0]` was greater than 0 (either from the if part or the previous state), and the update to `ans` also considers the difference between the number of zeroes in `s` and the new value of `cnt[0]`.
