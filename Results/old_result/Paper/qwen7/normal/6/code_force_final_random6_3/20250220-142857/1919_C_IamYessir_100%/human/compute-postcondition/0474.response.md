Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` and `b` are lists whose states depend on the value of `lit[i+2]` relative to `x` and `y`, `cp` remains 0, if `b` is not empty, `x` is greater than `y`, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, if `x` is equal to `y`, then `x` remains equal to `y`, `x` is equal to the last element of list `a` if `len(a) != 0`, otherwise `x` is set to positive infinity, `b` now contains an additional element which is the integer corresponding to `lit[i+1]` if `y >= lit[i+1]` or `y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of list `b`.
