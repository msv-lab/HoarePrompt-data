Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- **State at the end of the previous iteration**: `t` is the length of `results` minus 1.
- **For Loop Statement**: 
  ```python
  for result in results:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `result` and the iterable `results`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in the `results` list.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is the length of `results` minus 1. This means that the current index `t` points to the last element in the `results` list.
2. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in the `results` list must be accessible. Since `t` is currently pointing to the last element, the next element would be the one before it (index `t-1`).

### Adjusted States
- **`t`**: After the loop advances to the next element, `t` should point to the second-to-last element in the `results` list.
- **`results`**: The `results` list remains the same unless modified within the loop body, but we need to ensure it still contains at least two elements for the loop to continue.

### Final State
State: **`t` is the length of `results` minus 2, `results` must be a list with at least two elements**.

This ensures that the loop can proceed to the next iteration by accessing the second-to-last element in the `results` list.
