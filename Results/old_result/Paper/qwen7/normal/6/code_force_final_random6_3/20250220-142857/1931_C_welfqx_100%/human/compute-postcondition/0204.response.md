Output State: **`j` is `n-2`, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of `num`, `ck` is 2, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `ii` is `n-2`**

Explanation: The code `ck += 1` increments the value of `ck` by 1. Initially, `ck` was set to 1, so after executing this line, `ck` becomes 2. The values of the other variables (`j`, `f`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, and `ii`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
