Output State: **`input_value` is an integer, `word` is either "zz", "aay", or "aaa", `i` is `input_value` + 2, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer, but does not affect the values of `input_value`, `word`, or `i`. The condition for setting `word` based on the value of `n` remains unchanged because `n` is now an input integer, and its value depends on the user's input. Therefore, `word` could still be "zz", "aay", or "aaa" depending on whether `n` is greater than 52, equal to 27, or neither, respectively.
