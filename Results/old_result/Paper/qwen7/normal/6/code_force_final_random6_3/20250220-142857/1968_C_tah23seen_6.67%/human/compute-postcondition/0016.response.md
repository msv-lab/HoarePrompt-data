Output State: **`i` is 6; `n` is the length of `arr` plus one; `ans[7]` is `arr[6] + ans[6]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i + 1]` to be the sum of `arr[i]` and `ans[i]`. Given that `i` is 6, `ans[7]` is set to `arr[6] + ans[6]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
