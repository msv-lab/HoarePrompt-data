Output State: **`max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing `[0, 0, i - 1]`, `i` is 0, `arr` is a non-empty list, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0, and the first segment's sum is greater than the maximum segment's sum.**

Explanation: The code appends a new segment to the `segments_variants` list. The segment being appended is `max_segment + [i - 1]`. Given that `max_segment` is `[0, 0]` and `i` is 0, the new segment becomes `[0, 0, -1]`. Since `i` is 0, `i - 1` evaluates to -1. All other variables remain unchanged.
