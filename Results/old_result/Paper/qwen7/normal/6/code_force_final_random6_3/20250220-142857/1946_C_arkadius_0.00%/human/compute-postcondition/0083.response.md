Output State: The stack contains a series of pairs \((u_i, False)\) where each \(u_i\) is a child vertex of \(v\) from the tree, and these pairs are added sequentially as the loop iterates over all children of \(v\).

In more detail, the stack will contain every child vertex of \(v\) paired with `False`, in the order they were processed during the loop's iterations. This means if there are \(n\) children of \(v\), the stack will end up containing \(n\) pairs, each of the form \((u_i, False)\), where \(u_i\) is one of the children of \(v\).
