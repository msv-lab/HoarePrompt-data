Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `num` which is being iterated over from the list `arr`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - The loop condition is based on the existence of elements in `arr`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `arr` must have at least one element, and `num` is the current element being processed.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `num` is the current element being processed, it will be the first element of the next iteration's `arr`.
   - `arr` must have at least one element for the loop to continue. After processing the current `num`, `arr` will have one less element (if it had more than one element initially).

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `test_cases` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `count` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `mod_y_map` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `mod_y_key` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `mod_x_key` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `mod_y` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `mod_x_map` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

The only state that needs to be adjusted is `arr`, which will now have one less element if it originally had more than one element.

**State:**
- `test_cases` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple.
- Each tuple must have exactly four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
- `arr` must have at least one element, and the current `num` is the first element of the next iteration's `arr`.
- `count` is `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1`.
- `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary with one additional entry where `mod_y_key` maps to `mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1`.
- `mod_y_key` is `num % y`.
- `mod_x_key` is `num % x`.
- `mod_y` is `num % y`.
- `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, each tuple must have exactly four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and `arr` must have at least one element, `count` is `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1`, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary with one additional entry where `mod_y_key` maps to `mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` is incremented by 1, and `arr` must have at least one element, and the current `num` is the first element of the next iteration's `arr`.**
