Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that the expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
- The provided solution simply prints \( y = x - 1 \) for each test case.
- Let's analyze whether this approach is correct:

  For any \( x \):
  - If \( y = x - 1 \), then \(\gcd(x, x-1) = 1\) because \( x \) and \( x-1 \) are consecutive integers and thus coprime.
  - Therefore, \(\gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = 1 + (x-1) = x\).

  This means that for any \( x \), choosing \( y = x - 1 \) results in the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\), which is \( x \).

Given this analysis, the provided solution is indeed correct because it always produces the maximum possible value for \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) by setting \( y = x - 1 \).

Correctness: **True**
