Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `number`, which is an integer, and `quantity`, which is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= quantity <= 2 * 10^5. Depending on the value of `quantity`, the function returns either the value of `number` or an error message indicating that the quantity is out of the allowed range.**
