The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\)), and `nums` (a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive). It processes the list `nums` by repeatedly removing the first and last elements, reducing `k` based on their minimum value, and updating the count of times the last element (`b`) was found to be non-positive. If `k` becomes zero or there are fewer than two elements left in `nums`, the function returns the count of non-positive `b` values plus one. If no operations were performed, it returns zero.
