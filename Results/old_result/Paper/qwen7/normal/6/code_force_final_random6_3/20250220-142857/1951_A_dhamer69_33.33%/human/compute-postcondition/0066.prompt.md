Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n == 2:
        if s == '00':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        count_1 = s.count('1')
        if count_1 % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif s.count('11') == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and if `n` equals 2, `s` is either equal to '00' or not equal to '00'. If `n` is not equal to 2, `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`. If the number of '1's is odd, the postcondition remains as is. If the number of '1's is even, the string `s` either contains exactly one occurrence of '11' or does not contain exactly one occurrence of '11'.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is `t-1`, `n` is an integer (assigned the value of `int(input())`), `s` is a string (updated to the value of the input string). If `n` equals 2, `s` is either equal to '00' or not equal to '00'. If `n` is not equal to 2, `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, and `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`; `t` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
