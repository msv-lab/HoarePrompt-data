Output State: **`remaining_cells` is updated to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or `screen_require_for_y + extra_screen` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` or `y // 2 + 2` if `y` is odd, `x` is updated to the first integer from the input split, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + x`, `y` is either even or odd, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `extra_space` is calculated as `space_x - remaining_cells`.**

In more natural language: The variable `remaining_cells` remains unchanged as it was previously defined. The variable `t` stays the same since no operation affects it. The variable `result` also remains unchanged as it was previously defined. The variable `x` is updated to the first integer from the input split, and `space_x` is set to `x`. The variable `total_space` is now `space_y + x`. The variable `y` and `screen_require_for_y` remain unchanged as they were previously defined. The variable `space_y` remains unchanged as it was previously defined. The variable `extra_space` is now calculated as `space_x - remaining_cells`.
