Output State: **`t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `a` is an integer equal to the first element of `info`, `b` must be a positive integer, `suma` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1**

Explanation: The variable `x` is calculated using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. Given that `i` is 1, the formula simplifies to `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1 ** 2 + 1`, which further simplifies to `a // 1 + 1`, resulting in `a + 1`. Since `a` is the first element of `info`, `x` is `a + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
