Output State: **`x` is 0, `a` is equal to the original value of `b`, `b` is equal to the original value of `a`, `n` must be greater than 0.**

In the code snippet, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped. So, `a` now holds the value that `b` originally had, and `b` now holds the value that `a` originally had. The other variables, `x` and `n`, remain unchanged. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
