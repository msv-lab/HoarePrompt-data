Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Initialization and Calculation of `values` and `sum_values`:**
   - The `values` and `sum_values` lists are initialized to length 10, but the problem involves numbers up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\). This means the lists should be much longer to accommodate all possible digit sums.
   - The logic for calculating the sum of digits and updating `values` and `sum_values` is flawed. Specifically, the code tries to use the last digit and the integer formed by the remaining digits to compute the sum of digits, which is not the correct approach.

2. **Sum Calculation for Numbers Greater Than 10:**
   - The code attempts to calculate the sum of digits for numbers greater than 10 by splitting the number into its last digit and the remaining part. However, this approach does not correctly handle the sum of digits for multi-digit numbers.
   - For example, for `n = 12`, the correct sum of digits is `1 + 2 = 3`, but the code incorrectly handles this.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Sum Calculation:**
   - The logic inside the loop for `i` from 10 to `n` is incorrect. It does not properly compute the sum of digits for each number and update the `values` and `sum_values` lists accordingly.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
