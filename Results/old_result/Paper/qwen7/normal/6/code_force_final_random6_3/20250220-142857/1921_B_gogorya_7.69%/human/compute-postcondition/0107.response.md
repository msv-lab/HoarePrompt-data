Postcondition: `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - 4` or `a1 - a2 - 3`, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + 2` or `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `hd` is greater than 0, then the conditions for `hd` and `res` remain as specified in the if part. If `hd` is not greater than 0, the conditions do not change.
