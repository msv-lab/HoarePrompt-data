Output State: **`n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `t` is one less than its previous value.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().strip()` takes the current value of `a` (which is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace), and overwrites `a` with a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. The other variables (`n`, `b`, `c`, `results`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
