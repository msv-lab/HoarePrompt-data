Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `res` is a list with `n` elements all set to 1 if `k` equals `n`, otherwise `res` is a range object representing numbers from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, otherwise `res` is a list with a single element `-1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` based on the conditions involving `k` and `n`. If `k` equals `n`, `res` becomes a list with `n` elements all set to 1. If `k` equals 1, `res` becomes a range object representing numbers from 0 to `n-1`. Otherwise, `res` becomes a list with a single element `-1`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
