Postcondition: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is a non-negative integer decreased by 3, `n` must be at least 1, `ans` is equal to `ans` plus `dif` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `k` is either decreased by `dif * (i + 1)` or set to 0, `dif` is the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`.
