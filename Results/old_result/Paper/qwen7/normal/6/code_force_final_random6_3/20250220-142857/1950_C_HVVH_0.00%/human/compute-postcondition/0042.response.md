Output State: **`day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `h` is `h - 12`, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `h = h - 12` subtracts 12 from the value of `h`. The value of `m` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM' and is not impacted by the code.
