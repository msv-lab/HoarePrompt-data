Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. This value is the number of test cases, which is represented by the variable `t`.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will execute based on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is valid according to the given constraints: \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `t` is within the specified range.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
