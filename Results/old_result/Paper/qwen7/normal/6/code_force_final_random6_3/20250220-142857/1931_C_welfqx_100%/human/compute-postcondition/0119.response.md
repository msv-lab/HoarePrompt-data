Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 3.

4. **Check the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, `n - 1` must be greater than 3, which means `n` must be greater than 4.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 4.
   - `n` must remain greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 4**
