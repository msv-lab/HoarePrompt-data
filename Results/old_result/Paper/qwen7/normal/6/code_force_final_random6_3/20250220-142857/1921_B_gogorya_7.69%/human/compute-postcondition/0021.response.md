Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `hd` is -1, and `res` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `hd` is decremented by 1. Since `hd` was initially 0, after executing `hd -= 1`, `hd` becomes -1. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `res`) remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
