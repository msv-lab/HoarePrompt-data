Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input string, `n` is the number of elements in `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cost` by adding `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged. `sum(N)` calculates the sum of all elements in list `N`, which contains the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`. The term `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` represents the sum of the first `n-1` natural numbers multiplied by `m^2`, and `n * m * mu` is the product of `n`, `m`, and `mu`. The output state includes all the variables from the initial state, with `cost` updated according to the given formula.
