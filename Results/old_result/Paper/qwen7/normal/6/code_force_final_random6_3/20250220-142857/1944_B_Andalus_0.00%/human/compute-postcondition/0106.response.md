Output State: **`sz` is 0, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable, and the condition `sz >= k` is true and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `sz` or `rdb`, nor does it affect the condition `sz >= k`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, the values of `sz` and `rdb` remain unchanged, and the condition `sz >= k` remains true.
