You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

#Function 1:

    if x < 0:
        return -1
    inx = bl(a, x)

#Function 2:

    left = [0]
    last = [-1]
    ans = [-1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
            last.append(i)
        else:
            last.append(last[-1])
    for i in a:
        left.append(left[-1] + i)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
            ans[i] = 1
            continue
        x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
        inx = func_1(left, x)
        inx2 = last[i - 1]
        if inx2 < inx:
            inx = inx2
        if inx < 0:
            continue
        ans[i] = i + 1 - inx
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes a list `a` containing `n` integers (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5) and an integer `n` representing the number of elements in the list. It constructs two auxiliary lists: `last`, which stores the last occurrence index of each unique element in `a`, and `left`, which contains the cumulative sums of the elements in `a`. Finally, it computes a result list `ans` based on certain conditions involving these auxiliary lists. The function returns `ans`, which likely indicates the number of operations needed to transform each element in `a` into the smallest possible value through specific operations defined by the conditions.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten. Specifically, the program uses `func_1` and `func_2` to attempt to solve the problem, but these functions do not accurately reflect the rules described in the problem statement.

The core issue lies in how the program handles the conditions under which a slime can eat another slime. According to the problem description, a slime can only eat a neighbor if it is strictly larger than that neighbor. However, the program does not properly account for this condition in `func_2`.

For instance, consider the input:
```
5
2 2 3 1 1
```
The correct output should be:
```
2 1 -1 1 2
```
However, the program will incorrectly compute the results because it does not correctly handle the condition where a slime cannot eat a smaller or equal-sized neighbor.

Here’s a more detailed breakdown of the issue:
- In the example, the third slime (size 3) can eat the second slime (size 2) in 1 second, but the program might not correctly compute this.
- Similarly, the fifth slime (size 1) cannot eat the fourth slime (size 1) because they are of equal size, but the program might incorrectly compute that the fifth slime can eat the fourth slime.

Thus, the program fails to correctly simulate the process of slimes eating each other according to the given rules, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.
