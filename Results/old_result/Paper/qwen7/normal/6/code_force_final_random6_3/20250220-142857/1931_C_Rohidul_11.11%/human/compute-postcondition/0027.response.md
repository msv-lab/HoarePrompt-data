Output State: `st` is equal to the number of consecutive identical elements at the beginning of the list, `end` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `l` is the index right after the last pair of identical elements found, and `r` is `n - 1`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `st` will still hold the count of consecutive identical elements at the start of the list. `end` will be incremented by the number of times the loop executed, which is determined by how many times the condition `r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]` was true. `l` will be the index right after the last pair of identical elements found during the entire loop execution, and `r` remains as `n - 1` because it was not changed inside the loop.
