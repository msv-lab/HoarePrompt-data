The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters:
- `n`: an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `q`: an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5.
- `operations`: a list of n lists, each containing two integers `b` and `x` where `b` ∈ {1, 2} and 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^9.
- `queries`: a list of q integers `k_i` where 1 ≤ `k_i` ≤ min(10^18, c) and c is the size of the array after performing all n operations.

The function processes `n` operations on an array and then answers `q` queries based on the final state of the array after all operations are applied. The functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept these parameters and perform the specified operations on the array, then return the results for the given queries.
