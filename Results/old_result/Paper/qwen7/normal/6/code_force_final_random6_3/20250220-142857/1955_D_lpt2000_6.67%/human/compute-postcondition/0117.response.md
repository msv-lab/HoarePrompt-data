Postcondition: `aa` must have at least `n` elements, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` each have at least 1 element. `D[out_aa]` remains unchanged. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1 under specific conditions (either `D[in_aa]` is greater than 0 and `C[in_aa]` equals `D[in_aa]` leading to an additional increment, or `D[in_aa]` is greater than 0 and the specified conditions on `E[out_aa]` are met). Otherwise, `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged, `D[out_aa]` remains unchanged, and `E[out_aa]` remains unchanged.
