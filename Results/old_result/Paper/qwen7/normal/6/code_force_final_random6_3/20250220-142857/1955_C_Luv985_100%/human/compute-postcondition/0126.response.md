Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element has been converted to an integer using `map(lambda x: int(x), a)`, `l` must be 1, `r` must be `n - 2`, `ans` is either `ans + 1` or 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `t` is `k % 2` if `k` is greater than 0; `t` is updated to `k % 2`.**

Explanation: The line `t = k % 2` updates the value of `t` to be the remainder when `k` is divided by 2. However, since the value of `k` itself is not altered by this line of code, the condition that `k` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. All other variables and their conditions remain the same as the initial state.
