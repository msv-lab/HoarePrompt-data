Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is less than or equal to 3, `a[3]` exists and its value is used to index `r`, the element at that index in `r` is now 0, `ur` is 2, and `ul` is equal to `ur` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block without changing the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `a[3]`, the indexed element in `r`, `ur`, and `ul` remain unchanged. We also note that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
