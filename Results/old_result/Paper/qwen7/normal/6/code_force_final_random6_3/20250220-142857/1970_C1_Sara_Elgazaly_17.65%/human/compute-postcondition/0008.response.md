Output State: **`x` must be at least 2, `a` is the first integer entered by the user, `b` is the second integer entered by the user, `lst[a]` now contains the value `[b]`.**

Explanation: The code `lst[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list located at index `a` in the list `lst`. Initially, `lst[b]` contains the value `[a]`, which means `lst` is at least a list with at least `b+1` elements, and the element at index `b` is a list containing the single element `a`. After executing the code, the element at index `a` in `lst` will contain the list `[b]`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
