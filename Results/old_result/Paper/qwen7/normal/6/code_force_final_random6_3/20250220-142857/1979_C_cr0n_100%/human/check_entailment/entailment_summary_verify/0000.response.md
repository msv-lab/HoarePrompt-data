### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function `func_2` step-by-step to verify the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)
```
This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b`.

#### Function `func_2`:
```python
def func_2():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    den = vals[0]
    for x in vals:
        den = func_1(den, x)
    vprod = [den // r for r in vals]
    den = den - sum(vprod)
    if den <= 0:
        print(-1)
        return
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
```
1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the number of outcomes `N` and a list of multipliers `vals`.
2. **Calculating LCM**: It initializes `den` with the first element of `vals` and iteratively updates `den` to be the LCM of `den` and each subsequent element in `vals`.
3. **Distributing Coins**: It calculates a list `vprod` where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding multiplier in `vals`.
4. **Checking Condition**: It checks if `den` minus the sum of `vprod` is less than or equal to zero. If so, it prints `-1` and returns. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod`.

#### Analysis:
- **LCM Calculation**: The LCM calculation ensures that the total bet is a common multiple of all multipliers. This is crucial because it allows us to evenly distribute the bets while ensuring the total bet is minimized.
- **Distribution Logic**: The distribution logic in `vprod` ensures that the total bet is spread across all outcomes in a way that the total bet is a fraction of the LCM. This fraction is adjusted by subtracting the sum of `vprod` from `den`.
- **Condition Check**: The condition check ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any winning outcome. If `den` is reduced to a non-positive value, it means the total bet cannot be distributed in a way that meets the requirement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to ensure the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any winning outcome. The original assessment incorrectly identified a flaw that does not exist in the provided code.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided function summaries.
