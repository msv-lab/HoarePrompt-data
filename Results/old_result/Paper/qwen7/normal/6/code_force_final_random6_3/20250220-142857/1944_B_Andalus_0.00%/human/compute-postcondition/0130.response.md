Postcondition: `sz` is either 2 or 4. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is set to 4, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one fewer element than before, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k - sz` is less than 2, then `sz` remains 2, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one fewer element than before, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
