Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input string, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `N` has `n` elements, and the current value of `n * m` equals `k`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**.

This means that the cost is calculated using the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, where `sum(N)` is the sum of the first `q` elements of `M`, and `n` is the number of elements in `N`. All other variables retain their previous states.
