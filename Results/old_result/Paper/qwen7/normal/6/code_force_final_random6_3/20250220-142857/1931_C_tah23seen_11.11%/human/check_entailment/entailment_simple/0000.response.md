Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. It reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`arr`).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function starts by initializing two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It then iterates through the array to find the first pair of elements that are different (`arr[i] != arr[j]`). This ensures that the subarray `[i, j]` is the longest subarray where all elements are the same.
   - If such a subarray is found, the function returns the length of this subarray, which is `(j - i + 1)`. This is because changing all elements in this subarray to any value would require a cost of `(j - i + 1)` burles.
   - If no such subarray is found (i.e., all elements are the same), the function returns `0`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where the entire array is already uniform (all elements are the same). In this case, it correctly returns `0`.
   - The function also handles the case where the subarray identified by `i` and `j` spans the entire array, ensuring that the cost calculation is accurate.

4. **Output**:
   - The function correctly outputs the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal.

Given the logic and the handling of edge cases, the provided code appears to be correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
