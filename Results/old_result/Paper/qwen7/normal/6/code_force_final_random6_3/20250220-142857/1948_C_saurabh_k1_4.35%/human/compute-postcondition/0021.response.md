Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer reduced by 1, `b` is a list of strings obtained from new input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(str, input()))` takes a new input and converts each character of the input into a string, then assigns this list of strings to `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
