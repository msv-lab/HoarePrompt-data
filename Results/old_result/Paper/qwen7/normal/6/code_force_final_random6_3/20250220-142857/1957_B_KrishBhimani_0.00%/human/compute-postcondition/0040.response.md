Output State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is 3, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list with three elements where the first element is `k0 - (k0 - sum(ans) + 1)`, the second element is 1, and the third element is `k0 - sum(ans)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or if statement it is inside. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged.
