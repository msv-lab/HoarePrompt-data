Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is simply `for _ in range(n):`. There are no explicitly declared variables in the loop head, but we need to consider the variables that are modified within the loop.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop does not modify any variables directly in its header. Instead, it iterates `n` times. Each iteration of the loop does not change the values of `day`, `h`, or `m`.

3. **Determine the initial state before the loop**: The initial state is given as:
   - `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM'
   - `h` is an input integer
   - `m` is an input integer

4. **Determine the state after the loop**: Since the loop does not modify `day`, `h`, or `m`, these variables remain unchanged after each iteration. The only thing that changes is the number of iterations completed, which is represented by the loop counter `_`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be decremented by 1. However, since the loop counter `_` is an implicit variable, we do not need to adjust it explicitly. We only need to ensure that the conditions for `day`, `h`, and `m` remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

**State: **`day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `h` is an input integer, and `m` is an input integer**
