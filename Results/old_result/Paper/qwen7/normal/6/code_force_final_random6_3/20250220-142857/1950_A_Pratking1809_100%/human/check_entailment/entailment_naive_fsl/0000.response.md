Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not handle the case when `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal. According to the problem description, if `a == b == c`, the output should be "NONE". However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario. For example, if the input is `0 0 0`, the program will output "STAIR" instead of "NONE". This is a clear violation of the problem description.
