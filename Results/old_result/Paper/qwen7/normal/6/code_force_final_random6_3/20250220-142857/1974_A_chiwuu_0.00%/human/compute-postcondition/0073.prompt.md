You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = input().split()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = int(b)
        
        t = b * 2
        
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        
        print(t)
        
    #State: Output State: The final value of `t` after the loop has executed all its iterations will depend on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each iteration. After the loop completes, `t` will be updated based on the conditions provided within the loop body. Specifically, `t` is initially set to `b * 2`, then adjusted according to the following rules:
    #
    #1. If `t % 5 == 0`, `t` is set to `t // 5`.
    #2. Otherwise, `t` is set to `t // 5 + 1`.
    #3. Then, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
    #4. If `t1 >= a`, `t` remains unchanged.
    #5. Otherwise, `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.
    #6. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15`.
    #7. Otherwise, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15 + 1`.
    #
    #After all iterations, `t` will reflect the cumulative effect of these updates based on the inputs provided for each iteration of the loop. The exact value of `t` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each iteration, but it will be the result of applying the above logic iteratively for `n` times.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y`. For each test case, if `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, it processes the values of `x` and `y` which are integers between 0 and 99, and returns different outputs based on specific conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
