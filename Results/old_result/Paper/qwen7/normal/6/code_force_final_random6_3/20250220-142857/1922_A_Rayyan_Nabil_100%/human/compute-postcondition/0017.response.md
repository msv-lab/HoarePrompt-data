Output State: **`n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `t` is one less than its previous value, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

In this step, the code updates the value of `b` to be the stripped input string. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `t` is decreased by 1.
