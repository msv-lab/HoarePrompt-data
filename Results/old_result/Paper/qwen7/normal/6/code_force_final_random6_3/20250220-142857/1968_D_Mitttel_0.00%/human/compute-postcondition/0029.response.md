Output State: **`index` is 17 + 3 * n, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]` using `map(int, ...)` and `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, data[index:index + n])`, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `a` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from `map(int, data[index:index + n])`.**

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1` with the arguments `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`, and assigns its return value to the variable `result`. This updates the `results` list to contain this return value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
