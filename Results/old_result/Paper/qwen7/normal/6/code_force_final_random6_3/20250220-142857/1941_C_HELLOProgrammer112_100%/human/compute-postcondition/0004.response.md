Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.**

The code `y = s.count('pie')` calculates the number of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `y`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
