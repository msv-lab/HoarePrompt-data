Output State: **`data[idx]` is converted to an integer and assigned to `n`, `results` contains a string representation of `ans` appended to it, `cnt` is increased by `v[i]` for each `i` in the range `[3, n + 1)`, `ans` is updated according to the formulae provided in the loop body for each `i` in the same range, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. No other variables are directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `data[idx]`, `results`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged from their previous states, except that `idx` is now one more than its previous value.
