Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets, s is updated to the input string.**

The code `s = input()` reads a string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets is maintained, but now `s` is updated to the input string provided by the user.
