Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted).
   - `n` is an input integer (this remains unchanged).
   - `i` is 2.

4. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - Therefore, the loop will continue if `2 < n + 1`, which simplifies to `n > 1`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `t` remains greater than 0 (unchanged).
   - `n` remains an input integer (unchanged).
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 3**
