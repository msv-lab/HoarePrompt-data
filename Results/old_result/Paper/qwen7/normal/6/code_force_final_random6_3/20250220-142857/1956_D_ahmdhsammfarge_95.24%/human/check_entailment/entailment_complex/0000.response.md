Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is supposed to find the pair of indices `(r, l)` that maximizes the sum of the elements of the array excluding those indices plus a quadratic term based on the distance between the indices. However, the implementation hardcodes `r` and `l` to 2 and 5, respectively, regardless of the input list. This means it does not actually perform the intended calculation and instead returns fixed values.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function is called recursively and appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list. However, the function does not seem to have a clear purpose or logic beyond appending the same operation repeatedly. This suggests that the function might not be contributing meaningfully to the solution.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function is responsible for updating the array `lst` by setting the elements from index `r` to `l` to the value `r - l + 1`. It also appends operations to the `ops` list. The function correctly performs the operation and updates the list, but the recursive calls to `func_2` without a clear purpose suggest that the function might not be used effectively.

Given the above observations, the overall program does not correctly solve the problem. The hardcoded values in `func_1` mean that the function does not find the optimal pair of indices to maximize the sum of the array elements. Additionally, the recursive calls in `func_2` without a clear purpose and the redundant operations in `func_3` suggest that the program is not designed to find the maximum sum efficiently.

Therefore, the given program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
