Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sz` is 0, `i` will be `n`, `n` remains unchanged, and `rdb` will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt`.
Code of the loop:
for elem in ldb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ldb` is a non-empty list, and if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, the size of `ldb` (sz) is increased by 2. Otherwise, the size of `ldb` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ldb` is a non-empty list, and the size of `ldb` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is increased by 2. Otherwise, the size of `ldb` and `sz` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ldb` is a non-empty list with the same size as it was at the end of the previous iteration. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is increased by 2. Otherwise, the size of `ldb` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
