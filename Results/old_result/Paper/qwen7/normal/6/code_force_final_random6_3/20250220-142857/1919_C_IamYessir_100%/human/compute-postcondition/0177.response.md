Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` minus 1, and `s` is the count of consecutive elements in list `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, and the input value `n` is an integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer. The values of `i` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state. The input value is stored in the variable `n`.
