Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (the starting value for the `range(n)` function).
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Therefore, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 so that the loop can start executing.
   - The variable `i` should be set to its initial value, which is 0.

5. **Consider other variables**:
   - Variables like `cnt`, `a`, `tmp`, and `ans` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly. They can remain as they are.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is equal to `n`**
