Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Initialization and Calculation Errors**: The program incorrectly initializes `k` and does not correctly handle the initial product calculation. It should start with the full product of the array modulo `m`.

2. **Loop Direction and Indexing**: The loop for calculating the product in reverse direction is incorrect. It should start from the end of the array and work its way towards the beginning, updating the product and indices correctly.

3. **Edge Cases Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the string `s` consists only of 'L' or 'R'. It also does not correctly manage the removal of elements from the array.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        t = input()

        # Calculate the initial product of the array modulo m
        product = 1
        for num in a:
            product = (product * num) % m

        result = []
        for cmd in t:
            if cmd == 'L':
                product = (product * pow(a.pop(0), -1, m)) % m
            elif cmd == 'R':
                product = (product * pow(a.pop(), -1, m)) % m
            result.append(product)

        print(*result)


# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version:
- Initializes the product correctly.
- Uses modular inverse (`pow(num, -1, m)`) to handle division in modular arithmetic.
- Correctly handles the removal of elements from the array based on the command.
- Ensures the product is updated correctly after each operation.
