Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive.
   - `i` is 49.
   - `n` is 49.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition is `while t`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `t` must be true.
   - Since `t` is an integer between 0 and 49, inclusive, the only way for the loop to continue is if `t` is non-zero (i.e., `t > 0`).

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we need to ensure that `t` is non-zero.
   - Given that `t` is an integer between 0 and 49, inclusive, and we need it to be non-zero for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

5. **Final State**:
   - The states that need to be adjusted are those related to `t`.
   - After all iterations, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state after the previous iteration should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
