Output State: **`arr` is a list containing [1, 4, 8], `i` is 9, `c` is `n`, `ans` is a list with the value `k0 - sum(ans) + 1 << i` and `[0] * (n - len(ans))` appended, `k0` is `k`, `n` is 8, `k` is 0.**

Explanation: The list `arr` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the given code snippet. The variable `i` is set to 9, which is the value it had just before the loop ended. The variable `c` remains as `n`, which is the integer obtained from the first element of `l1`. Since `k` is 0, the loop condition is no longer met, and the list `ans` is updated according to the given expression. The value of `n` is 8, which is the first element of `l1`.
