Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer such that `n > 1`, and the left value at index `i` (`lft[i]`) is not equal to the left value at index `i - 1` (`lft[i - 1]`). Additionally, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and the left value at index `i` (`lft[i]`) is not equal to the left value at index `i + 1` (`lft[i + 1]`), then `sng` is a list with the element `lft[i]` appended to it.**
