The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `bets`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `bets`. If `i` is less than `bets`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. Additionally, `bets` must be greater than 0 for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is 1, `bets` must be greater than 1**
