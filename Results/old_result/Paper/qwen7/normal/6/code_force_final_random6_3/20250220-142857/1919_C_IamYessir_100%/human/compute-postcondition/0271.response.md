Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b`; `n` must be at least 1; `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`; `a` is updated by appending `b[i]` to it.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(b[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `b` to list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
