Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop runs from `i` to `2 * n - 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.

4. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` was equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, but since `i` is now `n + 1`, the next increment will be `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same (an integer between 1 and 5000).
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented by 1, where `i` is now `n + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**.
