To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic and steps taken in the `func_2` function to find a Hamiltonian path.

### Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `path` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `remaining_vertices` is a set containing all vertices from 1 to n.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues until `remaining_vertices` is empty.
   - For each degree `d` from `n-1` down to 0:
     - A query is made using `func_1(d)`.
     - The response `(v, u)` is obtained.
     - If `v` is 0, it means no vertex with the current degree `d` exists, and the loop continues to the next degree.
     - If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it is added to the `path` and removed from `remaining_vertices`.

3. **Output**:
   - Once all vertices are processed, the `path` is printed as a Hamiltonian path.

### Key Points to Verify:

1. **Query Handling**:
   - The function correctly handles the query and extracts the necessary information.
   - It ensures that the vertex `v` with the minimum degree is selected when multiple vertices have the same degree.

2. **Path Construction**:
   - The function ensures that each vertex is visited exactly once by removing it from `remaining_vertices` after it is added to the path.
   - The loop continues to find the next vertex with the minimum degree, ensuring a Hamiltonian path is constructed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where no vertex with the current degree `d` is found by continuing to the next lower degree.
   - It ensures that the path is constructed in a way that respects the constraints of the problem.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to follow the correct approach to construct a Hamiltonian path using the allowed queries. The logic is sound and should work as intended within the constraints of the problem.

### Final Answer:

**Correctness: True**
