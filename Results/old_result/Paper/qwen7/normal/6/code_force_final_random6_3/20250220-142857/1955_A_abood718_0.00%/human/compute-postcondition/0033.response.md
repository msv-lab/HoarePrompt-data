Step-by-step reasoning:

1. We start with the initial state where:
   - `i` is `i_prev + 1`
   - `A` is an input integer
   - `B` is an input integer
   - `C` is an input integer
   - `X` is defined as `A // 2`

2. The `print(X)` statement will print the value of `X`.

3. According to the initial state, `X` is calculated as `A // 2`, which means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the integer result of dividing `A` by 2.

Output: **X (where X is the integer division of A by 2)**
