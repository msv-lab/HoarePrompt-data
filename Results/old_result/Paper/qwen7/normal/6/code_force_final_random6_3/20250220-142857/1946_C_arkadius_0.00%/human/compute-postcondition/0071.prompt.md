Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `stack` will contain tuples of all the vertices in the subtree rooted at `v`, with their second element set to `False`. The condition `(postorder)` is true.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
    if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
        tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
    else:
        tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `stack` will contain tuples of all the vertices in the subtree rooted at `v`, with their second element set to `False`, (postorder) is true. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is equal to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` plus `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`, and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `stack` contains tuples of all the vertices in the subtree rooted at `v`, with their second element set to `False`, `(postorder)` is true, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated by adding 1 to its current value if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x` for any `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, otherwise `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated by adding `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for each `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for each `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`. The state of `tree.vertices[u]` for each `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by either 1 (if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`) or by `tree.vertices[u].good_components'` (if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`). `tree.vertices[u].good_components'` remains unchanged. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size'` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` if the condition in the if statement is false.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
