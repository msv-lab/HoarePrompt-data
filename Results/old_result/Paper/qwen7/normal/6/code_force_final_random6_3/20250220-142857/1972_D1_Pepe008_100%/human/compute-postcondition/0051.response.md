Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `b` must be a positive integer
   - `x` is 1
   - The postcondition for the loop body is that if `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is greater than 0, then `suma` is 2. Otherwise, the value of `suma` remains unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = b`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - The value of `b` must remain the same as it is a loop bound and does not change within the loop.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `b` must still be a positive integer.
   - `x` remains unchanged and is still 1.
   - The value of `suma` remains unchanged based on the postcondition from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is 2, `b` must be a positive integer, `x` is 1, `suma` remains unchanged**.
