Output State: **`ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is equal to the previous value of `sz` + 1, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `lft` is a slice of `lst` containing the first `n` elements, `rgt` is a slice of `lst` containing the remaining elements starting from the `n+1` index.**

Explanation: The line `sng = []` creates an empty list named `sng`. This does not affect the values of `ldb`, `sz`, `rdb`, `lft`, or `rgt`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states.
