Output State: **`x` is 0, `a` is equal to `l[x]`, `b` is equal to the original value of `a`, `n` remains unchanged, and `l[x]` is greater than `b`.**

Explanation: The code `a = l[x]` assigns the value of `l[x]` to `a`. Since `x` is 0, `a` is now equal to `l[0]`. This changes the value of `a`, making it equal to `l[0]`. According to the initial state, `b` was originally equal to the value of `a`, so `b` is now equal to `l[0]` as well. All other variables remain unchanged, including `n` which must be less than or equal to 0 and remains unchanged. Additionally, `l[x]` (which is now `a` and `b`) is greater than `b` (which is also `a`).
