Output State: **`arr` is an empty list, `i` is the last element of the original `arr`, `c` is equal to the new input value + 2, `ans` is a list with elements as specified and extended by 0s to match the new length of `n`, `n` is an integer obtained from splitting the last element of `l1` and converting it to an integer, `k` is an integer obtained from splitting the second last element of `l1` and converting it to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `arr = []` assigns an empty list to `arr`. This operation changes the state of `arr` to an empty list. The values of `i`, `c`, `ans`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.
