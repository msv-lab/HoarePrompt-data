Output State: **`cn` is incremented by `ck`, `n` is an input integer, `onum` is a list of integers, `ck` is incremented by 1 each time `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1] until a pair of consecutive elements are not equal or the end of the list is reached, and if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is further incremented by `ck`, `r` is `previous_r + 1`, and `r` must be less than `t`; `f` is 1, `num` is updated to a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code takes a list of integers as input using `input().split()`, which splits the input string into individual elements and converts them to integers. This list is then assigned to the variable `num`. The other variables (`cn`, `n`, `onum`, `ck`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `r`, `t`, and `f`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
