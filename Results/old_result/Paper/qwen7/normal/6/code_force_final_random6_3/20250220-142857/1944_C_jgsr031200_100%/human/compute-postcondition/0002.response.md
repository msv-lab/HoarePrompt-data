Output State: **`freq[i]` is increased by 1.**

The code `freq[i] += 1` increments the value of `freq[i]` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `freq[i]`, we only know that its value has been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
