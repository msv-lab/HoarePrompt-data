Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `n-2` to `-1` in reverse order. This means `i` starts at `n-3` (as given) and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `-1`.

3. **Determine the New Value of `i`**: Since `i` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i - 1`.

4. **Check the Loop Continuation Condition**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than or equal to `-1`. However, since `i` starts at `n-3` and decreases by 1, the loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

5. **Adjust the Other Variables**: The other variables (`k`, `t`, `a`, `q1`, `q2`, and `m`) are not directly affected by the loop itself but are updated within the loop body. We don't need to adjust their values here.

6. **State Adjustment**: Based on the above points, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`, and `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `n-4`, `n` must be greater than 2**.

This is because `i` is decreased by 1 from its previous value of `n-3`.
