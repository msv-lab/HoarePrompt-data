Output State: **`cou` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than -1, and the current value of `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions and values of the variables from the initial state are still valid after the execution of the `continue` statement.
