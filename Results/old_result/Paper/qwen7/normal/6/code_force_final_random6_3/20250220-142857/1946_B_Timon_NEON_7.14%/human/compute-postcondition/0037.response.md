Output State: **`max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is [arr[3], 3], `max_segment` is either [0, 0] or [1, 0] or [arr[1], 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing `[0, 0, 2]` or `[new_segment + [2]]` or an empty list, `i` is 4, `arr` is a non-empty list**

Explanation: The code updates `new_segment` to be `[arr[i], i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `new_segment` becomes `[arr[3], 3]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
