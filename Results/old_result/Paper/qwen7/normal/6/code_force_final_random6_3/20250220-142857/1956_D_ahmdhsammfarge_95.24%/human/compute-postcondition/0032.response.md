Output State: **`i` remains 1, `j` becomes 3, `sm` remains unchanged, `over_sum` remains unchanged, `r` and `l` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The given code snippet does not specify any changes to the variables `i`, `j`, `sm`, `over_sum`, `r`, or `l`. The state of these variables remains the same as their initial conditions. Specifically, `i` remains 1, `j` becomes 3, and `sm`, `over_sum`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged because no operations are performed on them in the provided code snippet.
