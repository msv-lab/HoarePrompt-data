Output State: **`T` must be a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 5000, `_` is now 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `lst` by taking a single line of space-separated integers as input, splitting the input string into individual elements, and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `T`, `_`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
