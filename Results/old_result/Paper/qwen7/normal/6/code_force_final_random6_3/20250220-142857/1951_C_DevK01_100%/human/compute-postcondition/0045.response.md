Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `L` is updated to a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a list of integers from the input string, `n` is the length of `L`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`**.

Explanation: The code `M = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `M`. The other variables (`t`, `L`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, and `N`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The length of `L` (`n`) and the third element of `L` (`k`) are still valid, and `m` remains the minimum value between its original value and `k`. The value of `q` is still the ceiling value of `k / m`, and `N` is still a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`.
