Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `n` is not equal to 2, `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`.**

Explanation: The code `count_1 = s.count('1')` counts the number of times the character '1' appears in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `count_1`. None of the other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, or `s`) are affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
