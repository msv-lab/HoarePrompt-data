State: **`first` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. The initial value of `first` is False, but this does not directly affect whether the loop can execute.
3. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 because `range(n)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
4. The variable `i` starts at 0 when the loop begins, as `range(n)` starts counting from 0.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `n`.
