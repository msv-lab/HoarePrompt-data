Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `ans` will hold the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop's execution. The variable `cnt` will be reset to 0 at the start of each iteration of the loop, and it will be incremented by 1 each time the element at the current index `i` in the list `a` is equal to `tmp`. The variable `tmp` remains unchanged as it is only initialized once and compared against elements in the list `a`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n - 1` after the loop completes, as the loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is used to define the range of the loop. The variable `a` remains the same list of integers provided as input. The variable `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, and `cnt` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration. The final value of `ans` is the smallest value that `cnt` took on during any iteration where the condition `a[i] != tmp` was true.

In summary, `ans` will be the minimum count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp`, and all other variables will retain their states as described above.
