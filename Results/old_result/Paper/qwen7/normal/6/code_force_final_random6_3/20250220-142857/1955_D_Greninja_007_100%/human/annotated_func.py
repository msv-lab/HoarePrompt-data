#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, and b is a list of m integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive.
def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(sorted(b))
    ca = Counter(sorted(a[:m]))
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if (sm >= k) :
        ans += 1
    #State: `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of elements present in both `ca` and `cb`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
    for r in range(m, n):
        if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
            sm += 1
        
        ca[a[r]] += 1
        
        if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
            sm -= 1
        
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
        
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ca[a[r - m]]` is decremented by 1, `sm` is 0, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `ans` is increased by 1 for every iteration where `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `ca[a[r - m]]` will have been decremented by 1 for each element `a[r - m]` encountered during the loop. The variable `sm` will be 0 because it is reset to 0 after each full cycle through the loop (since `sm` is adjusted based on the comparison between `ca[a[r - m]]` and `cb[a[r - m]]`, and this comparison is part of the loop). The variable `m` will still be less than or equal to `n` as it is not modified within the loop. Finally, `ans` will be the total count of iterations where `sm` was found to be greater than or equal to `k`.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is the total count of iterations where `sm` was found to be greater than or equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It returns the total count (`ans`) of iterations where the sum of the minimum counts of elements present in both sorted sublists `a[:m]` and `b` (denoted as `sm`) is greater than or equal to `k`.
