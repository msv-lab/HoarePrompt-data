Output State: **`count` is 0, `n` is the next value of the first element in `test_cases`, `x` is the next value of the second element in `test_cases`, `y` is the next value of the third element in `test_cases`, `arr` is the next value of the fourth element in `test_cases`, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The line `mod_x_map = {}` creates an empty dictionary named `mod_x_map`. This does not affect the values of `count`, `n`, `x`, `y`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
