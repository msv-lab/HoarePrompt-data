Output State: **The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in `res`. Since the loop has executed up to the third iteration, it implies that `res` initially contained at least three elements. After all iterations, `i` will be set to the third element in `res`, and the loop will stop. The `print` function will output the elements of `res` separated by spaces.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output will be the elements of the `res` list printed one after another, separated by spaces, starting from the first element up to the third element.
