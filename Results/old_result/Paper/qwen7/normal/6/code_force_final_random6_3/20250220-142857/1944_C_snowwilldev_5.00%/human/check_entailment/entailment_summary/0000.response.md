Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Objective Mismatch**: The goal of the game is to determine the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of the array `c` at the end of the game. However, the program does not construct the array `c` or compute the MEX of `c`. Instead, it simply counts the occurrences of each integer in the input array `a`.

2. **Game Logic Not Implemented**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. It does not account for Alice appending elements to `c` and deleting them from `a`, nor does it account for Bob only deleting elements from `a`.

3. **Output Mismatch**: The program outputs the index of the first integer that appears exactly once in the input array `a`. This is not the same as the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
