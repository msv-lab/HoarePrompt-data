Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `T` remains 0, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `g` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input().**

The code creates a list `a` by splitting the input string using spaces and converting each element to an integer. However, the values of the other variables (`T`, `n`, `k`, `g`, `i`, `l`) remain unchanged, and `bets` is also left as an input integer.
