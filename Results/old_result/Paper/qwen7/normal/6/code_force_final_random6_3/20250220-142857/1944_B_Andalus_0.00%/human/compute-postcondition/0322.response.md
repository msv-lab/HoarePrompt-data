Postcondition: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `ldb` contains the value of `lft[i]`. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains the value of `lft[i]`, and if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i] != lft[i + 1]`, the variable `sng` contains the element `lft[i]` appended to it. Otherwise, `ldb` and `sng` remain unchanged, and the condition `lft[i] != lft[i - 1]` holds true.
