Output State: `sng` is a non-empty sequence, `sz` is `k` + `len(sng)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

This means that after the loop executes all its iterations, `sz` will be equal to `k` plus the length of the sequence `sng`. The loop breaks once `sz` reaches or exceeds `k`, so `sz` will be exactly `k` plus the number of elements in `sng`.
