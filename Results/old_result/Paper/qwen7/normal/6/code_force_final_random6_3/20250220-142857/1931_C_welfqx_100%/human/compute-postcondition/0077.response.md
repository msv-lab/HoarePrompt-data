Output State: **`r` will be `t`, `ii` will be `n - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `cn` will be the count of consecutive identical elements starting from the beginning of the list `num` up to index `n-2` plus the count of consecutive identical elements encountered during the loop execution (`ck`), `num` is a list, `ck` will hold the count of consecutive identical elements encountered during the loop execution, and it will be incremented each time two consecutive elements in `num` are found to be identical until a pair of non-identical elements is encountered or the end of the list is reached, `symb1` and `symb2` are equal, `f` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `f = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `f`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `r`, `ii`, `n`, `cn`, `num`, `ck`, `symb1`, and `symb2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
