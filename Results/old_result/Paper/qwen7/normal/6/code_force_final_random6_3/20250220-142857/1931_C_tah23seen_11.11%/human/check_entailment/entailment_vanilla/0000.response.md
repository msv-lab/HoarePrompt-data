Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It calls `func_1(arr)` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
   - It starts by finding the first and last different elements in the array.
     - `i` is initialized to 0, and `j` is initialized to the last index of the array (`len(arr) - 1`).
     - It iterates through the array to find the first pair of different elements.
     - If all elements are the same (`i > j`), it returns 0.
   - After identifying the first pair of different elements, it checks if all elements between `i` and `j` are the same.
     - If they are, it means the entire array can be made uniform by setting all elements between `i` and `j` to the value of `arr[i]` or `arr[j]`.
     - If they are not, it calculates the cost of making all elements between `i` and `j` equal to either `arr[i]` or `arr[j]`.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost of making all elements between `i` and `j` equal to `arr[i]` is `j - i + 1`.
   - The cost of making all elements between `i` and `j` equal to `arr[j]` is also `j - i + 1`.
   - The function returns the minimum of these two costs.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation:**
   - The function only considers the cost of setting all elements between `i` and `j` to either `arr[i]` or `arr[j]`.
   - However, the problem requires finding the minimum cost to make all elements equal, which might involve setting all elements to a different value that minimizes the cost.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled:**
   - The function does not handle cases where the array already has all elements equal.
   - It does not consider the possibility of setting all elements to a different value that minimizes the cost.

### Example Test Case Analysis:
Let's consider the example test case `[4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1, 3]`:
- The function identifies the first pair of different elements at indices 0 and 3.
- It calculates the cost of setting all elements between 0 and 3 to either 4 or 7.
- The cost is `3 - 0 + 1 = 4`, but this might not be the optimal solution.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not account for the possibility of setting all elements to a different value that minimizes the cost. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
