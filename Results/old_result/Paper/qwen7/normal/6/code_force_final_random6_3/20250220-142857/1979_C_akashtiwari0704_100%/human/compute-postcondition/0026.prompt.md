Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `bets` is an input integer, `T` remains 0, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `g` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input(), `prod` is the least common multiple of all integers in list `a`, `sumo` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(bets):
    a[i] = prod // a[i]
    sumo += int(a[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sumo` is the original value plus `int(a[i])`, `bets` must be greater than 0, T remains 0, n remains unchanged, k remains unchanged, g remains unchanged, i remains unchanged, l remains unchanged, a is a list of integers where each element is updated to `prod // a[i]`, prod is the least common multiple of all integers in list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sumo` is the original value plus `int(a[i])` + `int(a[i])`, `bets` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `g` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, and `prod` is the least common multiple of all integers in list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sumo` is the original value plus `int(a[i])` + `int(a[i])` + `int(a[i])`, `bets` must be greater than `i`, `T` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `g` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, and `prod` is the least common multiple of all integers in list `a`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
