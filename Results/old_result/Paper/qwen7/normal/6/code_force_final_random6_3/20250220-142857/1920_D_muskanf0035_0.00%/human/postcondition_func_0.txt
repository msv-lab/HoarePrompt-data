The function processes a list of operations to modify an array and then generates a result list based on given queries. Specifically, it appends integers to or repeats elements in the array according to the operation type. After processing all operations, it creates a result list by indexing into the modified array using the provided queries, and finally returns an empty list since no elements are added to the result list during the process.
