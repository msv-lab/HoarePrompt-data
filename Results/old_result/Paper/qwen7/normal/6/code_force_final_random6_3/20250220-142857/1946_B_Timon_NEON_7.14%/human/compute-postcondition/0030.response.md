The code `max_segment = new_segment` assigns the value of `new_segment` to `max_segment`. Since `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list where the first element is increased by `arr[2]`, the value of `max_segment` will be the same as `new_segment`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list where the first element is increased by `arr[2]`, `max_segment` is either an empty list or a list where the first element is increased by `arr[2]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing `[0, 0, 2, 2]` or `[new_segment + [2], 2]` or an empty list, `i` is 4, `arr` is a non-empty list**
