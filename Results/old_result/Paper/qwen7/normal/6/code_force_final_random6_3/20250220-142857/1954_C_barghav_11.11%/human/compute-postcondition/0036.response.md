Postcondition: `i` is one more than the previous value, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is either equal to `n` (if `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus one) or equal to `m` (where `m` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`). `m` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
