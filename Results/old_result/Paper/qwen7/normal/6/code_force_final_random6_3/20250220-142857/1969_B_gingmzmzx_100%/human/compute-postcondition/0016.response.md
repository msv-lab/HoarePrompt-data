Output State: **`c` is the next character in `s`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, and `ans` and `zeroes` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count of the character `c` in the dictionary `cnt`. The other variables `ans` and `zeroes` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
