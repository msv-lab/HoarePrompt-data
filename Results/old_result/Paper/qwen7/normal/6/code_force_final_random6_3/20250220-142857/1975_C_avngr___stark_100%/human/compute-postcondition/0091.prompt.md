Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. The states of the other variables are not affected.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(min(a))
        continue
    max = 0
    for i in range(n - 2):
        temp = a[i:i + 3]
        temp.sort()
        if temp[1] > max:
            max = temp[1]
    print(max)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `max` will hold the maximum value among the second smallest elements (temp[1]) of every possible consecutive triplet in the list `a`. The variable `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is still 2, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 2, `t` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is the maximum value of the second largest element in any consecutive subarray of length 3 within `a`, and `i` is `n-1`; `temp` is a sorted sublist of `a` starting from index `n-4` and ending at index `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `-1`, `temp` is an empty list, and `max` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
