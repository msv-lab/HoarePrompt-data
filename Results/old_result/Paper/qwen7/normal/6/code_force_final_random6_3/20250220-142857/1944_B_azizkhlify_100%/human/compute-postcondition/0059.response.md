Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
- The element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` is equal to 1.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `i` is explicitly given as 0.
2. `a[i]` would then refer to `a[0]` because `i` is 0.
3. The element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` is given as 1. Since `a[i]` is `a[0]`, this means `a[0] - 1` should be the index in `l` where the value 1 is located.

Given that the element at index `a[0] - 1` in the list `l` is 1, it implies that `a[0] - 1` must be the index where the value 1 is found in `l`. Therefore, `a[0]` must be 2 (since `a[0] - 1 = 1`).

So, `a[0]` is 2, and the code snippet will print the value of `a[0]`.

Output: **2**
