Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `b` is a list with the last element being `lit[3]`, `a` is empty, `x` is infinity.**

Explanation: The code appends `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is 3, `b` now contains the element `lit[3]`. Since `a` was already empty, its state remains unchanged. The value of `x` is still infinity because the condition for updating `x` from the last element of `a` is not met (since `a` is still empty). The conditions for `n` and `i` remain the same as the initial state.
