Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the resulting list in `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
