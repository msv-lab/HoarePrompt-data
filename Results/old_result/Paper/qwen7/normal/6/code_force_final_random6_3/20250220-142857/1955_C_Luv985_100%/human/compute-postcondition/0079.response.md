Postcondition: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element may have been decremented multiple times, `l` is equal to `r`, indicating that the left pointer has caught up to the right pointer, `r` is equal to `l`, indicating that the right pointer has caught up to the left pointer, and `ans` is 0 since `k` is 0.**
