Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Let's break down why it is incorrect and provide a more accurate approach.

#### Issues with the Provided Solution:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs:**
   - The solution attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs using a loop that increments `count` from 2 to `m`. However, this approach does not correctly account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The logic inside the loop is flawed and does not accurately reflect the necessary conditions.

2. **Incorrect Use of GCD:**
   - The use of `g = n / count` and subsequent operations do not correctly compute the number of valid pairs based on the given conditions.

3. **Inefficient and Incorrect Loop Logic:**
   - The loop logic does not properly iterate through all possible values of `a` and `b` to check the condition for each pair.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Iterate Over All Possible Values of \(b\):**
   - For each value of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\), we need to find the corresponding values of \(a\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Check the Condition for Each Pair:**
   - For each \(b\), iterate over possible values of \(a\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This solution iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition directly, ensuring correctness.
