Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\).
   - `i` is now 0.
   - `n` is an input integer (its value does not change within the loop).
   - `k` is an input integer (its value does not change within the loop).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 1.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to 1.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`t` must be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\), `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**
