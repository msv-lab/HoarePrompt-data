Output State: **`a` is equal to `l[x]`, `b` is infinity, `c` is 0, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, and `x` is `n-1` where `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `l[x]` to `a`. Since `l[x]` is greater than `a` (which was initially infinity), `a` now holds the value of `l[x]`. The values of `b`, `c`, `l`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
