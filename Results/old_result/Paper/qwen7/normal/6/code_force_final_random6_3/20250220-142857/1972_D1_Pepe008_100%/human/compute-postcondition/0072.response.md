Output State: **`t` is `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is an integer value from `info[0]`, `b` is an integer value from `info[1]`**.

This means that the variable `t` retains its original value `T`, and the `info` list remains unchanged. The first element of the `info` list (converted to an integer) is assigned to `a`, and the second element (also converted to an integer) is assigned to `b`.
