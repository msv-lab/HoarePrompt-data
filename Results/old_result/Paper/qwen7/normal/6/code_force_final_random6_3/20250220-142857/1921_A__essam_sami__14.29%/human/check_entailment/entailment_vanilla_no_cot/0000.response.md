Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly identify the corners of the square. It assumes that any combination of points it calculates will form the sides of the square, which is not always true. The program needs to check all possible pairs of points to determine which pairs are opposite corners of the square.

To fix this, you need to calculate the distances between all pairs of points and identify the maximum distance, which should be the diagonal of the square. Since the square's sides are parallel to the axes, the diagonal will be the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by the side lengths of the square. Therefore, the side length can be derived from the diagonal using the Pythagorean theorem.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Calculate all pairwise distances
        distances = []
        for i in range(4):
            for j in range(i+1, 4):
                dist = math.sqrt((points[i][0] - points[j][0])**2 + (points[i][1] - points[j][1])**2)
                distances.append(dist)
        
        # Find the maximum distance (diagonal of the square)
        max_distance = max(distances)
        
        # Calculate the side length of the square
        side_length = math.sqrt(max_distance / math.sqrt(2))
        
        # Calculate the area of the square
        area = side_length ** 2
        
        print(int(area))

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the correct corners of the square are identified and calculates the area accurately.
