Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i + 1`: This means that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `k` is the third element of list `b` minus `dic[l[i-1]]` minus `dic[l[i]]`: Here, `k` is calculated using the third element of list `b`, the value of `dic` at the index given by the element at `l[i-1]`, and the value of `dic` at the index given by the element at `l[i]`.
- `dic` remains unchanged: The dictionary `dic` does not change.
- `len(l)` remains unchanged: The length of the list `l` does not change.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
