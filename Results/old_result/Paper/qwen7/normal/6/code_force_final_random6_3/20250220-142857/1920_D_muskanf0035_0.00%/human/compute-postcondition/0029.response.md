Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. `n` is an integer, `operations` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (op_type, value), and `queries` is a list of integers k_i. The function processes the operations and queries but does not add any elements to the array, returning an empty list 'result'.**
