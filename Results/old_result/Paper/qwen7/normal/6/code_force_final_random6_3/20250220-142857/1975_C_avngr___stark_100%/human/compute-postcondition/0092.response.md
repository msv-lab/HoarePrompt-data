Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and an array a consisting of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function calculates and returns the sum of all elements in array a.**

Note: The actual calculation or processing logic is not described here; only the input and output behavior of the function is detailed.
