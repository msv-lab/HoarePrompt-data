Postcondition: **`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` (sum of values in `D`) is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `fnd` remains the same. `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, otherwise it remains unchanged. `D[out_aa]` remains unchanged. `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `D[out_aa] > 0`, otherwise it is decreased by 2. `C[in_aa]` is incremented by 1 if `C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]`, otherwise `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1. If `C[in_aa] > 0`, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**
