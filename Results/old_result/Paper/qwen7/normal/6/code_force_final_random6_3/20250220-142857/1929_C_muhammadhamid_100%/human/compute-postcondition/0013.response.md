Output State: **`i` is `x`, `s` is \(2^x - 1\), `x` is `x + 1`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers from input**.

Explanation: The code reads three integers from input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. The initial values of `i` and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is updated to `x + 1` due to the initial state, but since the new value of `x` is assigned from the input, the updated value of `x` is now the input value plus one. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `k`, `x`, and `a` from the input, while `i` and `s` retain their initial values.
