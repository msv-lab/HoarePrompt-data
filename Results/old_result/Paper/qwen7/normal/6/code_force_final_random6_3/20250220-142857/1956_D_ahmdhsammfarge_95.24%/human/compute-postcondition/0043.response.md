Output State: **i is 1, j is len(lst), r is 1, l is 3, over_sum is lst[0] + lst[2] + 9.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` remains 1, `j` is set to the length of the list `lst` (since the loop iterates through `j` until it reaches the last index), `r` is 1, `l` is 3, and `over_sum` is the maximum sum calculated, which is `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9`.
