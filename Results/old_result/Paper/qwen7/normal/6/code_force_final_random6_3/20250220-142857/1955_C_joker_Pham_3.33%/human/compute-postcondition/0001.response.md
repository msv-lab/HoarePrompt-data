Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `sunks` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
