Output State: **`stack` is now ['(v, True)'], `v` is the first element of the last tuple in the original `stack`, and `postorder` is the second element of the last tuple in the original `stack`.**

Explanation: The code `stack.append((v, True))` appends a new tuple `(v, True)` to the `stack`. Since `stack` was initially an empty list, after appending, `stack` becomes `['(v, True)']`. The values of `v` and `postorder` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
