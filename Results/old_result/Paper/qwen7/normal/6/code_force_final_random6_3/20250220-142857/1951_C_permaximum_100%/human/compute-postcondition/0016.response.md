Output State: **`total_cost` is increased by `price * tickets_to_buy`, `pq` is a heap with one less element, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, `tickets_bought` is updated to `tickets_bought + tickets_to_buy`, `price_increase` is `price_increase + tickets_to_buy`, `price` is the price popped from the heap, `day` is the day popped from the heap, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, `price` is `price + price_increase`**

Explanation:
- The line `total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy` updates the `total_cost` by adding the product of `price` and `tickets_to_buy` to it. This means `total_cost` is now `total_cost + (price * tickets_to_buy)`.
- All other variables (`pq`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `tickets_bought`, `price_increase`, `price`, `day`, and `tickets_to_buy`) remain unchanged in terms of their definitions and relationships, but their actual values might have been updated elsewhere in the code. The specific values of these variables are not altered by this line of code.
