### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to minimize the cost of purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days, where the price per ticket on day `i` is `a_i`. There are constraints on the number of tickets that can be purchased per day (`m`) and how the price changes after purchasing tickets.

2. **Key Points in the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads the list of ticket prices `M` for each of the `n` days.
   - The program sorts the list of prices `M` to facilitate the calculation of the minimum cost.
   - It calculates the number of batches `q` of tickets that need to be purchased, where each batch size is `m`.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If `n * m == k`, it means we can purchase all tickets in full batches without any remainder.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost for the last batch of tickets which might not be a full batch.
   - The cost is calculated using the formula:
     - `cost = mu * w` for the last batch.
     - `cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` for the full batches.
     - `cost += n * m * mu` for the additional cost due to the increase in price.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the number of tickets to be purchased in a batch exceeds the available tickets for that day.
   - The sorting of prices ensures that the most expensive tickets are considered last, which helps in minimizing the overall cost.

5. **Verification**:
   - The logic seems to correctly handle the constraints and calculate the minimum cost based on the given rules.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the code and understanding its logic, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
