Output State: **`i` is `current_i + 1`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `ul` is `current_ul + 6`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Since no variables are reassigned or their values altered within the given code snippet, the preconditions remain valid and unchanged.
