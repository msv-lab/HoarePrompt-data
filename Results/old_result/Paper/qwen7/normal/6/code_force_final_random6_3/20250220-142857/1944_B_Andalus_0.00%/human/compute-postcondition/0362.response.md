Output State: **`ldb` is a non-empty list, the size of `ldb` (sz) is now sz + 2, and `k - sz` is at least 0.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 2. Since `sz` was originally less than `k` and `k - sz` was at least 2, after adding 2 to `sz`, the new value of `sz` is `sz + 2`. This means that `k - sz` is now at least 0. The list `ldb` and the variable `k` remain unchanged.
