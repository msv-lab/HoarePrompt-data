Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `t` in the range `range(T)`. This means the variable `t` is the only one that needs to be adjusted.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is within the range `range(T)`. This means `t` must be less than `T`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: The problem states that the loop has executed all iterations with `i` ranging from 1 to `b` (inclusive). This information is not directly relevant to adjusting the state for the `t` loop, but it helps us understand the context.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop is controlled by `t` and it must be less than `T` to continue executing, if the loop has just completed its last iteration, then `t` must have reached `T-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be set to `T`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is `T`**
