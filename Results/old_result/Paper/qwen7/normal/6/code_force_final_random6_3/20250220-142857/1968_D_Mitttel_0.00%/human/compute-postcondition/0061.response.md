Output State: **`remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `cycle_pos`, `cycle_score`, `score`, `current_pos`, `steps`, and the `visited` dictionary remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `k - steps` to the variable `remaining_steps`. This calculation updates the value of `remaining_steps` based on the current values of `k` and `steps`. However, the values of `cycle_pos`, `cycle_score`, `score`, `current_pos`, `steps`, and the `visited` dictionary remain unchanged from their initial states.
