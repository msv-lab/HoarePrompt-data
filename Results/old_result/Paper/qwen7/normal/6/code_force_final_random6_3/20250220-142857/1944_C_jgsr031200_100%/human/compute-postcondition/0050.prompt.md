You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\) and the length of the list is \(n\), with \(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\).
def func_1(arr):
    freq = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The `freq` list will contain the count of how many times each index from 0 to n (where n is the length of the `arr` list) appears in the `arr` list.
    #
    #In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the `freq` list will reflect the frequency of each integer in the `arr` list. Specifically, if the integer `j` appears `k` times in the `arr` list, then `freq[j]` will be equal to `k`. All other elements in the `freq` list (those indices that do not appear in `arr`) will remain as 0.
    cou = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if freq[i] >= 2:
            continue
        
        if freq[i] == 1:
            cou += 1
        
        if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
            print(i)
            break
        
    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and the final value of `i` is `n`. The variable `cou` remains 0 throughout the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\) and the length of the list is \(n\), with \(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
