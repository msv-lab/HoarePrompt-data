Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is greater than 5, `r` is 4, `l` is 2, `over_sum` is `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:2]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm`. Initially, `sm` was defined as `sum(lst[:2]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`. Now, it is updated to `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. Given that `i` is 2, the first part of the sum remains `sum(lst[:2])`. Since `j` is greater than 5, the second part of the sum is `sum(lst[j + 1:])`. The third part is `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, which is `(j - 2 + 1) ** 2 = (j - 1) ** 2`. Therefore, the new value of `sm` is `sum(lst[:2]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - 1) ** 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
