Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in sng`. The variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `sng` has at least one element.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `sz` is `sz` + 1 (this indicates that `sz` has been incremented).
   - `sng` must have at least one element.
   - We continue the most internal loop or if statement because the condition `sz` >= `k` is not met.

4. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `sng` must still have at least one element.
   - Since the loop is iterating over `sng`, `elem` will be set to the first element of `sng` in the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `sz` is already updated to `sz` + 1.
   - `sng` must still have at least one element.
   - `elem` will be set to the first element of `sng` in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`sz` is `sz` + 1, `sng` must have at least one element, `elem` is the first element of `sng`**.
