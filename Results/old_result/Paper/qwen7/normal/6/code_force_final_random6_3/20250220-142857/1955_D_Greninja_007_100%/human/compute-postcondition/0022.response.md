Postcondition: `ca[a[r - m]]` is decremented by 1, `sm` is either decremented by 1 or incremented by 1 depending on the condition `ca[a[r - m]]` <= `cb[a[r - m]]`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `ans` is 2 if `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `sm` is less than `k`, the values remain as they were before the if-else block executed.
