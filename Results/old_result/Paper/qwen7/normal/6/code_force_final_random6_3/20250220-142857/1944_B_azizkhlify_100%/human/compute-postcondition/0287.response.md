Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`; `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` by 1. However, the initial values of `r` and `a` are not provided, so we only know that `i` is `n + 1`. The exact value of `r[a[i] - 1]` cannot be determined without knowing the values of `r` and `a`. Therefore, we state that `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.
