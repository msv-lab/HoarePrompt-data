Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer is an input integer from the user, `values` is a list of length max(`numbers`) + 1 filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length max(`numbers`) + 1 filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The line `total = 0` initializes the variable `total` to 0. No other changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, the initial conditions for `t`, `numbers`, `values`, and `sum_values` remain unchanged.
