Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer, `nums` is an empty deque, `ans` is the total number of times `b` was not greater than 0 during the loop's execution.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, since `len(nums)` eventually becomes less than 2, the loop terminates. At this point, `nums` will be an empty deque because it loses at least one element in each iteration as long as `k` is greater than 0 and `nums` has at least two elements. The value of `ans` will be the total count of times `b` was not greater than 0 (i.e., `b` was 0 or negative) throughout the loop's execution, as each such occurrence increments `ans` by 1.
