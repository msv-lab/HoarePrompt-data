Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `n`, `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2`, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2)`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if hd > 0:
        hd -= 1
        continue
    if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - 1`, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `i` is less than `n`. If `hd` is currently greater than 0 and the current character in `s1` at index `i` is '1' while the current character in `s2` at index `i` is '0', then `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1` and `res` is incremented by 1. If the condition is not met, the values remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - 2`, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`, `i` is less than `n` and becomes `i + 1`. If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', then `hd` is decremented by 1 to become `a1 - a2 - 3` and `res` is incremented by 1 to become `abs(a1 - a2) + 2`. If `s1[i]` is not '1' or `s2[i]` is not '0', the values of `hd` and `res` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - 4` or `a1 - a2 - 3`, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + 2` or `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `s1[i]` equals '1' and `s2[i]` equals '0', then `hd` becomes `a1 - a2 - 4` or `a1 - a2 - 3`, and `res` becomes `abs(a1 - a2) + 3` or `abs(a1 - a2) + 2`. If `s1[i]` does not equal '1' or `s2[i]` does not equal '0', the conditions for `hd` and `res` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
