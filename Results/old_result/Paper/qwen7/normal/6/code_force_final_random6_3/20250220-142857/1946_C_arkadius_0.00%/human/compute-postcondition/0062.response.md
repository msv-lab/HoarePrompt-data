Output State: **`stack` contains tuples of all the vertices in the subtree rooted at `v`, with their second element set to `False`, `(postorder)` is true, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated by adding 1 to its current value, and the state of `tree.vertices[u]` for each `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children` remains unchanged.**

This means that the `good_components` attribute of the vertex `v` in the `tree` object has been incremented by 1, while all other conditions and states remain the same as the initial state.
