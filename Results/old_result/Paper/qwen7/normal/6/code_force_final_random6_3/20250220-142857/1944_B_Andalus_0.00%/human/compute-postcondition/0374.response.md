Output State: **`ldb` is a non-empty list with the same size as it was at the end of the previous iteration and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify the value of `ldb`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no other operations are performed on `ldb`, its state remains unchanged from the initial state.
