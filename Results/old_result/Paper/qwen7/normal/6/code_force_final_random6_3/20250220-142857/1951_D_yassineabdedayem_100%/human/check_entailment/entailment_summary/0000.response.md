Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if Bob can set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.
2. The provided solution attempts to handle two specific conditions:
   - When \( n = k \), it prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin.
   - When \( n + 2 > k \times 2 \), it prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with prices \( n - k + 1 \) and 1 coin respectively.
3. However, the solution fails to cover all possible scenarios:
   - It does not handle the general case where \( n \neq k \) and \( n + 2 \leq k \times 2 \).
   - It does not ensure that the number of stalls is at most 60.
   - It does not provide a way to distribute the prices across more than 2 stalls when necessary.
4. The solution also does not correctly implement the logic to ensure Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels in all cases.

Given these issues, the provided solution is incomplete and incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
