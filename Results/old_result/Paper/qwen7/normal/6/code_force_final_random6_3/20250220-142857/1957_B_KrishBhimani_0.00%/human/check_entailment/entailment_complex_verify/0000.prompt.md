You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

            if c == n - 1:
                ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all iterations will be a list `ans` of length `n`. The list `arr` will contain indices where `k` had its least significant bit set to 1 during the loop. The variable `c` will be equal to `n` plus the number of bits set in `k`. The list `ans` will start with values derived from powers of 2 based on the indices in `arr`, and will be extended by zeros to match the length of `n`. Specifically, `ans` will contain values calculated as follows:
    #
    #- For each index `i` in `arr`, `ans` will include `1 << i`.
    #- If `c` equals `n - 1`, the remaining elements of `ans` will be filled with the value `k0 - sum(ans)`, followed by zeros to reach the length `n`.
    #
    #Given the example provided, if the loop runs multiple times and the final state of `arr` contains the indices where `k` had its bits set, and if `c` is calculated correctly, the final `ans` will be constructed according to the described rules. Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, and `t` are not specified, the final `ans` will depend on these inputs, but it will follow the pattern described above.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it constructs a list `ans` of length \( n \) based on the binary representation of \( k \). Specifically, it identifies the positions of the least significant bits set to 1 in \( k \), and populates `ans` with powers of 2 corresponding to these positions. If the count of such positions plus one equals \( n \), it fills the remaining elements of `ans` with a specific value derived from `k` and zeros. The function outputs the constructed list `ans` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence \(a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n\).

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `2 5`
- Expected Output: A sequence like `[5, 0]` or `[3, 2]` because both sequences sum to 5 and their bitwise OR results in `(101)_2`, which has three 1s in its binary representation.

However, the program generates a sequence based on the binary representation of `k` itself. For `k = 5`, the binary representation is `(101)_2`. The program will generate the sequence `[0, 1, 2]` because it appends powers of 2 corresponding to the 1s in the binary representation of `k`. This results in a sequence that sums to 3, not 5.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized. One way to do this is to set most elements of the sequence to 0 and the last element to `k` minus the sum of the other elements, ensuring the bitwise OR is maximized. The provided solution does not account for this and thus fails to meet the requirements in some cases.
