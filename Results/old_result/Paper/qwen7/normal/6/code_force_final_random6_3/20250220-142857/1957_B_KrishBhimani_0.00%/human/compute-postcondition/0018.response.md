Output State: **`k` is `k` right-shifted by 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `l1` is converted to an integer `n`, `arr` is a list containing the integers `0` and `1`, `i` is 2.**

In this code snippet, `k` is right-shifted by 1 bit. This means that each bit in the binary representation of `k` is shifted one position to the right, and the least significant bit is discarded. The value of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
