Output State: **`ans` is 1, `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` was 0, so after executing this line, `ans` becomes 1. The other variables (`sm`, `cb`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `ca`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
