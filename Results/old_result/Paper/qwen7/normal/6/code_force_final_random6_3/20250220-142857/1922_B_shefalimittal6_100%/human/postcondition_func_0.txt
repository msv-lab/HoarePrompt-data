The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) (number of test cases), a positive integer \( n \) (size of the list), and a list of non-negative integers \( a \). For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on the frequency of each integer in the list \( a \). This value is derived from combinations of counts of integers appearing at least twice or three times. The function then stores these calculated values as strings in a list and prints them, one per line.
