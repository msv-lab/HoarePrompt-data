Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - If `n` is odd, the condition remains unchanged.
   - If `n` is even, `s` is set to 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, and the condition remains unchanged as long as the length of `s` is less than 200 or exactly 200.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `_` (which is typically used when the loop variable is not needed) does not affect the state.
   - The loop itself depends on `t`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop depends on `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration.
   - `n` and `s` are not directly affected by the loop itself but by the conditions within the loop body, which are not provided here. However, since the loop body is omitted, we assume no changes are made to `n` and `s` other than the initial conditions.

5. **New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `t` must be decremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume `n` remains the same.
   - `s` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume `s` remains the same.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 49, `n` is an integer, `s` is either unchanged or set according to the initial conditions if `n` was even.**
