Output State: **`cb` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in the sorted list `b`; `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values; `a` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `cb = Counter(sorted(b))` creates a `Counter` object named `cb` that contains the counts of each element in the list `b` after sorting it. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The list `a` also remains unchanged since it is not involved in the operation.
