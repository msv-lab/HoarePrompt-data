Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input, where `a` is the first integer, `b` is the second integer, and `c` is the third integer. Regardless of whether the condition `a < b < c` holds or not, the values of `t`, `q`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.**
