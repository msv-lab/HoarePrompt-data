Output State: **`flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the minimum value between its current value (which is undefined in the initial state) and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `cnt` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
