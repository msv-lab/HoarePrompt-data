Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is greater than 3, `r` is 1, `l` is 3, `over_sum` is `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:2]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2**.

Explanation: The variable `sm` is assigned the value of the sum of elements from the start of the list up to index `i-1` (which is `lst[:2]`), plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of the list, plus the square of the difference between `j` and `i` plus one. Since `i` is 2 and `j` is greater than 3, `j - i + 1` will be a positive integer, and its square will be added to the sums of the list segments. The exact value of `sm` depends on the values in the list `lst`, but the structure of the calculation is as described.
