Output State: `i` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to the length of `lst`, `r` is 2, `l` is 5, `over_sum` is `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` remains 2 because the loop only increments `j` and does not change `i`. The value of `j` becomes greater than or equal to the length of `lst` since the loop continues as long as `j` is less than the length of `lst`. The variable `r` is set to 2 based on the first iteration's condition, and it remains unchanged as no subsequent `j` value makes `sm` greater than `over_sum`. The variable `l` is set to 5 during one of the iterations and remains unchanged. The `over_sum` remains `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9` as no new value surpasses this sum during the loop iterations.
