Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`numCasos`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: The variables `pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m` are correctly initialized and assigned values from the input.
3. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with the appropriate parameters, which is correct.
4. **Function Logic**:
   - The function iterates backward through the list `a` from `n-1` to `0`.
   - For each position `i`, it checks if `i < m`. If true, it updates `pergunta` to be the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]`.
   - It then adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`.
   - This logic ensures that `pergunta` holds the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions, considering the costs `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

Given the provided code and the logical flow, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be within the first `m` positions in the queue.

Correctness: **True**
