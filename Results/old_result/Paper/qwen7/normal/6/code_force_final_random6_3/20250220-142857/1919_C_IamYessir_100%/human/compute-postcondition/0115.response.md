Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `y` is the last element of list `b`, if the list `a` is empty, `x` is infinity, otherwise `x` is the last element of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `y = b[-1]` assigns the last element of list `b` to variable `y`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or `x`. The conditions for `n` and the value of `x` remain unchanged as per the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `y` and retains the original conditions for `i`, `n`, and `x`.
