Postcondition: `v` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, we continue the loop or iteration. If `v` is not 0 and it is not in `remaining_vertices`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we do not change the state of `v` and `u`.
