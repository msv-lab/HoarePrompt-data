Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, and `t` is now the integer input value.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676 remains valid, and after executing the code, `t` is updated to the integer value entered by the user.
