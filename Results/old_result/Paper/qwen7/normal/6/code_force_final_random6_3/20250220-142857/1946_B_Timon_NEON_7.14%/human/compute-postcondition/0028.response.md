Output State: **`max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list where the first element is increased by `arr[2]`, `max_segment` is either [0, 0] or [1, 0] or [arr[1], 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing `[0, 0, 2]` or `[new_segment + [2]]` or `[max_segment + [2]]`, `i` is 4, `arr` is a non-empty list.**

Explanation: The code appends the list `max_segment + [i - 1]` to `segments_variants`. Given that `i` was initially 3, after the operation `i - 1` equals 2. Therefore, `segments_variants` now includes the updated list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
