Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, and either `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[0]` (in which case `rdb` is a list containing the value of `rgt[0]` appended with `rgt[3]`), or `rgt[2]` is not equal to `rgt[0]` (in which case `rdb` is a list containing the value of `rgt[0]` appended with `rgt[3]`).**

Explanation: The code appends `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Initially, `i` is 2. After executing `rdb.append(rgt[i])`, `i` becomes 3 because the index is incremented implicitly when accessing `rgt[i]` with `i` being 2. The conditions for `rdb` remain the same, whether `rgt[2]` equals `rgt[0]` or not, `rdb` will contain the value of `rgt[0]` followed by the value of `rgt[3]`.
