Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- The loop condition is: `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
  - `i` is `d-2`
  - `d` must be greater than 1
  - `len(row)` must be greater than `d-1`
  - `min_heap` must contain a tuple where the first element is `row[d-4]` and the second element is less than or equal to `-4`

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop pops an element from `min_heap` and checks if the second element of the tuple (`e[1]`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.
   - For the loop to continue, `e[1]` must be greater than `i - (d + 2)`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `i` is `d-2`
   - `d` is greater than 1
   - `len(row)` is greater than `d-1`
   - `min_heap` contains a tuple where the first element is `row[d-4]` and the second element is less than or equal to `-4`.

3. **Next Iteration Requirement:**
   - To ensure the loop continues, the popped element `e[1]` must be greater than `i - (d + 2)`.
   - Substituting the current values: `i - (d + 2) = (d-2) - (d + 2) = d - 2 - d - 2 = -4`.
   - Therefore, `e[1]` must be greater than `-4`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - The only state that can be adjusted is `min_heap` because it is the only object involved in the loop condition.
   - We need to ensure that `min_heap` contains a tuple where the first element is `row[d-4]` and the second element is greater than `-4`.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is `d-2`, `d` must be greater than 1, `len(row)` must be greater than `d-1`, `min_heap` must contain a tuple where the first element is `row[d-4]` and the second element is greater than `-4`**
