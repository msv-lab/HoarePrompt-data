Output State: **The program returns a list named `results` which contains the sum of `count` for each iteration.**

This means that after processing all tuples in `test_cases`, the variable `results` holds a list where each element represents the cumulative sum of `count` for each iteration of the loop. The loop likely iterates over each tuple in `test_cases`, updating `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` with counts of unique remainders from modulo operations, and `count` keeps track of occurrences where previously seen keys match the current ones in these maps. The final `results` list captures these cumulative sums for analysis or further processing.
