Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in arr:`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be an element of the list `arr`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `c` is 9 (not involved in the loop head)
   - `arr` is a list containing [1, 4, 8] (the list itself does not change within the loop)
   - `i` is 4 (the current value of `i`)
   - `ans` is a list containing [-11, 16] (not involved in the loop head)

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 4, the next value of `i` should be the next element in the list `arr`.
   - The list `arr` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The variable `c` and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Determine the next value of `i`**: The next value of `i` should be the next element in the list `arr` after 4. Since `arr` contains [1, 4, 8], the next value of `i` would be 8.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`c` is 9, `arr` is a list containing [1, 4, 8], `i` is 8, `ans` is a list containing [-11, 16]**
