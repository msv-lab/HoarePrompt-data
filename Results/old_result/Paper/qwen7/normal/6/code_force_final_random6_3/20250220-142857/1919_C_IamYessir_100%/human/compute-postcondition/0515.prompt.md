Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a, b = [], []
    cp = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        if len(a) == 0:
            x = float('inf')
        else:
            x = a[-1]
        if len(b) == 0:
            y = float('inf')
        else:
            y = b[-1]
        if x > y:
            if y >= lit[i]:
                b.append(lit[i])
            elif lit[i] > x:
                b.append(lit[i])
            elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
                a.append(lit[i])
        elif x == y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif x < y:
            if x >= lit[i]:
                a.append(lit[i])
            elif lit[i] > y:
                a.append(lit[i])
            elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
                b.append(lit[i])
    s = 0
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
            s += 1
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
            s += 1
    print(s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: i is equal to the length of list b minus 1, and s is the count of consecutive elements in list b where each element is greater than the previous one.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of `b`, `s` will be the count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than its predecessor, `n` will be the total number of iterations executed (which is `len(b) - 1`), `x` will be reassigned to the last element of list `b`, `y` will still be `float('inf')`, and lists `a` and `b` will contain elements based on the conditions involving `x` and `lit[i]` for list `a`, and `y` and `lit[i]` for list `b`. The list `lit` will remain unchanged.

This means that after the loop completes, `i` will be equal to the length of `b`, indicating that the loop has iterated through all elements of `b`. The variable `s` will hold the count of how many times an element in `b` was found to be greater than the previous element. The variable `n` will be `len(b) - 1` because the loop runs from `1` to `len(b) - 1`. `x` will be the last element of `b`, and `y` remains `float('inf')`. Lists `a` and `b` will be constructed based on the conditions specified but without further details provided, we cannot specify their exact contents.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(b) - 1`, `s` will be the count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than its predecessor. The list `b` will contain all elements from `lit` that satisfy the condition `a[i] > a[i - 1]` for some `i`. Variables `n`, `a`, `lit`, `cp`, `x`, and `y` will retain their final states based on the conditions specified within the loop. `x` will be equal to the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise it will be positive infinity. `y` will be positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise it will be the smallest element in `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
