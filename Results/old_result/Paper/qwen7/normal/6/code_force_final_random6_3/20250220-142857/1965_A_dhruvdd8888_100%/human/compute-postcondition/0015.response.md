Output State: `ls` is the sum of all elements in the list `nums`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, and `nums[i]` is not accessed since `i` is out of bounds.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ls` will hold the sum of all elements in the list `nums`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as does `N`, `n`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The list `nums` itself remains sorted, and the variable `i` will be equal to the length of `nums`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
