Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional statement we are currently inside. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 3 is still valid.
