Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It then iterates `t` times, reading `n` and `k` for each test case.
3. The logic for determining the result (`res`) based on the values of `n` and `k` is as follows:
   - If `k == n`, it sets `res` to a list of `n` ones.
   - If `k == 1`, it sets `res` to a range object from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Otherwise, it sets `res` to `[-1]`.

However, the implementation of the logic for `k == 1` and `k == n` needs to ensure that the resulting array meets the criteria of having exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.

- For `k == n`, the array `[1] * n` will always be sorted, so this condition is met.
- For `k == 1`, the array `range(n)` (which is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`) will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift when `n` is 1, but for `n > 1`, it will not meet the requirement because cyclic shifts like `[1, 2, ..., n-1, 0]` will not be sorted.

Therefore, the logic for `k == 1` is incorrect for `n > 1`.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly handles the case where `k == 1` and `n > 1`. For `n > 1`, the array `range(n)` will not have exactly one sorted cyclic shift, thus failing to meet the problem requirements.
