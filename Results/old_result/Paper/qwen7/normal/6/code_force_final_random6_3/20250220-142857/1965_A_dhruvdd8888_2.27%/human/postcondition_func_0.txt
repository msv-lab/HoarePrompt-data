The function processes a series of test cases. For each case, it reads a set of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, sorts them, and then determines whether to print 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on specific conditions. If the count of consecutive integers starting from the second element is odd, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. The function does not return any value but prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' for each test case.
