Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers; `D` is a dictionary with all elements set to zero; `C` is an empty list; `tot` is 0; `fnd` is the total number of times the loop executed if `sum(D.values())` was greater than or equal to `k` during any iteration, otherwise `fnd` is incremented by 1 for each iteration.**

This means that the input values for `n`, `m`, and `k` have been read and stored as integers. The dictionary `D` remains unchanged with all its values set to zero. The list `C` remains empty. The variable `tot` remains at 0. The variable `fnd` is initialized based on the condition involving `sum(D.values())` and `k`, but since no iterations have occurred yet, `fnd` is still set to the default value as described.
