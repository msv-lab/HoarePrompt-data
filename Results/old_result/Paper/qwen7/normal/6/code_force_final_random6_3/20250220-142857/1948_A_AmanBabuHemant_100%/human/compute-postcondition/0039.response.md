Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.**

Given the constraints and the lack of any input parameters in the function definition, the function does not take any arguments. The described output cases do not correspond to any input parameters but rather seem to imply internal logic or test cases that are not reflected in the function signature. Since there are no parameters provided, the function's role is undefined within the given context.
