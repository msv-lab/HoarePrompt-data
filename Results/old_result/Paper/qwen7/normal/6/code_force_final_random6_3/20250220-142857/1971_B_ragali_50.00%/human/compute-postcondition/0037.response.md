Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in s:`. This means the objects involved are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the initial state**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
   - `i` is the second-to-last character of the string `s.strip()`.
   - `s` is a non-empty string without leading or trailing spaces.
   - `a` is an empty set.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute, the variable `s` must be a non-empty string because the loop iterates over each character in `s`.
   - The variable `i` is already defined as the second-to-last character of `s.strip()`, but for the loop to start, `s` must contain at least two characters (so that there is a second-to-last character).

Given these points, the only variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `s` and `i`.

- `s` must be a non-empty string with at least two characters.
- `i` is already correctly defined as the second-to-last character of `s.strip()`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, `i` is the second-to-last character of `s.strip()`**.
