Output State: **`i` is added to the set `win`; `us` is a set of integers; `ans` is a list containing the element `i`; `ps` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `ps += 1` increments the value of `ps` by 1. Since `ps` was not initialized before, it is assumed to be 0 initially. After executing `ps += 1`, the value of `ps` becomes 1. The other variables (`win`, `us`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
