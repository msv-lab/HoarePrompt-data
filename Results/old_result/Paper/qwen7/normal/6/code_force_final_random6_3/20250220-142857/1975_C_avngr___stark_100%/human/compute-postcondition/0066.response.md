Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is the maximum value of the second largest element in any consecutive subarray of length 3 within `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `temp` is a sorted sublist of `a` starting from index `n-4` and ending at index `n-1`. Since the condition `n == 2` is not specified in the if part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
