Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `n` is greater than 1, and `ldb` contains the value of `lft[i]` if `i` is 1 and `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `sng` contains the element `lft[i]` if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. If neither condition is met, no changes occur to `ldb` and `sng`.
