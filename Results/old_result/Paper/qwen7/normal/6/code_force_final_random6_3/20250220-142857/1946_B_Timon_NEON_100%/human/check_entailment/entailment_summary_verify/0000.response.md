### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description and the function summaries.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It is not used in the context of solving the problem and does not contribute to the solution.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to find the maximum sum subarray.
   - However, it does not account for the possibility of inserting the sum of any contiguous subarray into the array multiple times.
   - The logic inside the function is flawed and does not handle the insertion of sums into the array as required.
   - For example, it only considers subarrays with non-negative sums and does not explore all possible subarrays.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is incomplete and does not contain any logic to solve the problem.
   - It initializes `answer` to 0 but does not perform any operations to maximize the array sum through the specified operations.

Given the problem description, the correct approach would involve:
- Iteratively selecting and inserting the sum of any subarray into the array.
- Keeping track of the current maximum sum achievable after each operation.
- Ensuring the final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The provided code does not implement these steps. Instead, it focuses on finding the maximum sum subarray, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as described. The logic in `func_2` and `func_3` is insufficient and does not address the core requirement of inserting the sum of any subarray multiple times.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not properly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
