Output State: **`index` is 13 + 2 * n, `PB` is an integer from `data[6]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `k` is `int(data[4])`, `PS` is an integer from `data[9]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, data[index:index + n])`, `n` is `int(data[index])`**.

This means that the value of `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`. All other variables retain their previous values as per the initial state.
