Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i` which iterates over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `s`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ac` is either 1 or 2.
   - `q` is 2.
   - `bc` is either 0 or 1.
   - `s` is an input string that must have at least one character.

4. **Analyze the loop body**: The loop body processes each character `i` in the string `s`. Based on the given postconditions:
   - If the next character `next_char` is 'A', then `ac` becomes 2 and `bc` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `ac` remains the same and `bc` is either 0 or 1.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `s`, the string `s` must have at least one character remaining.
   - `q` remains 2.
   - `ac` remains either 1 or 2.
   - `bc` remains either 0 or 1.
   - The next character `next_char` is the first character of the remaining string `s`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the string `s` now has at least one character removed (since the loop processed one character), but still has at least one character remaining.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ac` is either 1 or 2, `q` is 2, `bc` is either 0 or 1, `s` is an input string that must have at least one character remaining**.
