Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `N` is the same, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of the value `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt`. Since `i` is initially `i + 1`, `i` remains `i + 1`. The value of `N` is unchanged. The value of `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.
