Postcondition: `first` remains False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and if the current value of `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, no changes are made to `i` and `first` remains as is. If `mpp[i]` is equal to 1 and `first` is True, no changes are made to `i` and `first` remains as is. Additionally, if `mpp[i]` is equal to 1 and `first` is False, `i` is set to 0 and `first` is set to True.
