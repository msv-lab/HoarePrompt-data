Output State: **`T` is now `T - 1`, `n` is the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element has been converted to an integer using `map(lambda x: int(x), a)`, `l` is equal to `r`, indicating that the left pointer has caught up to the right pointer, `r` is equal to `l`, indicating that the right pointer has caught up to the left pointer, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))` converts each element in the list `a` to an integer. The other variables (`T`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `r`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
