Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, `r` is `r + 1`, `l` is `l + 1`, and `n` is `l - r + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `n = l - r + 1` calculates the length of the list `lst` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of `lst`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `n` based on the updated values of `l` and `r`.
