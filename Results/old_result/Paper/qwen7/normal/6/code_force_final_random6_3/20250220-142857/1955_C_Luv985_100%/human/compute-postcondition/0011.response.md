Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` using `map` and `lambda`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `ans` is set to 0.
