#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and x are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n. The list of moves consists of m tuples, each containing an integer r_i (1 ≤ r_i ≤ n - 1) and a character c_i ('0', '1', or '?'), where '0' indicates a clockwise throw, '1' indicates a counterclockwise throw, and '?' indicates an unknown direction.
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program reads a line from standard input, strips any trailing whitespace, and returns it as a string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing whitespace, and returns it as a string. This operation is performed without requiring any input parameters.

For each of the m lines, r_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ r_i ≤ n - 1, and c_i is a character that can be '0', '1', or '?'.
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns an integer value obtained from the function `func_1()` for the given test case parameters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any direct parameters. Instead, it relies on the test case parameters t, n, m, x, r_i, and c_i which are presumably provided externally. It calls another function `func_1()` for each test case and returns an integer value obtained from `func_1()`.

For each test case, n, m, and x are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n.

def func_3():

    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting a string returned by func_1() and converting each element to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers. This list is derived by first obtaining a string from `func_1()`, then splitting this string into individual elements, and finally converting each element to an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players (2 <= n <= 1000), m is an integer representing the number of throws (1 <= m <= 1000), x is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 <= x <= n), and ans is a set initialized with the player x. The function func_1() returns a string containing the distance r and direction c for each throw, and func_3() returns a tuple (n, m, x).

    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `n` is an integer representing the number of players, `m` is an integer representing the number of throws which must be exactly equal to the number of iterations the loop executed, `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball, `ans` is a set containing all possible positions the ball can be in after `m` throws, `r` is an integer obtained from converting the first split element of the result of `func_1()` to an integer, `c` is a string obtained from the second split element of the result of `func_1()`, and `c` could be any character ('0', '1', or '?').

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes the number of players, number of throws, and the initial player position to determine all possible positions the ball can be in after all throws. It then prints the count of these positions and lists them in sorted order.
