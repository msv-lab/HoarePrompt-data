Output State: **`d` is `d - 2`, `v` is the return value of `func_1(d - 1)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d - 1)`, `path` contains the value of `v` if `v` does not equal 0, `remaining_vertices` has removed the vertex `v` from its list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This output state indicates that the variables `d`, `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` retain their values as they were before the `break` statement was executed. Additionally, it mentions that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
