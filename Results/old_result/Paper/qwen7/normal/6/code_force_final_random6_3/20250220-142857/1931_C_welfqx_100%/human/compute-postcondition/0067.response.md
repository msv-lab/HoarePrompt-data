Postcondition: **`ii` is 2, `n` is a value such that the loop runs `n - 1` times and `n > 3`, `cn` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, and `num` is a list. If `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, `ck` is increased by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
