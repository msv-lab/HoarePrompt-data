Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50
- The value of `v[v[1]]` is equal to 1

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(2)`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The value of `i` is explicitly given as 1.
2. The value of `n` is not directly relevant to the print statement since it is not used in the print statement itself.
3. The value of `v[v[1]]` is explicitly given as 1, but this does not affect the print statement either.

The print statement `print(2)` simply outputs the integer 2.

Output: **2**
