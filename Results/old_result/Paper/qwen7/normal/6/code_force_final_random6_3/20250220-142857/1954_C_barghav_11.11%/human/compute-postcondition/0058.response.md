Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether the strings x and y represent the same integer when their digits are reversed.**

This means the function checks if the strings `x` and `y` are reverses of each other and returns `True` if they are, otherwise it returns `False`. However, since the function signature does not include any parameters, the description focuses on the expected behavior given the constraints on `x` and `y`.
