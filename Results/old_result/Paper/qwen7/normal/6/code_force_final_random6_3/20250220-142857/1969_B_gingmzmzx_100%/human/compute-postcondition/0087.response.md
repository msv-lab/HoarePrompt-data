Based on the initial state described:

- `s` is a sequence of elements that have been processed.
- `cnt[0]` holds the count of 0s in `s`.
- `cnt[1]` holds the count of 1s in `s`.
- `ans` is the sum of the count of 1s in `s` plus the maximum difference between the number of zeroes and the count of 0s encountered so far for each element in `s` that is not 0.

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the calculation of `ans`:

1. **Count of 1s (`cnt[1]`)**: This is straightforward; it is the number of 1s in the sequence `s`.

2. **Maximum Difference Calculation**: For each element in `s` that is not 0, we need to keep track of the count of 0s encountered so far and find the maximum difference between this count and the count of 0s (`cnt[0]`). 

   - If the current element is 1, no change in the count of 0s is needed.
   - If the current element is 0, increment the count of 0s encountered so far.

Let's denote:
- `max_diff` as the maximum difference between the number of zeroes encountered so far and the count of 0s (`cnt[0]`).

Given the definition of `ans`, it is the sum of `cnt[1]` and `max_diff`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **cnt[1] + max_diff**
