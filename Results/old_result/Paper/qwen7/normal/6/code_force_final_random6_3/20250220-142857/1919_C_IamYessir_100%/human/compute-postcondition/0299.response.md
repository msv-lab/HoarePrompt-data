Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of list `b` + 1, `n` must be at least 1, `x` is either set to infinity (float('inf')) or reassigned to the last element of list `a`, `y` is either unchanged (float('inf')) or set to the last element of list `b`, and `b` and `lit` are unchanged. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `i` is incremented to the length of list `b` + 2, and the last element of list `b` is updated to `lit[i-1]`. Otherwise, the last element of list `a` is updated to `lit[i]` if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.
