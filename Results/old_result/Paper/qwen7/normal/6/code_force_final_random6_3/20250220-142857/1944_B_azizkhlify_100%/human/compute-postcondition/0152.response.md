Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is the original value of `k`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` by 1. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still `n + 1`, `n` is still the original value of `k`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.
