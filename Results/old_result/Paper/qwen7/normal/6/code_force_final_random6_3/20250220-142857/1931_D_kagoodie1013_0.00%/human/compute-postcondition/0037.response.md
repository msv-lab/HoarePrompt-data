Output State: **`mod_x` is `-num % x`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the modulus of `-num` divided by `x` and assigns the result to `mod_x`. Since the initial values of `num` and `x` are not specified, the expression `-num % x` remains as it is. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is that `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x`.
