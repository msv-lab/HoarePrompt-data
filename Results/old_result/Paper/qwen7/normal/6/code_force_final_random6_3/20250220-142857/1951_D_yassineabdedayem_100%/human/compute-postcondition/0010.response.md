Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an integer read from standard input.
- `k` is an integer read from standard input.
- The condition \(n + 2 > 2k\) holds true.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('YES')
```

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. Since no values of `n` and `k` are explicitly provided, the condition \(n + 2 > 2k\) is used to determine the context but does not affect the output of the `print` statement itself.

Output: **YES**
