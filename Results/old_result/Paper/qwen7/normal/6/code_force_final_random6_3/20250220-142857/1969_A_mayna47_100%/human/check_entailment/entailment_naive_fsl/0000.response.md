Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where no pair of friends are each other's best friends. In such cases, the program incorrectly prints `2` or `3` instead of the correct minimum number of invitations needed.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
1 2 3 4
```
Here, no friend is the best friend of another friend. Therefore, Monocarp needs to invite all four friends to ensure at least two friends come to the party. However, the program will incorrectly print `2` or `3` because it does not account for this scenario.

To fix this, the program should check if there exists any pair of friends who are each other's best friends and handle the general case where no such pairs exist separately.
