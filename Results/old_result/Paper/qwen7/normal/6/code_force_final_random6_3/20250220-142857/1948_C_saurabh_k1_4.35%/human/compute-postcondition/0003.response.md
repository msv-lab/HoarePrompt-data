Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(str, input()))` takes an input from the user, converts each character of the input into a string, and stores these strings in a list named `b`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `t` is still an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is still an input integer, and `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input.
