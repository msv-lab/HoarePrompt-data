Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r`. However, the initial values of `a` and `r` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `r[a[i] - 1]` after the increment. We only know that `r[a[i] - 1]` has been incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
