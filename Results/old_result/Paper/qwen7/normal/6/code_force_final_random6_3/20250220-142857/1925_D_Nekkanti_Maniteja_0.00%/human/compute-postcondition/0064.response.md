Output State: **`s` is 0, `i` is `k + m + 1`, `c` is `n * (n - 1) // 1`, `a` is `a + f`, `u` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input, `f` is the third integer from the input, the input is split into integers and assigned to `u`, `v`, and `f` respectively.**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The other variables (`s`, `i`, `c`, `a`) remain unchanged with their initial values. The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are now the integers from the input, and the rest of the variables retain their initial states.
