Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n` (inclusive). This means the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, after the first iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must remain greater than or equal to 2.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` changes from 1 to 2.
   - `n` must remain greater than or equal to 2.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
