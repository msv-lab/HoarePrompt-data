Postcondition: `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer from the first input split, and `b` is an integer from the second input split. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`, and `t` is adjusted based on whether `t2` is divisible by 15 or not. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15 + 1`. `t1` is less than `a`.
