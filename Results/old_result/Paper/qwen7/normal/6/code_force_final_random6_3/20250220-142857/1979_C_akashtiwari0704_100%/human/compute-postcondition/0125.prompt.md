Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):

    def lcm(l):
        g = 1
        for i in range(len(l)):
            g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
        return g
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = lcm(a)
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sumo` is the original value plus the sum of `int(a[i])` for all `i` in the range of `bets`, `bets` must be greater than or equal to 0, `T` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `g` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `bets`, and `prod` is the least common multiple of all integers in list `a` after the updates. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, then `T` is 0. Otherwise, the final value of `ans` will be the concatenation of all elements in the list `a` separated by spaces.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `bets` is at least the total number of iterations (N), `i` is equal to either N or 2 * N, `sumo` is the cumulative sum of `prod // a[i]` for each iteration, each element in the list `a` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for the corresponding index `i`, and either `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod` or `ans` is the concatenation of 'a[i] ' for all `i` from 0 to `N-1` and `bets` is greater than or equal to `N`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `bets` is a positive integer, `i` is the last index processed (i.e., `bets - 1`). If `sumo >= prod`, then `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, and each element `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` after being used in the calculation of `sumo`. Otherwise, `i` is equal to twice the final value of `bets` minus 2, `ans` is the concatenation of `'a[i] '` for all `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, and `bets` is the final value it was set to after all iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
