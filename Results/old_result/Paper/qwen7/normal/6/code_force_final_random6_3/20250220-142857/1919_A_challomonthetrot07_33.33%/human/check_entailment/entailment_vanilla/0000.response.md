### Reasoning:

1. **Test Cases Analysis**:
   - For each test case, the program takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - The program then checks various conditions to determine the winner based on the values of `a` and `b`.

2. **Conditions Checked**:
   - **Case 1**: `a == b` → Print 'Bob'
   - **Case 2**: `a == 1` → Print 'Alice'
   - **Case 3**: `b == 1` → Print 'Bob'
   - **Case 4**: `a % 2 == 1` → Print 'Bob'
   - **Case 5**: `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1` → Print 'Alice'
   - **Case 6**: `a > b` → Print 'Bob'
   - **Default Case**: Print 'Alice'

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The optimal strategy for this game involves understanding that the player who faces a situation where their wallet has an odd number of coins can force the opponent into a losing position.
   - Specifically, if a player has an odd number of coins, they can always force the opponent into a situation where they have an even number of coins, eventually leading to a win.
   - Conversely, if a player has an even number of coins, they are at risk of being forced into a situation where they have an odd number of coins, potentially leading to a loss.

4. **Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement align with the logic implemented in the function.
   - For instance, when `a == 1`, Alice will always win because she can force Bob into a situation where he has 0 coins.
   - When `a % 2 == 1`, Bob will always win because he can force Alice into a situation where she has 0 coins.
   - The other conditions also correctly reflect the optimal strategy.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the optimal strategy for the game. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
