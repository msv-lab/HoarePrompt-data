Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
2. The logic for determining whether it's AM or PM is correct:
   - If the hour `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, it sets `day` to 'PM', and specifically checks if `h` is 12 to switch back to 'AM'.
3. The program uses `f-string` formatting to ensure that both the hour and minute are displayed with leading zeros if necessary.
4. The program processes each test case correctly and prints the result in the required format.
5. The program does not return any value, but this is acceptable since the problem statement does not require a return value.

Based on the above reasoning, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
