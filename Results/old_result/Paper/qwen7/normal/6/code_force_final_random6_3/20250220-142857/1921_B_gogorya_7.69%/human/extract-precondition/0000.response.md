Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains a positive integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; the second line contains a string s of length n consisting of '0' and '1', indicating the initial state of the boxes; the third line contains a string f of length n consisting of '0' and '1', indicating the desired state of the boxes. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
