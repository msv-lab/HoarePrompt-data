Output State: **`cur_arr` must be empty, `xor` is the result of XORing all elements in the original `cur_arr`, `new_arr` contains all the elements that satisfied the condition (i.e., their `bit`-th bit is 0) in the order they were encountered, and `thing1` is -1.**

Explanation: The line `thing1 = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `thing1`. This does not affect the values of `cur_arr`, `xor`, or `new_arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
