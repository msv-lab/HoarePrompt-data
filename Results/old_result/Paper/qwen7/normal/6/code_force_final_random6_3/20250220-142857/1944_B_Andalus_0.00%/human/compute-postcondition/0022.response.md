Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), as indicated by `range(1, n)`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is an integer.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `ldb` contains the value of `lft[i]` if `i` is 1 and `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `sng` contains the element `lft[i]` if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. If neither condition is met, no changes occur to `ldb` and `sng`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be less than `n`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was previously `k`, it will now be `k + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `ldb` and `sng` may or may not change based on the conditions given, but since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, we do not change `ldb` and `sng`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 1, and `ldb` and `sng` remain as per the previous conditions.** 

To express this clearly:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 1, and `ldb` and `sng` remain as per the previous conditions.**
