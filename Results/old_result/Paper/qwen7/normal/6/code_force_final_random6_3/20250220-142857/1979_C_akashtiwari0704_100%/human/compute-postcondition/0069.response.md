Based on the initial state provided:

- `bets` is at least the total number of iterations (N).
- `i` is equal to N.
- `sumo` is the cumulative sum of `prod // a[i]` for each iteration.
- Each element in the list `a` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for the corresponding index `i`.
- The current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

The code snippet is simply printing `-1`.

Given the information, the value of `i` is `N`, but the specific values of `prod`, `a`, and `sumo` are not explicitly provided. However, these details do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Output: **-1**
