Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `r` is 0, `f` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether any two consecutive elements in the list `num` are different, `num` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `j` is `n - 2`, `n` remains unchanged, and either `n` is 1 or `f` is 1.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `n == 1 or f == 1` is true or false, the values of `t`, `r`, `f`, `num`, `j`, and `n` remain as specified in the precondition. Specifically, `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `r` remains 0, `f` indicates whether any two consecutive elements in `num` are different, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input string, `j` is `n - 2`, and `n` does not change.
