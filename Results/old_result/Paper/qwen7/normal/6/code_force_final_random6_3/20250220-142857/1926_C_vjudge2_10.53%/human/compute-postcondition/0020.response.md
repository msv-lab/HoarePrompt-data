Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < 10`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 1
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer is an input integer from the user
   - `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` filled with zeros
   - `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` filled with zeros
   - `i` is 2
   - `sum_values[2]` is 1

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.
   - The other variables (`total`, `t`, `numbers`, `values`, `sum_values`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`total` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer is an input integer from the user, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 3, `sum_values[2]` is 1**
