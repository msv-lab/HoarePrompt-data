Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `l1` is converted to an integer `n`, `k` is now equal to `k0` (which is initially `k`) right-shifted by the number of iterations of the loop, `arr` is a list containing the integers from `0` to the number of iterations - 1, `i` is equal to the number of iterations.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `k` is non-zero. Each iteration of the loop checks if the least significant bit of `k` is 1 using `k & 1 == 1`. If it is, the current value of `i` is appended to `arr`. Then, `k` is right-shifted by one bit (`k = k >> 1`), and `i` is incremented by one (`i += 1`). After the loop completes, `k` will be 0, and `arr` will contain all the values of `i` from `0` to the number of iterations minus one.
