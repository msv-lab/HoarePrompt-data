Output: **1**

Explanation: The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `i`. However, the specific values of these variables are not explicitly given. The print statement simply outputs the number 1, which does not depend on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, or `i`. Therefore, regardless of the values of `n` and `m`, the output will always be 1.
