### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code against the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
- The friendship value of a pair of friends increases by 1 for each excursion they are chosen.
- The probability of choosing any pair in each excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   ```python
   for i in range(int(input())):
       n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
       M = 10 ** 9 + 7
       c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
       s = 0
       a = 0
   ```
   - \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) are read from input.
   - \( M \) is set to \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - \( c \) is the modular inverse of \( n \times (n - 1) \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - \( s \) and \( a \) are initialized to 0.

2. **Reading and Summing Friendship Values**:
   ```python
   for i in range(m):
       u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
       a += f
   ```
   - For each of the \( m \) pairs, the friendship value \( f \) is added to \( a \).

3. **Calculating the Expected Value**:
   ```python
   for i in range(k):
       s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
   ```
   - Here, \( s \) is updated in a way that doesn't reflect the correct expected value calculation.
   - \( c \) is used incorrectly in the summation, and the logic doesn't account for the probability of choosing each pair.

4. **Output**:
   ```python
   print(s % M)
   ```

#### Correct Approach:
1. **Total Number of Possible Pairs**:
   - The total number of possible pairs is \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2} \).

2. **Expected Increase in Friendship Values**:
   - For each pair of friends, the expected increase in friendship value per excursion is \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - The expected value for each pair of friends is \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \times f \).

3. **Summing the Expected Values**:
   - Sum the expected values for all pairs of friends to get the total expected value.

#### Correct Implementation:
```python
from math import comb

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        total_pairs = comb(n, 2)
        s = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            s += f
        expected_value = (k * s) // total_pairs
        print(expected_value % M)
```

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It uses the modular inverse incorrectly and does not account for the probability of choosing each pair. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
**False**
