Output State: **`l` is 4, `r` is 3, `st` is 3, `end` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `r` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 3. The other variables (`l`, `st`, and `end`) remain unchanged. The initial state of `end` being "increased by 1" implies that `end` was originally 1 less than its current value, which is now 2.
