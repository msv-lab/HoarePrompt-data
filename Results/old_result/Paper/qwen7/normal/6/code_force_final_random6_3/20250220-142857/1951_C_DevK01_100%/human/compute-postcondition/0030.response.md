Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input string, `n` is the first element of `L`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `q` is calculated as `int(math.ceil(k / m))`.**

In this output state, the variable `q` is updated to the ceiling value of `k / m`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
