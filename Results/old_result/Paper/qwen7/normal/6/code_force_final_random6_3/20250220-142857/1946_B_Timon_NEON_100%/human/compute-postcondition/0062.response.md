Postcondition: `segments_variants` is a list of segments, `max_segment` is the best segment found so far based on the sum comparison, and `max_sum` remains -1. If `new_segment` is non-empty, `segments_variants` now contains either `max_segment + [i - 1]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]`, depending on whether `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`; `max_segment` is updated to the better segment found (with its first element incremented by `arr[i]`); `new_segment` is an empty list. If `new_segment` is empty, `segments_variants` remains unchanged, and `max_segment` is updated based on the current element of `arr` and its index, with `new_segment[0]` increased by `arr[i]`.
