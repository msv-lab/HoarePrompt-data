### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup**: The function initializes the first element of the row to 1 and increments the next `d-1` elements by 2.
2. **Min Heap Initialization**: A min heap is created using the first `d` elements of the row.
3. **Heap Operations**: For each element from `d` to the end of the row, the function pops the smallest element from the heap, checks if it is within the required distance, and then updates the current element in the row.
4. **Return Value**: The function returns the last element of the row, which represents the total cost of placing supports in the row.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**: The function reads the dimensions and the grid of river depths.
2. **Cost Calculation**: For each row, it calls `func_1` to calculate the cost of placing supports.
3. **Total Cost Calculation**: It calculates the sum of costs for every consecutive `k` rows and stores these sums in `total_costs`.
4. **Output**: It prints the minimum value from `total_costs`.

#### Correctness of the Program:
1. **Distance Constraint**: The function `func_1` ensures that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d` by maintaining a min heap. This is crucial because it guarantees that the closest support is always considered when placing a new support.
2. **Support Placement**: The function correctly places supports in the first and last columns of each row, as required.
3. **Heap Optimization**: The use of a min heap ensures that the cost calculation is efficient and adheres to the distance constraint.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The original assessment incorrectly identified issues that do not exist in the provided code.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem statement.
