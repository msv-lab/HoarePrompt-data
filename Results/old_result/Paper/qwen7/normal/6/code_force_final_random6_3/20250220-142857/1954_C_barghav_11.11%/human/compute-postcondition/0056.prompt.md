Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(a)`, and `a` will be a list of integers where each element has been transformed according to the specified rules. Specifically, for the first half of the list (up to the middle), the elements will be swapped such that the smaller value moves to `b` and the larger value remains in `a`. For the second half of the list, the elements will also be swapped but in reverse order, meaning the larger value moves to `b` and the smaller value remains in `a`.

This transformation ensures that after the loop completes, the list `a` is modified based on the comparison and swapping logic described, with `i` reflecting the total length of the list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(b)):
    print(b[i], end='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `b` is a non-empty list

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `b` must be a non-empty list with at least 2 elements

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `b` must be a non-empty list with at least 2 elements




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
