Output State: **`index` is 1, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[index]`**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to the variable `t`. The index variable is incremented by 1 because `data[index]` was accessed, updating its value to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
