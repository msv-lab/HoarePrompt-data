Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum number \( k \) of non-overlapping segments in an array such that the bitwise OR of the XORs of these segments is less than or equal to \( x \).
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(arr, x)**: This function is supposed to call `find_max` with the appropriate bit position (31 in this case).
   - **find_max(cur_arr, bit)**: This function processes the array `cur_arr` bit by bit starting from the most significant bit (`bit = 31`) down to the least significant bit (`bit = 0`). It tries to split the array into segments where the bitwise AND of the XORs of these segments is less than or equal to \( x \).

3. **Execution Summary Analysis**:
   - **func_1** calls `find_max` with the entire array and the highest bit position (31). This is the correct approach because it starts checking from the most significant bit.
   - **find_max** iterates over the array, splitting it into segments based on the current bit position. If the current XOR value does not have the current bit set, it adds the XOR value to the new array. This effectively groups elements with the same prefix in terms of their binary representation up to the current bit.
   - The function then recursively checks the next bit for the new array and the original array. If the current bit of \( x \) is set, it takes the maximum of the results from the recursive calls; otherwise, it uses the result from the new array.
   - The base case of the recursion (`bit == -1`) returns the length of the array, indicating that no further bit operations are needed.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `find_max` correctly handles the bit-by-bit processing and segment splitting.
   - The recursive calls ensure that the function considers all possible segmentations while adhering to the constraints.
   - The final result from `func_1` is the maximum \( k \) that satisfies the condition, which aligns with the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the provided implementation appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
