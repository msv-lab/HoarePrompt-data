Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if there exists a template such that both `a` and `b` match it, but `c` does not.
   - It iterates over each character of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` up to length `n`.
   - If for any index `i`, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]`, it immediately returns 'YES'.
   - If no such index is found, it returns 'NO'.
   - This logic correctly identifies if there is a template that satisfies the conditions for `a` and `b` but fails for `c`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.
   - This function correctly handles multiple test cases and ensures the results are printed in the required format.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to check for the existence of a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.
   - It processes multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.
   - The final output matches the expected format.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic and handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
