Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, `l` is 0, `r` is at least 1, `mid` is (0 + (n - 1)) // 2, `mid` is updated to (l + r) // 2**.

Explanation: The variable `mid` is recalculated as `(l + r) // 2`. Given that `l` is 0 and `r` is at least 1, `mid` becomes `(0 + (n - 1)) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
