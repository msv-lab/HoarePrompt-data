Postcondition: `i` is either 2, 4, or 6; `len(a)` must be greater than 6; `a` remains unchanged; `ans` is 2 if the substring `s` of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3 (unless the index 2 is out of bounds) is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1; `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3.
