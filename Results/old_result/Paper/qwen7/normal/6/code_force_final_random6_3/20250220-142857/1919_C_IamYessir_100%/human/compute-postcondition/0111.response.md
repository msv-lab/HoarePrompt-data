Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the last element of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `a` to the variable `x`. However, since the initial state does not provide any information about the list `a`, we cannot determine the exact value of `x`. We only know that `x` is now the last element of `a`. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
