The function `calculate_score` accepts a parameter `start_pos`, which is an integer indicating the starting position in the lists `a` and `p`. It calculates the sum of elements in the list `a` from the index `start_pos - 1` to the position determined by following the permutation `p` for `k` steps. If a cycle is detected during the process, it accounts for the cycle to compute the final score. The function returns the total score as an integer.
