Functionality: **The function accepts a `Tree` object `tree`, an integer `s` representing the starting vertex, and an integer `x` representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing specified edges. It returns a tuple containing the number of good components for vertex `s` and the remaining size of all its descendant components.**
