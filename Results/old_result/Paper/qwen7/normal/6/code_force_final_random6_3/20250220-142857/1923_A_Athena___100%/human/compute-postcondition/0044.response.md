Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `a and a[0] == 0`.
   - The loop continues as long as `a` is not empty (`a` is truthy) and the first element of `a` is 0.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list with its first element now being the second element of the original list.
   - This implies that `a[0]` was the second element of the original list, and it must be 0.

3. **Determine what needs to change**:
   - For the loop to continue, `a` must not be empty and `a[0]` must be 0.
   - Since `a[0]` is already 0 (it was the second element of the original list and must be 0), the only thing that can change is `a` itself. Specifically, `a` must not be empty.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - To ensure the loop executes again, `a` must still exist and be non-empty. 

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `a` must not be empty.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a non-empty list with its first element being the second element of the original list, which must be 0**
