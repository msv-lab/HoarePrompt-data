Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `range(n * 2)`. This means the loop will run as long as `i < n * 2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `t` remains the same.
   - `ans` is the sum of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.
   - `lst` does not contain the element at index 2.
   - We either remove the second element from `lst` or break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be the current value of `i` plus 1.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `ans` remains unchanged.
   - The condition `lst` does not contain the element at index 2 remains the same.
   - The condition about removing the second element from `lst` or breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement remains the same.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - The only variable that changes is `i`, which is incremented by 1.
   - `n` is not specified to change, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is the current value of `i` + 1, `t` remains the same, `ans` remains the same, `lst` does not contain the element at index 2, and we either remove the second element from `lst` or break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
