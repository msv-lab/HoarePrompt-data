Output State: **`hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `hcf` and `num`, and `num` is `numbers[2]`; `hcf` is updated to the GCD of `hcf` and `num`.**

Explanation: The code updates `hcf` to be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of its current value and `num`. Since `num` is `numbers[2]`, the new value of `hcf` is the GCD of `hcf` and `numbers[2]`. The initial state of `hcf` being the GCD of `hcf` and `num` remains valid, and now `hcf` is specifically updated to reflect this new GCD calculation.
