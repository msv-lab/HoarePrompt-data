Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` + 2, `n` must be at least 1, `x` is either set to infinity (float('inf')) or reassigned to the last element of list `a`, `y` is either unchanged (float('inf')) or set to the last element of list `b`, and `b` is unchanged except for the last element which now contains the value of `lit[i-1]`, and `lit` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Since `i` was initially equal to the length of list `b` + 1, after appending, `i` becomes equal to the length of list `b` + 2. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
