Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but works with predefined variables n, t, u, v, and a list of integers for the starting node(s). It returns "error" if n is less than 2 or greater than 2 Ã— 10^5, t is not equal to 1, u or v is less than 1 or greater than n, or the list of starting nodes does not contain exactly one integer within the range 1 to n. Otherwise, it returns information about the valid inputs.**
