Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 998\), `n` is the minimum of the original `n` and \(2 * k - 2\), and `k` is an integer read from standard input. The condition `n == k` either remains unchanged or is maintained as per the else part, which does not alter the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.**
