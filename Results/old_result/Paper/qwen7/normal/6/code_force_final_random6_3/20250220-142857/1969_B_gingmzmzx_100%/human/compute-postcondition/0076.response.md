Output State: **`s` is a non-empty list of integers; `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1; `ans` is equal to 2 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is 1, or `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]` where `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in the list `s`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0` checks if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. If it is, `ans` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged (incremented by 0). The initial state of `ans` being 1 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0, or incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]` where `zeroes` is the number of zeroes in the list `s`, is preserved. Therefore, `ans` is now either 2 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0, otherwise it is 1. All other variables remain in their initial states.
