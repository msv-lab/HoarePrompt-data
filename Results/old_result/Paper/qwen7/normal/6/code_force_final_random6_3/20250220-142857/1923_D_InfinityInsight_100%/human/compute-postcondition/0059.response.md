Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `x` is left[3] - a[3] - 1, `inx` is the last element of the list at index `i - 1`, `inx` is equal to `inx2`**

Explanation: The code `inx = inx2` assigns the value of `inx2` to `inx`. The other variables remain unchanged. `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `x` is calculated as `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx` is the return value of `func_1(left, x)`, and now `inx` is equal to `inx2`.
