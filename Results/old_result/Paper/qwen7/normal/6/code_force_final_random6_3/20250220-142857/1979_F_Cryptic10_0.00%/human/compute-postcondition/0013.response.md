Output State: **`path` is now ['v'], `remaining_vertices` does not contain the vertex `v`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block without changing the values of `path`, `remaining_vertices`, or `d`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and the only change is that we break out of the loop or conditional block.
