Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an integer from the input split, `space_x` is equal to `x`.**

Explanation: The code `space_x = x * 1` simply assigns the value of `x` to `space_x`. Since `x` is an integer from the input split, `space_x` now holds the same value as `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
