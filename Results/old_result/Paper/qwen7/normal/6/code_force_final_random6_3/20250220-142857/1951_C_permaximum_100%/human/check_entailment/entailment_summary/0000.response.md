Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines the function `func_1` which takes the necessary parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`.
2. It uses a priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently get the lowest price tickets first.
3. For each day, it calculates the effective price after considering any previous price increases.
4. It determines the number of tickets to buy each day, ensuring it does not exceed `m` and does not exceed the remaining `k` tickets needed.
5. The total cost is updated accordingly, and the process continues until `k` tickets are purchased.
6. The function returns the total cost, which matches the requirement of finding the minimum amount of money needed to purchase exactly `k` tickets.

Given the execution summary and the provided reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
