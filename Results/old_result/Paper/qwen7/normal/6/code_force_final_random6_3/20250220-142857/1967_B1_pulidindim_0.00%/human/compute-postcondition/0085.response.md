Postcondition: `t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 4, `n` is the new integer input split from `input().split()`, `m` is at least 3, `count` is 1, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / (m + 1)`, and if `g` is less than `countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `g` is not less than `countmins`, no changes are made to the variables.
