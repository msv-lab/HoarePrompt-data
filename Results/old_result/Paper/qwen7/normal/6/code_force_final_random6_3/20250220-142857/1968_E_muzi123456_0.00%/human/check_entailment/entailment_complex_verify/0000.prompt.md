You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1', end=' ')
            print(i)
        print(' ')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1', end=' ')
            print(i)
        
        print(' ')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3, inclusive, `i` is equal to `n`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `n` retains its original input integer value as it is only assigned a new value inside the loop but does not get decremented or modified otherwise. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n` inclusive, and after all iterations, `i` will reach `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases defined by the integer `t`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints a line containing `n` occurrences of '1' followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`, each separated by a space. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that `t` is set to 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for any \(n > 2\). 

For \(n = 2\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
```
This is correct as the set of Manhattan distances is \(\{0, 1\}\), which has a size of 2.

However, for \(n > 2\), the program simply prints the coordinates \((1, i)\) for \(i\) from 1 to \(n\). This results in the set of Manhattan distances being \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\), but it misses out on other possible distances, such as those involving cells on the diagonal or near-diagonal positions. For example, for \(n = 3\), the correct set of distances should include 3 (as seen in the example output), but the program only includes 0, 1, and 2.

A correct approach would involve strategically placing cells to maximize the number of distinct distances. For instance, for \(n = 3\), the correct output should include cells like \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\) to achieve the set \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for \(n > 2\), making it incorrect.
