Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, and the final value of `i` is `n`. The variable `cou` remains 0 throughout the loop's execution.**

Explanation: Given the loop structure, the loop will continue to increment `i` until it reaches `n + 1`. During each iteration, `cou` is only incremented if `freq[i]` is 1, but since the loop breaks when `cou` reaches 2 or `freq[i]` becomes 0, and given the conditions provided, `cou` never reaches 2 within the specified iterations. Therefore, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be `n`, and `cou` will still be 0.
