Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`, `len(num)`, and the step `-1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being set to `len(num) - 1`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

4. **Adjust the state of `num`**: Since the loop depends on `len(num)`, we need to ensure that `num` is a valid integer such that its length is at least 1. This is because if `num` is an empty string or has no digits, `len(num)` would be 0, and the loop would not execute.

5. **Initial value of `i`**: As mentioned, `i` starts at `len(num) - 1`.

6. **Final state of `i`**: The loop will terminate when `i` becomes `-1`. However, since we are asked to adjust the state for the loop to execute, we focus on the initial state of `i`.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `num` must be a non-empty string (or integer) to ensure `len(num)` is at least 1.
- `i` should start at `len(num) - 1`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

State: **`counter` is 0, `num` must be a non-empty string (or integer), `i` is `len(num) - 1`**
