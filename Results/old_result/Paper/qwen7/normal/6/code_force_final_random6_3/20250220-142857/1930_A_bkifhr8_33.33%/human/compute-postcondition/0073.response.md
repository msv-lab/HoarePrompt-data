Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `n * 2` (exclusive).

3. **Initial state of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is given as `(n * 2) + 1`.

4. **Determine if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range `0` to `n * 2` (exclusive). Given that `i` starts at `(n * 2) + 1`, it is already outside this range, meaning the loop will not execute.

5. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will not execute due to the initial value of `i`, we need to ensure that the initial value of `i` is within the valid range for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be within the range `0` to `n * 2`.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is within the range `0` to `n * 2`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is within the range 0 to n * 2, `t` is the same as before, `ans` is 0, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `l` by spaces**
