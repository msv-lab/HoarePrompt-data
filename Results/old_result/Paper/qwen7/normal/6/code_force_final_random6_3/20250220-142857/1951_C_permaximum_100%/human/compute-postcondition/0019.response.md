Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `tickets_bought < k`.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `total_cost` is increased by `price * tickets_to_buy`.
   - `pq` is a heap with one less element.
   - `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days.
   - `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day.
   - `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end.
   - `tickets_bought` is updated to `tickets_bought + tickets_to_buy`.
   - `price_increase` is `price_increase + tickets_to_buy + tickets_to_buy`.
   - `price` is the price popped from the heap.
   - `day` is the day popped from the heap.
   - `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`.
   - `price` is `price + price_increase`.
   - `tickets_bought` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`.

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop condition depends on `tickets_bought` and `k`. Therefore, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `tickets_bought` and `k`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `tickets_bought` must be less than `k` at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since `tickets_bought` is updated inside the loop, we need to ensure that after the update, `tickets_bought < k`.

Given the current state, let's assume the following:
- `tickets_bought` is currently some value \( x \).
- `k` is a fixed value.

For the loop to execute one more time, `x + tickets_to_buy` must be less than `k` after the update. Since `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - x`, we need to ensure that `x + (k - x) < k` is true, which simplifies to ensuring that `tickets_bought + tickets_to_buy < k`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `tickets_bought + tickets_to_buy < k`.

State: **`total_cost` is increased by `price * tickets_to_buy`, `pq` is a heap with one less element, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, `tickets_bought` is updated to `tickets_bought + tickets_to_buy`, `price_increase` is `price_increase + tickets_to_buy + tickets_to_buy`, `price` is the price popped from the heap, `day` is the day popped from the heap, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, `price` is `price + price_increase`, `tickets_bought` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`, and `tickets_bought + tickets_to_buy < k`**.
