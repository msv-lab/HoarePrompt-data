Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is the original value of `k`, `res` is the list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]`, and `re` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `res.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `a` to the list `res`. Given that `i` is 3, `res` will now contain `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `re` remain unchanged.
