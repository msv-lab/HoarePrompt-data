Output State: **`d` is `n-1`, `v` is a vertex present in `remaining_vertices`, `path` now contains all vertices added during the iterations plus the vertex `v`, `remaining_vertices` must contain at least one vertex, and we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The code snippet `path.append(v)` appends the vertex `v` to the list `path`. Since `v` is already a vertex present in `remaining_vertices`, appending it to `path` does not affect the condition that `remaining_vertices` must contain at least one vertex. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
