You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute `i` up to the value of `t` minus 1. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `t - 1`, `t` must still be within the range 1 to 1000, `x` will be the last input integer provided, and `y` will be `x - 1`.
    #
    #In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
    #- `i` will be set to `t - 1`.
    #- `t` remains within the range 1 to 1000.
    #- `x` will be the last integer input during the loop's execution.
    #- `y` will be `x - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` and then reads `t` integers `x`. For each `x`, it calculates `x - 1` and prints the result. After processing all inputs, the function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then iterates `t` times, reading an integer `x` for each iteration.

2. **Finding `y`**:
   - For each integer `x`, the program sets `y` to `x - 1`.
   - It then prints `y`.

3. **Checking the Condition**:
   - The condition to maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) needs to be considered.
   - If \(y = x - 1\), then \(\gcd(x, y)\) can be at most \(x-1\) (since the greatest common divisor of two consecutive integers is 1).
   - Therefore, \(\gcd(x, y) + y = \gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = 1 + (x-1) = x\).

4. **Maximizing the Expression**:
   - The expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized when \(\gcd(x, y)\) is maximized.
   - However, setting \(y = x - 1\) does not necessarily maximize \(\gcd(x, y)\). For example, if \(x = 10\), \(\gcd(10, 9) = 1\), but \(\gcd(10, 5) = 5\), which would give a higher value for \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10\).

5. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For \(x = 10\), the program outputs \(y = 9\), but the correct answer should be \(y = 5\) since \(\gcd(10, 5) = 5\) and \(5 + 5 = 10\).
   - For \(x = 21\), the program outputs \(y = 20\), but the correct answer should be \(y = 18\) since \(\gcd(21, 18) = 3\) and \(3 + 18 = 21\).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly find the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). It simply sets \(y = x - 1\), which does not guarantee the maximum value.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
