State: **`dp` is a list containing [1, 1], `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop starts with `i` in the range from 2 to `n + 1`.
2. For the loop to start executing, `i` must be at least 2.
3. The initial value of `dp` is given as a list containing [1, 1].
4. The variable `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to start, because the loop runs from 2 to `n + 1`, meaning `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to run at all.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being set to 2 (the starting point of the loop), and `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop can execute.
