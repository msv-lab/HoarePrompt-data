Output State: **`T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` to integers using map and lambda, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= mi` subtracts the value of `mi` (which is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`) from `a[r]`, where `r` is `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
