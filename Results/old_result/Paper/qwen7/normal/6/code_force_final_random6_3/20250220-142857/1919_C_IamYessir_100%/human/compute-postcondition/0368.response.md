Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is either an empty list or a list with one element, `b` is a non-empty list, `cp` is 0, `y` is the last element of the list `b`.**

The code assigns the last element of the list `b` to the variable `y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
