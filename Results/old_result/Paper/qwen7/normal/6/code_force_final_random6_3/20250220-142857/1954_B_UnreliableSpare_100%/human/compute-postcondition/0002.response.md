Output State: **`flag` is True, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, the array `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The line `flag = True` sets the variable `flag` to the boolean value `True`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or the array `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
