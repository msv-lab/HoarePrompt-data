The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it checks if the sum of \(a\) and \(b\) is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints 'bob '; otherwise, it prints 'alice'. After processing all test cases, it outputs the result for the last test case.
