Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`**

Explanation: The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing it from 1 to 2. The value of `t` remains unchanged as the code only modifies `index`. Since `t` was initially set to `data[index]` (which is `data[1]`), its value stays the same.
