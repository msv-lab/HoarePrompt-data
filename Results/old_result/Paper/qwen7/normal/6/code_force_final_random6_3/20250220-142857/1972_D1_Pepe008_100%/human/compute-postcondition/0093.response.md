Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in range(1, b + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the Current Values:**
   - From the given postcondition, `i` is currently `3`.
   - `b` must be at least `2`.

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < b + 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently `3`, the condition `i < b + 1` will be true if `b > 3`.

4. **Update the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by `1` in the next iteration, so `i` will become `4`.
   - `b` must still satisfy the condition `b > 3`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `info` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `suma` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `x` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - The current value of `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)` is `a - 3`, and since `i` is incremented, this value will change.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `b`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `info` is an integer `a`, `b` must be at least 4, `suma` is either `x + 2` or remains `0`, `i` is `4`, `x` is `1`, and the current value of `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)` is `a - 4`.**
