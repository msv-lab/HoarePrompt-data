Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `nums = sorted(map(int, nums))` converts each string in the set `nums` to an integer using `map(int, nums)`, and then sorts these integers in ascending order using `sorted()`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values in the set `nums`, the only thing we can definitively say is that `nums` is now a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
