Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` must be within the range 1 to 1000, `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x - 1`**

Explanation: The code `x = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `x`. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged, and `y` is updated to be `x - 1`.
