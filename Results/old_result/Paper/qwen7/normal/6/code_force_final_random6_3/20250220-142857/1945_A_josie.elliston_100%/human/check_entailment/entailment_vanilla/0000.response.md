### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of tents required for introverts, extroverts, and universals.
   - Each introvert needs a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert needs a tent with two others.
   - Universals can be placed in any configuration.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, we check if adding the universals can make it divisible by 3.
   - If the remainder when `extroverts` is divided by 3 plus the number of universals is less than 3, it means it's impossible to form complete groups of 3, and thus the function returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the division of `(extroverts + universals)` by 3.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function uses `func_1` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to form complete groups of 3, and thus it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` to get the total number of tents.

4. **Checking Edge Cases:**
   - For the input `(1, 4, 1)`, `func_1(4, 1)` should return `2` because 4 extroverts can share 2 tents (2 extroverts per tent), and 1 universal can share another tent with the remaining 2 extroverts. However, the function returns `-1` because it doesn't handle this case correctly.
   - For the input `(1, 1, 1)`, `func_1(1, 1)` should return `1` because 1 extrovert and 1 universal can share a tent, but the function returns `-1`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly handle cases where the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 but can still be grouped with universals.
   - The function `func_2` relies on `func_1` and thus inherits its issues.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program is incorrect because it fails to handle certain edge cases properly, leading to incorrect results for some test cases.
