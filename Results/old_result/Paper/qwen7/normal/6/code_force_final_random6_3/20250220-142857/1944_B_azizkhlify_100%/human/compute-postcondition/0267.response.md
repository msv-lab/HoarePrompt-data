Postcondition: **After the loop completes all its iterations, the output will be the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` printed in that order, followed by a space. The variable `i` will be set to `a[3]`, `res` will be an empty list, `re` will still be 2, and the upper limit `ul` is not equal to the lower limit `ur`.**
