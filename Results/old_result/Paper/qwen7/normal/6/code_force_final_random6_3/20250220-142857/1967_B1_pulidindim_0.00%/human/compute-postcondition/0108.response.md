Output State: `t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 4, `n` is the new integer input split from `input().split()`, `m` is at least 3, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is `n + (n / (m + 1) - 1) + (n / (4 * (m + 1)) - 3 / 5 + 1) + (n / ((m + 1) * (m + 1)) - (m + 1 - 1) / (m + 1) + 1)`, `countmins` is `m`, `g` is `n / ((m + 1) * (m + 1)) - m / (m + 1) + 1`.

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop, the variable `count` will be `m + 1`. The variable `ans` accumulates the sum of `g / count + 1` for each iteration from `count = 3` to `count = m + 1`. The variable `countmins` will be `m` when the loop ends. The variable `g` will be updated in the last iteration as `n / ((m + 1) * (m + 1)) - m / (m + 1) + 1`.
