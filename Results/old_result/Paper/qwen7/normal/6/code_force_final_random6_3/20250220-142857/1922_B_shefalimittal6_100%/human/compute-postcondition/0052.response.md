Postcondition: `ans` is `cnt * v[0] * (v[0] - 1) // 2 + v[1] * (v[1] - 1) * (v[1] - 2) // 6 + cnt * v[3] * (v[3] - 1) // 2 + v[3] * (v[3] - 1) * (v[3] - 2) // 6 + v[4] * (v[4] - 1) * (v[4] - 2) // 6`, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `cnt` is 2, `idx` is 7 if `v[4]` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `idx` is 3 + n.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `ans` will be updated based on whether `v[4]` is greater than or equal to 3. If `v[4]` is at least 3, `ans` includes an additional term `v[4] * (v[4] - 1) * (v[4] - 2) // 6`. The value of `i` remains 4, `n` must still be at least 4, `cnt` stays as 2, and `idx` is determined by `v[4]`: it is 7 if `v[4]` is at least 2, otherwise it is `3 + n`.
