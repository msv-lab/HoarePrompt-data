Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition given is that `i` is less than `n` and `n` is an integer equal to the input integer. Additionally, if `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is True, the program breaks out of the loop.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is less than `n`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - Since `n` is an integer equal to the input integer, it does not change within the loop.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1`.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an integer equal to the input integer**
