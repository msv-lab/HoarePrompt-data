Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in s`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `s`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `a` is a set containing the character `i`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are characters left in the string `s`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is being used as an iterator over the string `s`, after each iteration, `i` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - The string `s` will be one character shorter after each iteration because the current character `i` is processed.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - `s` will be the remaining part of the string after removing the first character.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `s` will be the string `s` without its first character.
- `i` will be the first character of the original string `s`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string (without its first character), `a` is a set containing the character `i` where `i` is the first character of the original string `s`**
