Output State: **`sz` is 0, `sng` has had its first element printed 0 times, `ldb` remains unchanged from its initial state, and `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` as per the initial conditions.**

Explanation: The code `sz = 0` sets the variable `sz` to 0. This changes the value of `sz` from its previous state (which was equal to `k`) to 0. The other variables (`sng`, `ldb`, and `rdb`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
