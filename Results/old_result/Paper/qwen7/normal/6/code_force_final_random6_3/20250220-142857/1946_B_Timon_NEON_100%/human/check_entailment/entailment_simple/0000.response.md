Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations. Each operation allows selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The solution aims to maximize the sum of the array.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The `func_2` function is supposed to find the segment with the maximum sum in the array.
   - The main logic involves calculating the maximum possible sum using the result from `func_2` and applying the power of 2 for the number of operations `k`.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - The function iterates through the array and keeps track of segments with positive sums.
   - It correctly identifies segments with the highest sum and ensures that the segment with the highest sum is returned.
   - However, the function does not handle negative segments effectively, as it resets `new_segment` whenever a negative number is encountered, which might not always yield the optimal segment.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main part of the code calculates the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.
   - The formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` is used to compute the maximum sum, where `max_segment[0]` is the sum of the best segment found by `func_2`.
   - This formula correctly accounts for the contribution of the best segment and the remaining elements after inserting the segment `k` times.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly applies the modulo operation to ensure the result fits within the required range.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases like empty segments and negative sums appropriately.

Given the analysis, the provided program seems to follow the correct logic for solving the problem. The `func_2` function might not be perfect in handling all edge cases, but the overall approach to solving the problem is sound.

Correctness: **True**
