Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` which iterates over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `i` is a character, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer, and `neg` is 1. Additionally, if `i` is the character '-', no changes are made to the variables.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, the next character `i` from the string `s` must be read. This means `i` should be updated to the next character in `s`.

4. **Adjust the States**: Since `i` is the only variable directly controlled by the loop, it needs to be updated to the next character in `s`. The other variables (`a`, `x`, and `neg`) remain unchanged as per the postcondition.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is the next character in the string `s`, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer, and `neg` is 1**.
