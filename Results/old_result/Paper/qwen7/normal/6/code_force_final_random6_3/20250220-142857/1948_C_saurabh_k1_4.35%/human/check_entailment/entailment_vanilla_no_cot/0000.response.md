Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Logic Error**: The program only checks the second-to-last column of the second row (`b[n - 2]`). If the arrow in this position is `<`, it prints 'No', otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. This logic is incomplete and incorrect because it does not consider all possible paths the robot can take to reach `(2, n)`.

2. **Missing Path Traversal**: The program does not simulate the movement of the robot through the grid to check if it can reach `(2, n)`. It only checks one specific condition which is insufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to simulate the robot's movement through the grid and check if it can reach the target cell `(2, n)` considering all possible paths.
