Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes that `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
2. `n` is equal to `k`, where `k` is an integer read from standard input.
3. `_` is explicitly defined as 1.
4. The `print` statement outputs the string `'YES'`.

Given these points, the `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`. The values of `t` and `n` do not affect the output of this specific print statement, as it is hardcoded to print `'YES'`.

Output: **'YES'**
