Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `rdb` contains the value of `rgt[2]`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the loop will execute one more time if `i` becomes 3 (i.e., `i` is incremented by 1).
   - Therefore, `i` will become 3.
   - The condition `n` must be at least 2 remains unchanged because it is a precondition for the loop to run.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` must still be at least 2.
   - `rdb` will contain the value of `rgt[3]` after the loop increments `i` from 2 to 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, and `rdb` contains the value of `rgt[3]`**
