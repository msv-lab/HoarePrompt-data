Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

# Annotated Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to `n`. During these iterations, the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` was never met for any `i` from `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, the function does not return 'YES' during the loop's execution. As a result, the function continues until the loop completes without returning 'YES', implying that for every `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, at least one of the following holds true: `a[i] == c[i]` or `b[i] == c[i]`.
    #
    #The final output state is that the function has completed all its iterations without returning 'YES', and for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the condition `a[i] == c[i]` or `b[i] == c[i]` is satisfied.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO', indicating that for every index i from 0 to n-1, the condition a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i] is satisfied, and the function did not return 'YES' during its execution.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, a, b, and c are strings of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be equal to 0, `n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the final input string stripped of leading trailing whitespace, `c` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration from 1 to `t`, `_` is `t`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0 because it decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the last inputs provided during the loop's execution. The `results` list will contain the outputs of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each of the `t` iterations.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: t is 0, n is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, a is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, b is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, c is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, results is a list containing the results of func_1(n, a, b, c) for each iteration from 1 to t, _ is t.
