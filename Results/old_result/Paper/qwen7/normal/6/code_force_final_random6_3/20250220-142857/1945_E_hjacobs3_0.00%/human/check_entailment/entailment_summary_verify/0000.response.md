Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues with the current implementation:

1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**: The provided function `func_1` performs a binary search but does not ensure that the permutation is rearranged to place `x` at the correct index before performing the search. The function only checks if `x` is present in the array and returns its index if found, or prints `0` if not found. This does not meet the requirement of rearranging the permutation.

2. **Swapping Logic Missing**: The function does not include logic to swap elements to ensure that `x` is placed at the correct index. The problem statement requires that the permutation be rearranged using at most two swaps to ensure that `p[l]` equals `x` after the binary search.

3. **Example Analysis**: Consider the example provided in the original assessment:
   - Input:
     ```
     3 3
     1 2 3
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     0
     ```
   - Actual Output:
     ```
     1
     1 2
     ```
   Here, the permutation is already sorted, and `x` (which is 3) is already in the correct position (`p[2]`). The program incorrectly prints `1` and suggests swapping `p[1]` and `p[2]`, which is unnecessary.

To fix this, the program needs to identify the correct position for `x` and perform the necessary swaps to place `x` at the correct index before performing the binary search. The current implementation does not address these requirements.

Final: **False**
