Postcondition: `k` is non-zero, `nums` is a deque with two fewer elements. If `b > 0`, then `k` remains unchanged, and `nums` is updated with the new leftmost element `b`. If `b <= 0`, then `ans` is incremented by 1 and `nums` is updated with the new leftmost element `b`. If `b <= 0`, then `ans` is incremented by 1, and `k` remains unchanged.
