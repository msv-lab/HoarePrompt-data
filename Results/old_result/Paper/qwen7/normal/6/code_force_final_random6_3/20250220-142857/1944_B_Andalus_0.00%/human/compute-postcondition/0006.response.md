Output State: **`T` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 5000, `_` is now 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `lft` is a sublist of `lst` containing the first `n` elements, `rgt` is a sublist of `lst` containing the remaining elements starting from index `n`, `ldb` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `ldb`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
