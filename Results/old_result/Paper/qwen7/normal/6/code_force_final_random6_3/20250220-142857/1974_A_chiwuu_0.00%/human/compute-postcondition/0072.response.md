Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y`. For each test case, if `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, it processes the values of `x` and `y` which are integers between 0 and 99, and returns different outputs based on specific conditions.**

However, since the function definition itself does not accept any parameters (`def func():`), the description should focus on the implied behavior based on the provided constraints and output cases.
