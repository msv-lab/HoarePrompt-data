### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be modified by replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. **Function `func_1()` Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`arr`).
   - It checks if the array is already non-beautiful by comparing consecutive elements. If any two consecutive elements are different, it sets `flag` to `False`.
   - If the array is beautiful (all consecutive elements are the same), it calculates the minimum length of any segment of consecutive identical elements.
   - If the array is beautiful, it prints `-1` because removing elements would be required to make it non-beautiful.
   - If the array is not beautiful, it prints the minimum length of any segment of consecutive identical elements, which represents the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly initializes variables and processes each test case.
   - The logic to check if the array is beautiful and to calculate the minimum segment length is implemented correctly.
   - The output is produced based on whether the array is beautiful or not.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where the array is already non-beautiful by setting `flag` to `False` and printing `-1`.
   - The code correctly calculates the minimum segment length when the array is beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The given annotated program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
