Output State: **j is n-2, f is 0 if there was any pair of non-identical consecutive elements in num, otherwise f remains 1.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `j` will be equal to `n-2` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-2`. The variable `f` will be `0` if at any point during the loop execution, the condition `num[j] != num[j + 1]` is met for any `j` (i.e., if there is any pair of non-identical consecutive elements in the list `num`). If no such pair is found, `f` will remain `1`.
