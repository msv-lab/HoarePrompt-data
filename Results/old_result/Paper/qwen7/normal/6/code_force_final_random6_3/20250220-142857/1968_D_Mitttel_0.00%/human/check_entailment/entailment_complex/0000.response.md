Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions and the rules of the game. It handles the scenario where a cycle might occur in the permutation and adjusts the score accordingly. The logic for handling cycles is sound and ensures that the score calculation is accurate even when the sequence repeats.
2. **Function `calculate_score`**: This function accurately computes the score for a given starting position. It properly accounts for cycles and ensures that the score is calculated correctly up to `k` steps. The logic for detecting and handling cycles is implemented correctly, and the score is computed based on the rules provided.
3. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case. The way it reads and processes the input is correct and ensures that the correct parameters are passed to `func_1`. The output is printed correctly for each test case.

Given the detailed annotations and the correctness of the logic in each function, the overall implementation meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
