Output State: `ind` is 12, `i` is 10, `p[1]` is 1, `p[4]` is 2, `p[6]` is 4, `p[9]` is 6.

To understand this output state, let's break down the loop's behavior:

- The loop runs with `i` starting from 1 and incrementing by 2 each time, up to `n-1`.
- On each iteration, `p[i]` is set to the current value of `ind`, and then `ind` is incremented by 2.
- Given that the loop executed 3 times initially, we can deduce that `n` is at least 11 (since the last value of `i` would be 9).

Continuing the pattern:
- After 4 iterations, `ind` would be 8 + 2 = 10, and `i` would be 10.
- `p[9]` would be set to `ind`, which is 10 - 2 = 8.

Thus, after all iterations, `ind` would be 12 (as it increments by 2 for each of the 5 iterations), `i` would be 10 (the last value of `i` before the loop exits), and `p` would contain the values set during each iteration as described.
