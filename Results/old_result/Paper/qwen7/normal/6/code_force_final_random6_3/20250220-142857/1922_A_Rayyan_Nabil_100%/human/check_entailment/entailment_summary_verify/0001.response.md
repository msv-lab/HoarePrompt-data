### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires checking if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, but string `c` does not. A template can consist of both lowercase and uppercase letters, with specific matching rules.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` currently checks if for every index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not match `c[i]`. This is not sufficient because it does not ensure that `a` and `b` match some template and `c` does not.
   - The function should instead check if there is any character in `a` and `b` that does not match `c` at the same index, but also ensure that `a` and `b` match some template and `c` does not.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

4. **Template Matching Logic**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if there exists a template where `a` and `b` match and `c` does not.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not cover this requirement. It only checks if `a` and `b` do not match `c` at the same index, which is insufficient.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to construct a template character by character, ensuring that for each position `i`:
     - If `a[i] == b[i]` and `a[i] != c[i]`, then the template character should be `a[i]` (lowercase).
     - If `a[i] != b[i]` and `a[i] == c[i]` or `b[i] == c[i]`, then the template character should be `a[i]` or `b[i]` respectively.
     - If none of the above conditions are met, the template character should be `a[i]` or `b[i]` such that the template does not match `c`.

6. **Current Implementation**:
   - The provided functions do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as stated. Specifically, `func_1` does not ensure that `a` and `b` match some template and `c` does not.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment is accurate. The given program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine if there exists a template such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine if there exists a template such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not.

Final: **False**
