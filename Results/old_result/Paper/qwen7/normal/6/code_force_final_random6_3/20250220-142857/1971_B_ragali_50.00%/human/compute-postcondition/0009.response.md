Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is the second element of the set `s`, `s` is a non-empty set, `a` is a set containing the elements 0, `i`, and `i` is added to the set `a`.**

Explanation: The code adds the element `i` to the set `a`. Since `a` originally contained the elements 0 and `i`, adding `i` again does not change the set `a` because sets do not allow duplicate elements. Therefore, `a` remains as a set containing the elements 0 and `i`.
