### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Input Handling:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
- It then reads the list of ticket prices for each of the `n` days.
- The function `func_1` is called with these parameters.

#### Function `func_1`:
- It initializes a priority queue `pq` with tuples containing the price and index of each day.
- It uses a while loop to buy tickets until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.
- Inside the loop:
  - It pops the smallest price from the priority queue.
  - It adds the current `price_increase` to the price.
  - It calculates the number of tickets to buy (`tickets_to_buy`) as the minimum of `m` and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
  - It updates the total cost by adding the product of the adjusted price and the number of tickets bought.
  - It increments `tickets_bought` by the number of tickets bought.
  - It increments `price_increase` by the number of tickets bought.
- After the loop, it returns the total cost.

#### Key Points:
1. **Priority Queue Initialization**: The priority queue is initialized with the prices and indices of the days. This ensures that the cheapest price is always considered first.
2. **Ticket Purchase Logic**: The logic correctly handles the purchase of tickets and the subsequent price increase. The loop continues until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` exceeds `n * m`, the program will still terminate because the loop condition `tickets_bought < k` will eventually fail when `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.
   - The program does not enter an infinite loop because the loop condition is checked against `tickets_bought`, which is incremented in each iteration.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly handles the scenario where `k` exceeds `n * m`. The loop will continue to buy tickets until `tickets_bought` equals `k`, even if `k` is larger than `n * m`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly states that the program will lead to an infinite loop if `k` exceeds `n * m`. The program actually terminates correctly in such cases.

**Final: True**
