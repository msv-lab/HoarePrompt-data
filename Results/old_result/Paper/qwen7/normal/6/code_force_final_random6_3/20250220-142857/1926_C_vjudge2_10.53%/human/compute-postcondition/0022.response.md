Output State: **`total` is 5, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer is an input integer from the user, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 4, `values[3]` is 3, `sum_values[2]` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is 4. Therefore, `total` becomes 5. The values of `t`, `numbers`, `values`, `sum_values`, and `i` remain unchanged. The specific values of `values[3]` and `sum_values[2]` are also preserved.
