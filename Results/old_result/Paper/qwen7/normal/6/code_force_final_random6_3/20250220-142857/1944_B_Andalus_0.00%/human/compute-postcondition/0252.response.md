Based on the initial state provided:

- The loop continues as long as there are elements in `sng` and `sz` is less than `k`.
- After all iterations, `sz` will be equal to the size of `sng`.
- The loop breaks once `sz` is no longer less than `k`.

The `print()` function is called without any arguments, which means it will print nothing. Since no variables or values are being printed, the output will be an empty print statement.

Output: **None**
