Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is an even integer, and `s` is 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, no change is made. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, no change is also made since the condition does not specify any action when `s` is 200 or more.
