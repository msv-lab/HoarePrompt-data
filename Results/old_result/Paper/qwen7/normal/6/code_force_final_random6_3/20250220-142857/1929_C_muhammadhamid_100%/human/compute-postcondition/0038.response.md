Output State: The loop will execute `x` times, with `i` ranging from 0 to `x-1`. After all iterations, `s` will be \(2^x - 1\), `k` will remain as the input integer, `x` will remain as the input integer, and `i` will be equal to `x-1`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `s` will undergo the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x` times, starting from `s = 1`. This results in `s` being transformed into \(2^x - 1\). The variable `i` will increment from 0 up to `x-1` during the loop, and thus will be equal to `x-1` after the loop completes. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
