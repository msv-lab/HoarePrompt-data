Postcondition: **`C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, otherwise it remains unchanged; `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `D[out_aa] > 0`, otherwise it is decreased by 2; `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `D[out_aa] > 0`, otherwise it is decreased by 2; `C[in_aa]` is incremented by 1 if `C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]`, otherwise `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1; if `C[in_aa] > 0`, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**
