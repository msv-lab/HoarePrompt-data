Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split, and `t` is adjusted based on whether it is divisible by 5 or not.**

Explanation: The code calculates `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4`. The value of `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, depending on whether `b * 2` is divisible by 5 or not. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
