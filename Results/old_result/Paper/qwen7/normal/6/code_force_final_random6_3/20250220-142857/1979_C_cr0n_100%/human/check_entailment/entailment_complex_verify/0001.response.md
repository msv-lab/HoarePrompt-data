### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program fails to handle cases where the total bet equals the winnings, which should result in `-1`. However, the assessment concludes that the program is incorrect due to this issue. Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem statement and the provided examples.

1. **Problem Statement**: The goal is to distribute coins such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. The program should print `-1` if no such distribution exists.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula \(\text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\gcd(a, b)}\).

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Reading Input**: It reads the number of outcomes \(N\) and the multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\).
   - **Calculating LCM**: It initializes `den` with the first multiplier and iteratively calculates the LCM of `den` and each subsequent multiplier.
   - **Distributing Coins**: It computes the required bet amounts for each outcome by dividing `den` by each multiplier. It then subtracts the sum of these bet amounts from `den` to get the remaining value.
   - **Output**: If the remaining value is non-positive, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the bet amounts.

Let's re-examine the examples provided:

- **Test Case 1**: \( N = 3 \), multipliers \( [3, 2, 7] \)
  - LCM of \( 3, 2, 7 \) is \( 42 \).
  - Bet amounts: \( 42 // 3 = 14 \), \( 42 // 2 = 21 \), \( 42 // 7 = 6 \).
  - Total bet: \( 14 + 21 + 6 = 41 \).
  - Winnings: \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \), \( 2 \times 21 = 42 \), \( 7 \times 6 = 42 \).
  - Condition satisfied: \( 41 < 42 \).

- **Test Case 2**: \( N = 2 \), multipliers \( [3, 3] \)
  - LCM of \( 3, 3 \) is \( 3 \).
  - Bet amounts: \( 3 // 3 = 1 \), \( 3 // 3 = 1 \).
  - Total bet: \( 1 + 1 = 2 \).
  - Winnings: \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \), \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \).
  - Condition satisfied: \( 2 < 3 \).

- **Test Case 3**: \( N = 5 \), multipliers \( [5, 5, 5, 5, 5] \)
  - LCM of \( 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 \) is \( 5 \).
  - Bet amounts: \( 5 // 5 = 1 \), \( 5 // 5 = 1 \), \( 5 // 5 = 1 \), \( 5 // 5 = 1 \), \( 5 // 5 = 1 \).
  - Total bet: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 \).
  - Winnings: \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \), \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \), \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \), \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \), \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \).
  - Condition not satisfied: \( 5 \not< 5 \).

In Test Case 3, the program correctly prints `-1` because the total bet equals the winnings, satisfying the requirement that the total bet must be strictly less than the winnings.

Given that the program correctly handles all provided examples and adheres to the problem statement, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided examples.
