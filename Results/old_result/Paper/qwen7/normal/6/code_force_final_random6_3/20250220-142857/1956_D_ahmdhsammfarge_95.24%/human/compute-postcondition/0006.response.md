Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, `r` is `r + 1`, `l` is `l + 1`, and `ops` is a list containing `[[r + 1, r + 1], [r + 1, l + 1]]`.**

Explanation: The function `func_2(r, l, ops)` is called with the parameters `r`, `l`, and `ops`. However, the function `func_2` is not defined in the provided code snippet. Without the definition of `func_2`, we cannot determine what changes it might make to the variables. Given the information provided, the only updates to the variables are that `r` is incremented by 1 and `l` is incremented by 1. The length of the list `lst` and the contents of `ops` remain unchanged.
