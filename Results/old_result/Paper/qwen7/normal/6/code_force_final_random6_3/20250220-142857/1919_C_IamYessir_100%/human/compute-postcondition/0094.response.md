Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, depending on whether the list `a` is empty or not, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, depending on whether list `b` is empty or not; `a` is now a list containing the last element of `a` appended with the element at index `i-1` of the original `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of `lit` to the list `a`. Given that `i` was initially 1, after executing the code, `i` is incremented to 2 (assuming `i` is incremented automatically in the context, though it's not explicitly shown in the code snippet). The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. The value of `x` and `y` also remain unchanged unless `a` or `b` were empty lists and now contain elements. However, since the problem does not specify the nature of `lit`, we assume `a` is updated with the new element.
