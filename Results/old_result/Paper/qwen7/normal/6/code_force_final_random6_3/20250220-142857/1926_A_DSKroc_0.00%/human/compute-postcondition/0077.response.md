Postcondition: **After the if-else block executes, `ac` will be equal to the total number of 'A' characters in the string `s`, `q` will be equal to `t-1`, `bc` will be equal to the total number of non-'A' characters in the string `s`, and `s` will be the original input string. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, then `ac` remains unchanged and `bc` remains unchanged. If `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`, then `ac` remains unchanged and `bc` remains unchanged.**
