Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `res` is either -3 or -1, `k` is either `k - dif * 3` or 0, `ans` is either `2 * dif` or `dif` or 0, and if `dif` equals 0, then `res` is set to -2, `k` remains either `-dif * 2` or 0, and `ans` remains either `dif` or 0.
