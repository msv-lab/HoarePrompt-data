Output State: **`i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block present in the given code snippet, the only affected state is that the execution would break out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. The value of `i` remains unchanged as 1.
