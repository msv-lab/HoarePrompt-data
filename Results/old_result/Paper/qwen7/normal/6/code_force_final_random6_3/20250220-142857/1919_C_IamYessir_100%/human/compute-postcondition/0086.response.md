Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, depending on whether the list `a` is empty or not, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, depending on whether list `b` is empty or not; list `a` now contains the element `a[i]` which is `a[1]` (since `i` was 1 before the append operation).**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` was 1 initially, `a.append(lit[1])` adds `lit[1]` to the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
