Output State: **`n` is the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the input string after stripping, `b` is an input string of length `n`, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `_` is 1, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().strip()` reads an input string, strips it of leading and trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `a`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
