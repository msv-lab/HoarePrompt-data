Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and the value of `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < int(input())`. 

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is the first integer input split from `t`
   - `m` is the second integer input split from `t`
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the condition `i < int(input())` must still hold true.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect the loop continuation condition directly.

6. **Formulate the new state**: The new state should reflect the updated value of `i` and maintain the original values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input split from `t`, `m` is the second integer input split from `t`, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `i` is 1 more than the previous value of `i`**.
