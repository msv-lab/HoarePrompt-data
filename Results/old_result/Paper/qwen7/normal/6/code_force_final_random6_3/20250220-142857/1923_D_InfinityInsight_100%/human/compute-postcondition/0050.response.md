Output State: **`i` is 2, `ans[2]` is 2, `x` is `left[1] - a[1] - 1`, `inx2` is `last[0]`, `inx` is `last[0`**.

Explanation: The code `ans[i] = i + 1 - inx` updates the value of `ans[i]` to `i + 1 - inx`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, the new value of `i` becomes 2. The value of `ans[2]` is set to `1 + 1 - inx`, which simplifies to `2 - inx`. Since `inx` is `last[0]`, `ans[2]` becomes `2 - last[0]`. The values of `x`, `inx2`, and `inx` remain unchanged as they are not directly involved in the operation.
