Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `ul` is increased by 2, `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0**

Explanation: The variable `ul` is incremented by 2. The initial values of `i`, `n`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still `n`, `n` remains an integer between 1 and 5000, and `l[a[i] - 1]` is still 0.
