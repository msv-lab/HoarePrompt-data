Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input string, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `N` has `n` elements, and either:
- `n * m` equals `k`, in which case `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- `n * m` does not equal `k`, in which case `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M` excluding the last element, `w` is the last element of `N` before it was popped, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.
