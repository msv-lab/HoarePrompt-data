Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer input split from `t`, and `m` is the second integer input split from `t`; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`; `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `p` is the length of `l`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the binary string representation of the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and assigns it to `p`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
