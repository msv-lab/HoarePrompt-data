Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `A` is the first integer entered and is even.
- `B` is the second integer entered.
- `C` is the third integer entered.
- The condition \(B * 2 \geq C\) still holds true.

We need to determine the value of `int(A * C / 2)`.

Since `A` is an even integer and `C` is an integer, the expression `A * C / 2` will result in an integer value because `A` being even ensures that `A / 2` is an integer. Therefore, `int(A * C / 2)` simply returns the value of `A * C / 2`.

Given the condition \(B * 2 \geq C\), this does not affect the calculation of `A * C / 2`, but it ensures that `C` is not too large relative to `B`.

Thus, the output will be the value of `A * C / 2`.

Output: **int(A * C / 2)**
