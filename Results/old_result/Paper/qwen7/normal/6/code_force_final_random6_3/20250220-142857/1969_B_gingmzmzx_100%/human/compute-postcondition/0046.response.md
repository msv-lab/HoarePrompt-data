Output State: **`cnt` is [1, 1], `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `ans` is 2, `s` must contain at least one element, and `c` is the first element of the updated list `s`**.

Explanation: The code `ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0` checks if `cnt[1]` (which is 1) is greater than 0. Since it is, `ans` is incremented by 1, making `ans` equal to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
