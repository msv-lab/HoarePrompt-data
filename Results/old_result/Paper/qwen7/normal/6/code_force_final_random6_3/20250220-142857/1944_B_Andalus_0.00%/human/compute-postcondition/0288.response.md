Output State: **`sng` is an empty iterable, `sz` is `sz` + 1, and if `sz` has a value greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 1. The state of `sng` remains an empty iterable, and the condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement depends on whether `sz` is now greater than or equal to `k`.
