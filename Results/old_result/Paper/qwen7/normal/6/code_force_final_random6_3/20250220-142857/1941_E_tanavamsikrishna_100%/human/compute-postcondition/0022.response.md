Output State: **`i` is `d-1-1`, `d` must be greater than 1, `len(row)` must be greater than `d-1`, and `min_heap` contains the tuples `(e[0], 0)` and `(row[i-1], i-1)`**.

Explanation: The code pushes a new element `(row[i], i)` onto the min heap using `heappush`. Since `i` was initially `d-1`, after the operation, `i` becomes `d-1-1` (or `d-2`). The min heap now contains the original tuple `(e[0], 0)` and the new tuple `(row[i-1], i-1)`, which simplifies to `(row[d-2], d-2)`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
