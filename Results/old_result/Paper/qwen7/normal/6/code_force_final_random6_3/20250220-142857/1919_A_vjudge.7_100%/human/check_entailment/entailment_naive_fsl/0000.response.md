Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins in both wallets. According to the problem description, the player who ends up with an odd number of coins after all optimal moves will win. However, the program checks if the sum of coins `a + b` is even or odd and decides the winner based on that. This logic is incorrect because the key is not the parity of the total sum but the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `1 1`
- Expected Output: `Bob`
- Program Output: `Bob`

This case works correctly. However, consider another case:
- Input: `1 2`
- Expected Output: `Alice`
- Program Output: `Bob`

In this case, Alice can always win by swapping wallets and removing a coin until Bob is left with 1 coin, making Alice the winner. The program incorrectly outputs `Bob`.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and should be marked as incorrect.
