Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `1`, `i` is `i_end + 2` and less than `n`, and `sng` has appended the value of `lft[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `sng`. The variables `n` and `i` maintain their conditions from the initial state, and now `sng` includes the element `lft[i]`.
