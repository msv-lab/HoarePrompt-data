Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.**

Explanation: The code `s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)` assigns the value `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times to the variable `s`. The value of `t` is decreased by 1, and `n` remains an input integer. The initial state of `s` being 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times (if `n` is odd) or remaining unchanged (if `n` is even) is preserved.
