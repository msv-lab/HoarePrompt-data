### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is correctly defined to take parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. This matches the problem's requirements.
2. **Counter Initialization**: The code initializes counters for both `b` and the initial segment of `a` (first `m` elements). This is done correctly using `Counter(sorted(b))` and `Counter(sorted(a[:m]))`.
3. **Initial Matching Count**: The variable `sm` is used to keep track of the number of matching elements between the sorted segments of `a` and `b`. However, there is a critical issue here. The initial matching count should be based on the actual elements in `a` and `b`, not their sorted versions. Sorting `b` and `a[:m]` before counting matching elements can lead to incorrect results because it changes the relative order of elements, which is not relevant for the problem.
4. **Sliding Window Technique**: The code uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of `a` of length `m`. It updates the counter `ca` and adjusts the count `sm` as the window slides through the array. This part is generally correct but relies on the initial matching count being accurate.
5. **Condition Check**: The condition `if sm >= k:` checks if the current subsegment meets the requirement of having at least `k` matching elements with `b`. If true, it increments the answer `ans`. This condition is correct but again depends on the initial matching count being accurate.
6. **Edge Cases**: The code handles the edge case where the initial segment already meets the requirement, which is correctly accounted for in the first iteration of the loop. However, this edge case is only valid if the initial matching count is correctly computed.
7. **Output**: The function returns the count of good subsegments, which is printed in the main loop. This is correct.

Given the above analysis, the initial assessment is incorrect because the sorting step in the initialization of `ca` and `cb` leads to an incorrect count of matching elements. The program does not correctly compute the number of matching elements in the initial segment, which affects the subsequent sliding window calculations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the sorting step in the initialization of the counters, which distorts the actual count of matching elements.
