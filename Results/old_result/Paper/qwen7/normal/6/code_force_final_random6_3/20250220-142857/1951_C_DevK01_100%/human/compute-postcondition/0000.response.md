Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and now `t` is reduced by 1 because one test case is consumed.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since `t` was initially an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), after executing this line, `t` will now represent the number of test cases left, which is `t - 1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
