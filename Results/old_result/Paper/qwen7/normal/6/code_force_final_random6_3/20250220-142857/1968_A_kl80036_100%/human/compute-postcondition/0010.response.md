Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` must be within the range 1 to 1000, `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x - 1`.**

The code `y = x - 1` simply assigns the value of `x - 1` to `y`. Since `x` is an input integer and is greater than 1, `y` will be `x - 1`. All other variables (`i` and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
