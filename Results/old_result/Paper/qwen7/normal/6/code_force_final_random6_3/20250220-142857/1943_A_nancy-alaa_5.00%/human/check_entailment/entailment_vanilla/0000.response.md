Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `arr`.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Excludant (MEX):**
   - The goal is to find the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `c`.
   - The program iterates through the numbers from `0` to `n-1` to check if they are present in the `mpp` dictionary (which is a counter of the original array `arr`).
   - If a number `i` is not in `mpp`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - If a number `i` appears exactly once and `first` is already `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - If a number `i` appears exactly once and `first` is `False`, it sets `first` to `True`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation:**
   - The program attempts to find the MEX by iterating through numbers from `0` to `n-1` and checking their presence in the counter.
   - However, the logic for setting `first` to `True` and the subsequent condition checks are unnecessary and do not correctly simulate the game rules.
   - The program does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob, nor does it ensure that the final array `c` is constructed according to the game rules.

2. **Game Rules Not Followed:**
   - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, then remove it from `a`.
   - Bob can only pick an element from `a` and remove it.
   - The program does not simulate these turns or construct the array `c` accordingly.

3. **Output Does Not Match the Expected Behavior:**
   - The output of the program does not reflect the optimal strategy for both players to achieve the final MEX value.
   - The program does not handle the game's alternating turns and the specific rules for Alice and Bob.

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the program's logic and its failure to correctly simulate the game rules, the provided program is **incorrect**.

### Correctness: **False**
