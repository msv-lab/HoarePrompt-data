Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b = int(b)` converts the string `b` into an integer and assigns it back to `b`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `a`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 is still valid. The value of `a` is still an integer from the first input split, and `b` is now an integer from the second input split after conversion.
