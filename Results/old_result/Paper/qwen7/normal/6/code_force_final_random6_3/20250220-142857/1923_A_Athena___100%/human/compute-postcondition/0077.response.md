Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with the first element removed and the first element of `a` was 0, now the first element of `a` is removed, `res` is 0**.

The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the first element of `a` must be 0, after removing it, the first element of `a` no longer exists. All other variables remain unchanged.
