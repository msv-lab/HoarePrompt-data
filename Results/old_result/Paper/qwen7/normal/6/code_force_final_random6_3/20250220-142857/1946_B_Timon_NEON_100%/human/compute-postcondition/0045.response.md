Postcondition: `segments_variants` is a list of segments, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the current element of `arr` and its index with the first element increased by `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is the best segment found so far based on the sum comparison, and `max_sum` remains -1. If `new_segment` is non-empty, `new_segment` is added to `segments_variants` and `max_segment` is updated accordingly. If `new_segment` is empty, `segments_variants` remains unchanged, and `max_segment` is updated based on the current element of `arr` and its index.
