Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `t` is equal to `int(data[0])`, `idx` is 2, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    for _ in range(n):
        x = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        v[x] += 1
    cnt = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if v[i] >= 2:
            ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
        if v[i] >= 3:
            ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
        cnt += v[i]
    results.append(str(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is the sum of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` for all `i` where `v[i] >= 2`, plus the sum of `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` for all `i` where `v[i] >= 3`, `cnt` is equal to `n + 1`, `idx` is 3 + n, `i` is `n + 1`, and `results` contains a single string element which is the str representation of `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` contains a string representation of `ans` appended to it, `cnt` is increased by `v[i]` for each `i` in the range `[3, n + 1)`, and `ans` is updated according to the formulae provided in the loop body for each `i` in the same range.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n + 1`, `cnt` will be the sum of all elements in `v` (`sum(v)`), `ans` will be the sum of certain triangular and tetrahedral numbers based on the values in `v` that meet the criteria (specifically, for every `v[i] >= 3`, `ans` will include `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`, and for every `v[i] >= 2`, `ans` will include `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`), `n` remains unchanged, `results` will contain a single element which is the string representation of `ans`, and `idx`, `t`, and `results` remain in their initial states as they are not affected by the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
