Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is reduced by `2 * mi` and if `a[r]` is 0, `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 (or 0) and we break out of the nearest enclosing loop or block.**
