Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` will be 0, `lit` will remain as the list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` and `b` will be lists whose final states depend on the values of `lit` relative to `x` and `y` throughout the iterations. `cp` will remain 0. If `b` is not empty, `x` will be greater than `y`, otherwise `y` will be positive infinity. `x` will be equal to the last element of list `a` if `len(a) != 0`, otherwise `x` will be set to positive infinity. `b` will contain all elements of `lit` that satisfy the conditions specified within the loop. `s` is 0.**

This output state reflects that the variable `s` has been assigned the value 0 by the line `s = 0`. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
