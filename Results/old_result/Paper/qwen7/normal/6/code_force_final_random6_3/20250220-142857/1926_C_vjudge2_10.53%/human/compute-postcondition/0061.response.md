Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function does not return any value explicitly but implies processing or validation of these integers within its body.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over `t` test cases, and for each test case, it validates or processes the integer `n`. However, since the problem statement does not specify the exact operation, the focus here is on the parameters and their constraints.
