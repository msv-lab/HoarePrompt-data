Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `t` is given as an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive.
   - `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, meaning `n` will be an integer obtained from user input.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n + 1):` will execute if `n` is at least 1 (since the range function starts from 1).

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `t` is not directly involved in the loop condition, its value does not need to be adjusted.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

5. **Initial Value of `i`**:
   - The variable `i` starts at 1 because of the range function `range(1, n + 1)`. 

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` starts at 1.

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
