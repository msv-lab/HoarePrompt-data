Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `ans` is a list of n zeros, `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the first element of the `ans` list by adding 1 to the first element of the `arr` list. All other elements of `arr` and `t` remain unchanged, and `ans` is initialized with zeros except for the first element which is now `arr[0] + 1`.
