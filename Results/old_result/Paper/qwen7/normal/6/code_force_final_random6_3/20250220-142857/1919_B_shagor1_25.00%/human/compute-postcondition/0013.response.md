Output State: **`i` is the next character in the string `s`, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer, and `neg` is 3 if `i` is '-', otherwise `neg` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `neg += 1` increments the value of `neg` by 1. Since `neg` was initially 2 if `i` is '-' or 1 otherwise, incrementing it by 1 changes its value to 3 if `i` is '-' (making it 2+1) and to 2 if `i` is not '-' (making it 1+1). The values of `i`, `a`, `x`, and `neg` remain within their respective contexts, but `neg` is updated accordingly.
