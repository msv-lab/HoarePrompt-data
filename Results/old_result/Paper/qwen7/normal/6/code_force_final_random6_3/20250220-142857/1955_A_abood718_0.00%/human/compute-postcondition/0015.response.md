Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `A` is the first integer entered, `B` is the second integer entered, and `C` is the third integer entered. If `B * 2 < C`, then `A` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `A` is even, `B * 2 \geq C` still holds true and `A` remains unchanged. If `A` is odd, `B * 2 < C` holds true and `X` is set to `A // 2`.
