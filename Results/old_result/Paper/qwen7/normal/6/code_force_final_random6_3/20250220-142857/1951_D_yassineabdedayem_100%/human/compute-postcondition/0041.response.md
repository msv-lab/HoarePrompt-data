Output: **1**

Explanation: The initial state describes that `t` is an integer within the range of 1 to 998, `n` is the minimum of the original `n` and \(2 * k - 2\), and `k` is an integer read from standard input. The `print` statement simply outputs the integer 1, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`. Therefore, the output is **1**.
