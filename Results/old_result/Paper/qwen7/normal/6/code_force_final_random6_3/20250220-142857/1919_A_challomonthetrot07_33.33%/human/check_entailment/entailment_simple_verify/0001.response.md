### Reasoning:

1. **Test Cases Analysis**:
   - The program takes multiple test cases as input, each consisting of two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - The program then processes each test case individually, checking specific conditions to determine the winner.

2. **Conditions Checked**:
   - **Case 1**: `a == b` → Print 'Bob'
   - **Case 2**: `a == 1` → Print 'Alice'
   - **Case 3**: `b == 1` → Print 'Bob'
   - **Case 4**: `a % 2 == 1` → Print 'Bob'
   - **Case 5**: `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1` → Print 'Alice'
   - **Case 6**: `a > b` → Print 'Bob'
   - **Default Case**: Print 'Alice'

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The provided conditions do not fully capture the optimal strategy for the game. The key insight is that the player with an odd number of coins can always force the opponent into a losing position by swapping wallets and reducing the opponent's coins to an even number.
   - Conversely, the player with an even number of coins is at risk of being forced into a situation where they have an odd number of coins, which can lead to a loss.

4. **Verification**:
   - Let's analyze the conditions more closely:
     - **Case 1**: `a == b` → This condition is correct; if both players have the same number of coins, Bob wins because Alice cannot force a win.
     - **Case 2**: `a == 1` → This condition is correct; if Alice has 1 coin, she can force Bob into a losing position.
     - **Case 3**: `b == 1` → This condition is correct; if Bob has 1 coin, Alice can force Bob into a losing position.
     - **Case 4**: `a % 2 == 1` → This condition is incorrect; if Alice has an odd number of coins, she can always force Bob into a losing position, but the program incorrectly prints 'Bob'.
     - **Case 5**: `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1` → This condition is correct; if Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins, Alice can force Bob into a losing position.
     - **Case 6**: `a > b` → This condition is incorrect; if Alice has more coins than Bob, it does not necessarily mean Bob will lose. The correct condition should be `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`.
     - **Default Case**: `print('Alice')` → This default case is incorrect; it does not cover all scenarios correctly.

5. **Correct Conditions**:
   - The correct conditions should be:
     - If `a % 2 == 1` and `b % 2 == 0`, Alice wins.
     - If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`, Bob wins.
     - Other conditions should be handled accordingly.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game. The conditions provided do not accurately reflect the optimal strategy, leading to incorrect outputs in certain cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
