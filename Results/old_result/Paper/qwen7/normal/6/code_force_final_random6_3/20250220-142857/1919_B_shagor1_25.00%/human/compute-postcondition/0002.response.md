Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-', `neg` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `neg` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of these variables while adding the new variable `neg` with the value 0.
