Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. This means the loop variable is `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable), and the loop will run `t` times.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**: Since the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, it does not affect the state of the program. Therefore, we only need to consider the variables that are part of the loop's context and how they change with each iteration.

3. **Analyze the Given State**:
   - `index` is `13 + 2 * n`.
   - `PB` is an integer from `data[6]`.
   - `t` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`.
   - `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.
   - `k` is `int(data[4])`.
   - `PS` is an integer from `data[9]`.
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, data[index:index + n])`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `index` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify it.
   - `PB` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify it.
   - `t` is decremented by 1 after each iteration since the loop runs `t` times.
   - `results` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify it.
   - `k` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify it.
   - `PS` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify it.
   - `p` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify it.
   - `a` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify it.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `t` is reduced by 1 for the next iteration.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`index` is 13 + 2 * n, `PB` is an integer from `data[6]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `k` is `int(data[4])`, `PS` is an integer from `data[9]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, data[index:index + n])`**
