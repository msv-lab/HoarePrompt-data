Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, so `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each test case, `a` is the last input integer received, `s` is the last input string received, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, and `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`. The final printed value is `x + y - z`, which represents the net count of 'map' and 'pie' substrings in `s` excluding any overlapping 'mapie' substrings.
