Postcondition: `sz` is an integer, `sng` has had its first element printed 0 times, `ldb` remains unchanged from its initial state. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `sz` is less than `k`, the program continues without any changes to the variables.
