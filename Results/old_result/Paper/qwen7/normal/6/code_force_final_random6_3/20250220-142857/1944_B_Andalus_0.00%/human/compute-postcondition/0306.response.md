Output State: **`sng` remains the same, `sz` is equal to the previous value of `sz` + 1, `rdb` contains the elements that were printed up to the new value of `sz`, `lft` is a slice of `lst` containing the first `n` elements, and `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `lft = lst[:n]` creates a slice of the list `lst` starting from the beginning up to the index `n`. This slice is assigned to the variable `lft`. The values of `sng`, `sz`, `rdb`, and `lst` remain unchanged except that `sz` is incremented by 1 due to the slicing operation, which is consistent with the initial description.
