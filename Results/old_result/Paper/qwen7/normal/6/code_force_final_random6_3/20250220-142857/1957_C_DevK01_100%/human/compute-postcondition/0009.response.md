Output State: **`dp` is a list containing [28, 214], `i` is 7**

Explanation: The code `dp.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `dp`. Initially, `dp` contains `[6, 28, 214]`. After removing the first element (which is 6), `dp` becomes `[28, 214]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 7, and the condition that `n` must be at least 6 is still valid.
