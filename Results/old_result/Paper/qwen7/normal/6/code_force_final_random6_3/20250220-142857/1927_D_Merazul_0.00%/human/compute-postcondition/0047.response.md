Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be at least 3, `u` is False, `v` is False, `f` is False, `m` is `m - (False & ~False)` which simplifies to `m - 0` or just `m` since anything ANDed with False is False.**

In natural language: The value of `m` remains unchanged because `u` is False and `v` is False, making the expression `u & ~v` evaluate to False, which is 0 when used in arithmetic operations. All other variables retain their initial states.
