Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `steps` is 1; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is the first integer entered; `d` is the second integer entered; `e` is the first integer from the input split; `f` is the second integer from the input split; `g` is the first integer from the input split converted to an integer; `h` is the second integer from the input split converted to an integer; `n` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f); `x` is `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`**.

This means that the value of `x` is now the squared difference between `c` and `g` plus the squared difference between `d` and `h`. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated values.
