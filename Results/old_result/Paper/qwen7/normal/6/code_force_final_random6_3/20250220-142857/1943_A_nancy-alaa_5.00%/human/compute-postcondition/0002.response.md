Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to a string, splits the string into individual elements, converts those elements back to integers, and stores them in the list `arr`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
