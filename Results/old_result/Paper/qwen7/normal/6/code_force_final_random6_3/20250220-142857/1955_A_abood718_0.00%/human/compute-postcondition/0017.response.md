Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `A` is the first integer entered
   - `B` is the second integer entered
   - `C` is the third integer entered
   - If `B * 2 < C`, then `A` remains unchanged.
   - If `B * 2 \geq C`, then if `A` is even, `A` remains unchanged; if `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range of an integer input, which means the loop will run for each integer input provided.

3. **Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and the input values `A`, `B`, and `C`.

4. **Adjusting States**: We need to determine the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop. The key variables here are `i`, `A`, `B`, and `C`.

5. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will increment by 1. The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` will be updated based on the conditions provided.

6. **Conditions**:
   - If `B * 2 < C`, then `A` remains unchanged.
   - If `B * 2 \geq C`, then:
     - If `A` is even, `A` remains unchanged.
     - If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.

Given that the loop will take another input, let's denote the new inputs as `A'`, `B'`, and `C'`. The value of `i` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `A` will be replaced by `A'`.
- `B` will be replaced by `B'`.
- `C` will be replaced by `C'`.

Since we don't know the exact values of `A'`, `B'`, and `C'` from the problem statement, we can represent them as generic variables.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `A` is replaced by `A'`, `B` is replaced by `B'`, `C` is replaced by `C'`**
