Output State: **`i` is 2, `s` is the updated input string, `a` is the first integer from the split string representation of `s`, `b` is the second integer from the split string representation of `s`**.

Explanation: The code `s = input()` updates the variable `s` to the new input string provided by the user. The initial values of `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged until further operations are performed on them. Therefore, `i` remains 2, and `a` and `b` are yet to be determined based on the split of the new input string `s`.
