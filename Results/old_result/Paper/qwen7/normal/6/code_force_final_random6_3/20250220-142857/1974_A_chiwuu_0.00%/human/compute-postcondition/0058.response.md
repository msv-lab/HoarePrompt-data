Postcondition: `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word of the input split, `b` is the integer value of the second word of the input split, and `b` is now an integer. If `t % 5 == 0`, then `t` is set to `b * 2 // 5`; otherwise, `t` is set to `b * 2 + 1`.
