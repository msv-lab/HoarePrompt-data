Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `d`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop starts with `d = n - 1` and decrements `d` by 1 until `d` becomes -1. This means `d` will take values from `n-1` down to 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `d` is `n-2`
   - `v` is a vertex
   - `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`
   - `path` now contains all vertices added during the iterations plus the vertex `v`
   - The vertex `v` has been removed from `remaining_vertices`

4. **Determine the next value of `d`**: Since the loop decrements `d` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `d` will be `n-3`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `d` will be `n-3`
   - `v` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop body
   - `u` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop body
   - `path` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop body
   - `remaining_vertices` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop body (except for the removal of `v` which happened before the loop started)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`d` is `n-3`, `v` is a vertex, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` now contains all vertices added during the iterations plus the vertex `v`, and the vertex `v` has been removed from `remaining_vertices`**
