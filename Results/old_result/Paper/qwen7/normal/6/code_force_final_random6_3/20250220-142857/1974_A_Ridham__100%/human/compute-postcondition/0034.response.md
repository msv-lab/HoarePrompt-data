Postcondition: **`remaining_cells` is 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an integer from the input split, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `y` is either even or odd, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1, and `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether `y` is even or odd, `remaining_cells`, `t`, `result`, `x`, `space_x`, `total_space`, `y`, and `space_y` retain their respective properties as described in the precondition. The only difference is in the value of `screen_require_for_y`, which is set to `y // 2` if `y` is even, and `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd.
