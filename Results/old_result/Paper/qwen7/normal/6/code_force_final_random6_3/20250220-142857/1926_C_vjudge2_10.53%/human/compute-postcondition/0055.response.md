Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for n in numbers:`. This means the loop variable is `n`, and the iterable is `numbers`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the `numbers` list.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 45
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `numbers` must contain at least 10 integers
   - `i` is 21
   - `word` is '21'
   - `last` is 1
   - `remainder` is 2
   - `sum_total` is 6
   - `values[11]` is 2
   - `sum_values[11]` is 1
   - `sum_values[12]` is 3
   - `sum_values[13]` is 6
   - `values[21]` is 3
   - `sum_values[21]` is 6

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `numbers`, the only relevant state to adjust is the current value of `n` (the element being iterated over) and the state of the `numbers` list.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 21, and `n` is the current element being processed from the `numbers` list. For the loop to continue, `numbers` must still contain at least one element.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `n` is now the next element in the `numbers` list, and `numbers` must still contain at least 10 integers.

**State:**
- `total` is 45
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `numbers` must contain at least 10 integers
- `i` is 21
- `word` is '21'
- `last` is 1
- `remainder` is 2
- `sum_total` is 6
- `values[11]` is 2
- `sum_values[11]` is 1
- `sum_values[12]` is 3
- `sum_values[13] is 6
- `values[21]` is 3
- `sum_values[21]` is 6
- `n` is now the next element in the `numbers` list

However, since the exact value of `n` is not specified and it depends on the actual content of `numbers`, we can only state that `n` is the next element in the list.

**Final State:**
State: **`total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` must contain at least 10 integers, `i` is 21, `word` is '21', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 2, `sum_total` is 6, `values[11]` is 2, `sum_values[11]` is 1, `sum_values[12]` is 3, `sum_values[13]` is 6, `values[21]` is 3, `sum_values[21]` is 6, `n` is the next element in the `numbers` list**
