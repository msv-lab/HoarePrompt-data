Output State: **`t` must be an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 676, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be an integer within the range 1 to 676, and `i` remains 1. The values of `n` and `k` are now specific integers obtained from user input.
