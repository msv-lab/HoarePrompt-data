Postcondition: `win` is a set of integers, `us` is a set of integers (unchanged), `ans` is a list containing the elements `i`, `i`, `ps` is 3, `i` is the next element in `s`, `s` is the same set. If the element `i` is in `us`, then `ps` is set to 3. If the element `i` is not in `us`, then `ps` remains unchanged as 2.
