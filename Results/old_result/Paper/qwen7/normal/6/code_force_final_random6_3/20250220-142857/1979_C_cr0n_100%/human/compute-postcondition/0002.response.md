Output State: **`N` is an input integer, 1 ≤ N ≤ 50; `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers; `den` is the first element of the list `vals`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `vals` to the variable `den`. The values of `N` and `vals` remain unchanged.
