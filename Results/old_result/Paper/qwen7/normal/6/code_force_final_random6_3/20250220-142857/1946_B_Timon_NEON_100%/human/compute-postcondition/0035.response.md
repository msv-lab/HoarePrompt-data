Output State: **`segments_variants` is a list of segments, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the best segment found so far based on the sum comparison, and `max_sum` remains -1.**

Explanation: The code sets `new_segment` to an empty list. This changes the value of `new_segment` but does not affect the values of `segments_variants`, `max_segment`, or `max_sum`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `new_segment` and retains the previous states of the other variables.
