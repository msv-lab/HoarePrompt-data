Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range from 1 to \(n\), `l` is 0, `r` is \(n - 1\), `sunks` is 1, and the condition `a[l] * 2 - 1 != k` is true. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are modified and the only action is to exit the current block, the values of all variables remain as they were in the initial state, except that we know we have exited the loop or conditional block.
