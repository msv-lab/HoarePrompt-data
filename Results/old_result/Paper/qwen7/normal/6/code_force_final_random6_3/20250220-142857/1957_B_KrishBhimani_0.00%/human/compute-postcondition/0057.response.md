Output State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `c` is equal to the new input value + 2, `ans` is a list with elements as specified and extended by 0s to match the new length of `n`, `l1` is a list containing the split input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `l1 = input().split()` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns it to `l1`. The values of `arr`, `i`, `c`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
