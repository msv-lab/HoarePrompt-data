Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is `sz` + 1, which means `sz` is incremented by 1.
- `sng` must have at least one element, so `sng` is a non-empty list.
- `elem` is the first element of `sng`.

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the first element of the list `sng`.

Output: **elem (where elem is the first element of the list sng)**
