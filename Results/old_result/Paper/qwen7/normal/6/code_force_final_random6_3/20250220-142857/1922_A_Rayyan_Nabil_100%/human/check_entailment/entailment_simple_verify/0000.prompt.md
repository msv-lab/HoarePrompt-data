You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to `n`. During these iterations, the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` was never met for any `i` from `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, the function does not return 'YES' during the loop's execution. As a result, the function continues until the loop completes without returning 'YES', implying that for every `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, at least one of the following holds true: `a[i] == c[i]` or `b[i] == c[i]`.
    #
    #The final output state is that the function has completed all its iterations without returning 'YES', and for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the condition `a[i] == c[i]` or `b[i] == c[i]` is satisfied.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO', indicating that for every index i from 0 to n-1, the condition a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i] is satisfied, and the function did not return 'YES' during its execution.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, a, b, and c are strings of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be equal to 0, `n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the final input string stripped of leading trailing whitespace, `c` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration from 1 to `t`, `_` is `t`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0 because it decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the last inputs provided during the loop's execution. The `results` list will contain the outputs of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each of the `t` iterations.
    for result in results:
        print(result)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a template that matches both `a` and `b` but not `c`. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if there is at least one position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]`, but this is not sufficient to determine the existence of a valid template.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  2
  3
  abb
  abb
  abb
  3
  aab
  aab
  aab
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  NO
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  YES
  YES
  ```

In the first test case, both `a` and `b` are `"abb"`, and `c` is also `"abb"`. The function `func_1` will return `'YES'` because `a[i]` and `b[i]` match `c[i]` for all positions `i`. However, there is no template that would make `a` and `b` match while making `c` not match, since `a`, `b`, and `c` are identical.

In the second test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are all `"aab"`. Again, the function `func_1` will return `'YES'` because `a[i]` and `b[i]` match `c[i]` for all positions `i`. There is no template that would make `a` and `b` match while making `c` not match, since `a`, `b`, and `c` are identical.

The function `func_1` does not account for the constraints that the template must allow `a` and `b` to match but disallow `c`. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the required logic, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.
