Output State: **`flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `0`, `cnt` is `1`**.

The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Given that `cnt` was initially `0`, after executing this line, `cnt` becomes `1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
