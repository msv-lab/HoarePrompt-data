Postcondition: **`arr` is [0], `i` is 0, `c` is equal to the new input value + 2, `ans` is a list with elements as specified and extended by 0s to match the new length of `n`, `n` is an integer obtained from splitting the last element of `l1` and converting it to an integer, `k` is a non-zero odd number, `k0` is equal to `k`**.

This postcondition indicates that after the execution of the if-else block, the list `arr` remains unchanged as [0], the index `i` stays at 0, the value of `c` is the new input value plus 2, the list `ans` is extended by zeros to match the new length `n`, `n` is derived from the last element of `l1` converted to an integer, and `k` is confirmed to be a non-zero odd number with `k0` being equal to `k`.
