Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `i` is 21, `word` is '21', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 2, `sum_total` is 6, `values[11]` is 2, `sum_values[11]` is 1, `sum_values[12]` is 3, `sum_values[13]` is 6, `values[21]` is 3, `sum_values[21]` is 6.

Explanation: After the loop completes all 10 iterations, the variable `i` will be 21 because it starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time through the loop. The `word` variable will hold the string representation of `i`, which is '21'. The `last` variable will be the last digit of `i`, which is 1, and `remainder` will be the integer formed by the remaining digits, which is 2. The `sum_total` will be the sum of `values[i]` and `sum_values[i-1]`, which is 3 + 3 = 6. The `values` list will have the value 3 at index 21, and the `sum_values` list will have the cumulative sums from 0 to 6 at indices 11 to 21.
Code of the loop:
for n in numbers:
    print(sum_values[n])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` must contain at least 10 integers, `i` is 21, `word` is '21', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 2, `sum_total` is 6, `values[11]` is 2, `sum_values[11]` is 1, `sum_values[12]` is 3, `sum_values[13]` is 6, `values[21]` is 3, `sum_values[21]` is 6

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: State:

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `numbers` must be a list with at least one more element




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
