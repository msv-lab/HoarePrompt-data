Postcondition: `aa` must have at least `n` elements, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` each have at least 1 element. `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, so `D[in_aa]` is now `D[in_aa] + 1`. Either `C[in_aa]` is equal to `D[in_aa]` and `E[out_aa]` is either less than its original value or less than or equal to 0, or `C[in_aa]` is not equal to `D[in_aa]`.
