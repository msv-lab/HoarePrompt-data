Output State: **`input_value` is an integer, `word` is an empty string, `i` is `input_value` + 1, `n` is `input_value`**

The code sets `word` to an empty string, which changes its value from a string based on `input_value` to an empty string. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the assignment to `word`.
