Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 998\), `n` is the minimum of the original `n` and \(2 * k - 2\), and `k` is an integer read from standard input. If `n + 2 > k * 2`, the condition holds as is. Otherwise, the condition also holds as the else part does not change the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.**
