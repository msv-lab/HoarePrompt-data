Reasoning:
1. The program should handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.
2. For each test case, the program should correctly identify whether the array is monotonically the same (all elements are identical).
3. If the array is monotonically the same, the program should output `-1` as it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.
4. If the array is not monotonically the same, the program should calculate the minimum number of consecutive identical elements and output the smallest such count. This count represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

However, there are several issues with the current implementation:
- The function `func_1()` does not properly handle the logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove.
- The variable `flag` is not used effectively to determine the minimum count of consecutive identical elements.
- The logic for calculating the minimum count of consecutive identical elements is flawed and does not correctly reflect the problem requirements.

Given these issues, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
