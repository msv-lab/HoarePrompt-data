Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to find the area of a square by calculating the squared distance between pairs of points and determining the minimum distance. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly identify the side length of the square. The program compares the squared distances between different pairs of points, which does not necessarily give the side length of the square.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the side length of the square. Given that the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by finding the maximum difference in either the x-coordinates or the y-coordinates among the four points.

Hereâ€™s how the program should work:

1. Read the coordinates of the four points.
2. Calculate the differences in x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
3. Determine the maximum difference in x-coordinates and the maximum difference in y-coordinates.
4. The side length of the square is the maximum of these two differences.
5. Compute the area of the square as the side length squared.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
