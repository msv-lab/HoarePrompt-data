Output: **YES**

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `s` is an empty string.
- Since `s` is an empty string, there are no characters in it.
- Therefore, the set `a`, which contains all unique characters from the original string `s`, is also an empty set.
- The length of set `a` is greater than 1, but since `a` is empty, this condition does not affect the print statement.
- The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.
