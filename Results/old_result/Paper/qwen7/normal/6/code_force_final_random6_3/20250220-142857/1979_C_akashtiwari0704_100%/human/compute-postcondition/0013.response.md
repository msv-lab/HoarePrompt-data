Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `T` remains 0, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `g` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `bets = int(input())` takes an input and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `bets`. The other variables (`T`, `n`, `k`, `g`, `i`, `l`) are not affected by this operation and retain their previous states.
