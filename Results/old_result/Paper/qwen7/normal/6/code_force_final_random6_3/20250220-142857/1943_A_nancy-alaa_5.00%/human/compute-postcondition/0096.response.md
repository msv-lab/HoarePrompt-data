Output State: **`first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer equal to `n`, `n` is an integer equal to the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `arr`. The variables `first`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
