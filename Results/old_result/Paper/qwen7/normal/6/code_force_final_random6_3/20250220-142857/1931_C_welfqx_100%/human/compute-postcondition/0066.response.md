Output State: **`ii` is 2, `n` is a value such that the loop runs `n - 1` times and `n > 3`, `cn` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, and `num` is a list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not affect the values of the variables `ii`, `n`, `cn`, or `num`. It only indicates that the execution exits the loop or conditional block it was inside.
