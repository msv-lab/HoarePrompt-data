Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(1, b + 1)`. This means `i` will take values from 1 to `b` (inclusive).

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` being 1, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 1 at the start of the loop.

3. **Determine the value of `b`**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b`. Therefore, `b` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `i` is 1 and `b` is a positive integer. The other variables (`t`, `info`, `a`, `suma`) do not affect the loop's execution and can remain as they are.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 1.
- `b` must be a positive integer.

Therefore, the final state is:

**`t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `a` is an integer equal to the first element of `info`, `b` must be a positive integer, `suma` is 0, `i` is 1**.

So, the answer is:

State: **`t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `a` is an integer equal to the first element of `info`, `b` must be a positive integer, `suma` is 0, `i` is 1**
