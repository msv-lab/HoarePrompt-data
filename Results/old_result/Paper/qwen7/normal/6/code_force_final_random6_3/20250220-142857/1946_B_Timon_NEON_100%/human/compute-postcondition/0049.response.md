Output State: **`segments_variants` now includes `new_segment + [i - 1]`, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`, and `i` is set to `i_end + 1`.**

Explanation: The code sets `max_segment` to the value of `new_segment`. The other variables (`segments_variants` and `i`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
