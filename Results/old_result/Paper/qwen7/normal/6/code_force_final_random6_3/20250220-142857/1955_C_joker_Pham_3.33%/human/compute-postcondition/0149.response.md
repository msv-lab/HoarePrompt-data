Output State: **`l` is incremented by 1; `k` is adjusted to `k - a[r] * 2`; `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`; `sunks` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[l] -= a[r]` subtracts the value of `a[r]` from `a[l]`. Given the initial conditions, `l` is incremented by 1, `k` is adjusted to `k - a[r] * 2`, and `sunks` is increased by 1. The value of `r` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated states of the variables are as described.
