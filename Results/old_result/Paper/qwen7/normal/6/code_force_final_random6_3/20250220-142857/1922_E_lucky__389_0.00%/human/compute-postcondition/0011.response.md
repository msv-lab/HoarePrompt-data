Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `mx` is 0.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `x` is an input integer - 1 and `x` must not be 0.
   - `subseq_lens` is an empty list.
   - `i` is 3.

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

4. **Check the Current Value of `i`**: Currently, `i` is 3.

5. **Evaluate the Loop Condition with Current Values**:
   - Substitute `i = 3` into the loop condition: \(2^{(3 + 1)} \leq x + 1\).
   - This simplifies to \(2^4 \leq x + 1\), which means \(16 \leq x + 1\) or \(x \geq 15\).

6. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition \(2^{(i + 1)} \leq x + 1\) must hold true.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, we need to increment `i` to 4 for the next iteration.
   - We need to ensure that the condition \(2^{(4 + 1)} \leq x + 1\) holds true, which means \(x \geq 15\).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to 4.
- `x` must be at least 15 to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` must be at least 15, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `i` is 4**
