Output State: **`path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` must not be empty, `d` is `n-1`, `v` is 0, we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `path`, `remaining_vertices`, `d`, `v`, and `u` within the scope of the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged. The `u` variable, which was previously set to the value returned by `func_1(d)`, is not altered by the `continue` statement. Therefore, the only impact is that the loop continues to the next iteration.
