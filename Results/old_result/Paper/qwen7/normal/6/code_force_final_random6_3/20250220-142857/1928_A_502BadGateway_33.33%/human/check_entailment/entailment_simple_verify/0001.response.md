### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` should return `'Yes'` or `'No'` instead of `'yes'` or `'no'`. However, the assessment does not fully address the core logic and the overall correctness of the program. Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the dimensions `a` and `b` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` is defined to check if Bob can form another rectangle.
   - The logic in `func_1` checks if `b % 2 == 0`. If `b` is even, it returns `'Yes'`, otherwise `'No'`.

3. **Problem Description**:
   - According to the problem, Bob can form another rectangle if he can cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   - The key insight here is that if `b` is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and rearrange them to form a new rectangle. For example:
     - A \(2 \times 6\) rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and rearranged to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle.
     - A \(2 \times 4\) rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles and rearranged to form a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle.
   - If `b` is odd, Bob cannot form another rectangle because cutting the rectangle into two smaller rectangles will result in at least one dimension being odd, and no further rearrangement will yield a different rectangle.

4. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly implements the logic to check if `b` is even.
   - The function returns `'Yes'` if `b % 2 == 0` and `'No'` otherwise, which matches the required format.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` is correctly implemented and the program correctly handles the input and outputs the expected results. The original assessment correctly identified the need to return `'Yes'` and `'No'` instead of `'yes'` and `'no'`, but the core logic and the overall correctness of the program are indeed correct.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided annotations.
