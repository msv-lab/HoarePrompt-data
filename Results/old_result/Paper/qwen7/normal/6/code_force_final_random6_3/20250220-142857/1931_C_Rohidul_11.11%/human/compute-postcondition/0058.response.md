Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `l` is 4.
   - `r` is greater than 3.
   - `st` is 3.
   - `end` is increased by 1.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute again, both conditions `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must be true.
   - `l` is fixed at 4, so `r` must be greater than 4 for the first part of the condition (`r > l`) to be true.
   - The second part of the condition, `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, depends on the values of `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]`, but since we don't have information about the array `a`, we focus on the variables `l` and `r`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `l` is fixed at 4, `r` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.
   - The values of `st` and `end` do not affect the loop condition directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `r` to be greater than 4.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`l` is 4, `r` must be greater than 4, `st` is 3, `end` is increased by 1**
