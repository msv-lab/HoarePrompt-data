Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

The print statement simply outputs the number `1`. Since no specific values for `n` and `m` are given, the value of `k` is irrelevant to the output of the print statement.

Output: **1**
