Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5, k is a positive integer not exceeding 10^15, and nums is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()

        if b > 0:

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is 0, `nums` is an empty deque, `ans` is the total number of times `b` was found to be non-positive during the loop's execution.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues as long as `k` is non-zero and there are at least 2 elements in `nums`. Each iteration reduces `k` by a value depending on the minimum of the first and last elements of `nums`, and updates `nums` accordingly. Once `k` becomes zero or `nums` has less than 2 elements, the loop terminates. The variable `ans` keeps track of how many times `b` (the last element of `nums` before it is possibly appended back) was found to be non-positive, which happens when `b` is reduced to 0 or less during the loop's execution. Since the loop ends when `k` is 0 or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements, `k` will be 0 and `nums` will be an empty deque by the end of all iterations.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns the total number of times `b` was found to be non-positive during the loop's execution plus 1.
    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is 0, `nums` is an empty deque, and the length of `nums` is at least 2
    return ans
    #The program returns ans, which is currently 0 since no operations have been performed to change its value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\)), and `nums` (a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive). It processes the list `nums` by repeatedly removing the first and last elements, reducing `k` based on their minimum value, and updating the count of times the last element (`b`) was found to be non-positive. If `k` becomes zero or there are fewer than two elements left in `nums`, the function returns the count of non-positive `b` values plus one. If no operations were performed, it returns zero.
