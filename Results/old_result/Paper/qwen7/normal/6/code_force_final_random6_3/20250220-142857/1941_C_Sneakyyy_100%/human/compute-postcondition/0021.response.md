Output State: **`a` is unchanged, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and of length 3.**

Explanation: The code `s = a[i:i + 3]` slices the list `a` starting from index `i` and extracts a substring of length 3. The original list `a` remains unchanged, and the new variable `s` holds the substring of `a`. The exact values of the elements in `s` depend on the values in `a` starting from index `i`.
