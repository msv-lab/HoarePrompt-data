Output State: **`ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`, `i` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, and the current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2.**

This means that the variable `ans` has been updated by adding the value of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` to its current value. The variable `i` remains 0, `n` stays unchanged, and the condition that the current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2 is still valid.
