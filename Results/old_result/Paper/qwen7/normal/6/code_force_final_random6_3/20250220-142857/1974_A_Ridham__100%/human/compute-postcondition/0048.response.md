The code sets `screen_require_for_y` to `y // 2`. Given that `screen_require_for_y` was previously either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1`, setting it to `y // 2` means that `screen_require_for_y` is now definitively `y // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_cells` is `15 * (screen_require_for_y - space_y)`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or `screen_require_for_y + extra_screen`, `x` is updated to the first integer from the input split, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + x`, `y` is either even or odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`, and `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.**
