Output State: **`cur_arr` must contain at least one element; `xor` is now 0; `new_arr` contains the previous elements plus 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `xor` to 0, which changes its value from its previous state (being equal to `xor ^ i`). Since `new_arr` was previously defined as containing the previous elements plus `xor`, setting `xor` to 0 means that `new_arr` now contains the previous elements plus 0, which does not change the contents of `new_arr`. The precondition that `cur_arr` must contain at least one element remains unchanged.
