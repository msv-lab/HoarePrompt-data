Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 998\), `n` is an integer equal to the minimum of `n` and `2 * k - 2`, and `k` is an integer read from standard input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. It does not change the value of `t` directly but decrements `t` by 1 only if `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is less than or equal to `2 * k`. If these conditions are met, `n` is set to the value of `2 * k - 2` (ensuring `n + 2` is less than or equal to `2 * k`). The value of `t` is thus decremented by 1 under these conditions.
