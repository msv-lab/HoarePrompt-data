Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `q`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `q` is an input integer.
3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `q` is greater than or equal to 1. If `q` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.
4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing, which means `q` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `q` and `i`. Since `i` starts from 0 in the `range(q)` function, we can directly state the necessary conditions for the loop to start executing.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `q` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
