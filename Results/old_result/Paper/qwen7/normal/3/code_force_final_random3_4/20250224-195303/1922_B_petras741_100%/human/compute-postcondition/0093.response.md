Based on the initial state provided:

- `eta_ln` is 1, which indicates that `q[j] > 0` for at least one `j` in the range from 0 to `n` inclusive.
- `rho` is assigned the value of `q[eta[0]]`. Since `eta[0]` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `rho` without more information. However, this value is not needed to evaluate the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
```

This statement calculates the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), which represents the number of ways to choose 3 items from `n` items. The expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` computes this value by dividing the product of `n`, `(n - 1)`, and `(n - 2)` by 6.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can only express the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6**
