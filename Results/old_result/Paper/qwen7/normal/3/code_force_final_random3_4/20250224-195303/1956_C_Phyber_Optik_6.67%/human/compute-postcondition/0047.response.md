Output: **1 2 3 ... n**

Explanation: 
- `j` is explicitly given as 3, but it does not affect the output of the `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement.
- `n` is a positive integer, but its exact value is not specified. Therefore, we represent it as `n`.
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
- The `*` operator before `range(1, n + 1)` in the `print` function unpacks the range object into separate arguments for the `print` function, which then prints them out separated by spaces.

Thus, the output will be a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`, separated by spaces.
