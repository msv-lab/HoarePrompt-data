Output State: **`results` is a list containing `count`, `count` is the sum of all values obtained by `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each `num` in `arr`, `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(r_x, r_y)` and the value is the count of how many times that specific tuple has been encountered, `r_x` is `-num % x` for each `num` in `arr`, `r_y` is `num % y` for each `num` in `arr`, `current_key` is updated to `(num % x, num % y)` for each `num` in `arr`, and `num` is the last element processed in `arr` after all iterations of the loop.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` to the list `results`. This does not change the value of `count` itself, nor does it affect any other variables. The `residue_map`, `r_x`, `r_y`, `current_key`, and `num` remain unchanged from their previous states. The only new information is that `results` now contains `count`.
