Output State: **`a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `tmp` is a list containing the element ((a[2] - a[1]) // 2)**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression evaluates to `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`. This value is then appended to `tmp`. The initial state of `a` and `i` remains unchanged, but `tmp` now contains the calculated value.
