Let's break down the given code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - The `trumps` list is sorted in descending order and must not be empty.
   - This means `trumps` contains at least one element, and the elements are in descending order.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - `trumps.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the `trumps` list.
   - Since `trumps` is sorted in descending order, the last element is the smallest element in the list.
   - After removing the last element, `trumps.pop()` again removes and returns the new last element of the updated `trumps` list.
   - The `trump` variable is mentioned but not defined in the initial state, so it remains as `trump`.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - Let's assume the initial `trumps` list is `[T1, T2, T3]` where `T1 > T2 > T3`.
   - After the first `pop`, `T3` is removed and returned.
   - After the second `pop`, `T2` is removed and returned.
   - Therefore, the output will be `T3trump T2trump`.

Based on this reasoning, the output will be:

Output: **T3trump T2trump**
