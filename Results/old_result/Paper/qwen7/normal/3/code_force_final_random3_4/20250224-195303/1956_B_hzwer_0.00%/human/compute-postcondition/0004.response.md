Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1), initialized with 0's; `dp[n-1][0]` is 0; `dp[n-2][0]` is 0.**

The code sets the value of `dp[n-2][0]` to 0. Since `dp` was initially a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) filled with 0's and `dp[n-1][0]` was already 0, the only change is that `dp[n-2][0]` is now also set to 0.
