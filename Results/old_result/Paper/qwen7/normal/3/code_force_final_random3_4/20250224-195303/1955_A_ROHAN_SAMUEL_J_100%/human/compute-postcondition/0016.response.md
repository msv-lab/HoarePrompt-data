Postcondition: `n` is an integer input from the user, `a` is an integer input from the user, `b` is an integer input from the user. If `n` is odd, the condition remains unchanged whether `2 * a` is less than `b` or not. If `n` is even, the condition also remains unchanged whether `2 * a` is less than `b` or not.
