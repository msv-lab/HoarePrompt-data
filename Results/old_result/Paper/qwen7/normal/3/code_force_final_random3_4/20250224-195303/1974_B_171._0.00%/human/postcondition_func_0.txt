The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It maps each character in `encoded` to another character based on a predefined mapping. If a character is not already mapped, it is mapped to the next available character from 'a' to 'z'. After processing all characters in `encoded`, it constructs and returns a new string where each character in `encoded` has been replaced according to the mapping. If `encoded` is an empty string, it simply returns an empty string.
