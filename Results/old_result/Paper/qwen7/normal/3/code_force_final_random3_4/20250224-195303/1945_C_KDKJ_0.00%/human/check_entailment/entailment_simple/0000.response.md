### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The problem requires determining the optimal position `i` for placing a road that divides the village into left and right sides, ensuring at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
   - The satisfaction condition is met if the number of residents wanting to live on the left side is at least \(\lceil \frac{\text{left side count}}{2} \rceil\) and similarly for the right side.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1()`**:
     - **Input**: `n` (number of houses) and `a` (a string representing the preferences of the residents).
     - **Process**:
       - A list `S` is initialized to store cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each house.
       - For each character in `a`, update the counts in `S`.
       - Iterate through each position `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
         - Calculate the number of '0's (`left`) and '1's (`right`) on the left and right sides of the proposed road.
         - Check if the conditions for satisfaction are met:
           - \(2 \times \text{left} \geq \text{left side count}\)
           - \(2 \times \text{right} \geq \text{right side count}\)
         - If both conditions are met, update `ans` if the current `i` is closer to the center of the village (\(\left| \frac{n}{2} - i \right|\)).

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The code correctly initializes and updates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's.
   - It iterates through each possible position `i` and checks the satisfaction conditions.
   - The logic for updating `ans` ensures that the position `i` is chosen to be as close to the center of the village as possible while meeting the satisfaction criteria.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where the conditions might not be met for any `i` by continuing to the next iteration without updating `ans`.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The function prints the optimal position `i` that meets the criteria.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It accurately calculates the optimal position for the road based on the given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
