Output State: **`h1` is '03', `m1` is the string converted from the second input split by `:`, `time` is 'PM', and `h` is '15'.**

Explanation: The code assigns the string 'PM' to the variable `time`. None of the other variables (`h1`, `m1`, or `h`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.
