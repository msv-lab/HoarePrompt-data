Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The program attempts to find the minimum length of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar` and prints this value if it exists, or `-1` if no such sequence exists. However, this approach does not address the requirement to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements. Instead, it focuses on finding the shortest sequence of identical elements, which is not equivalent to determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
1. Identify the longest sequence of identical elements.
2. Calculate the total number of elements that need to be removed to break this sequence.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:
- The logic to find the minimum length of consecutive occurrences of any element does not account for the requirement to break the array's beauty by removals.
- The program does not consider the possibility of breaking the sequence by removing elements strategically to ensure the array cannot become beautiful anymore.

Therefore, the given program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem.

Correctness: **False**
