Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new string input from the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`, `z` is an empty string**.

Explanation: The code `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` reverses the string `arr` using slicing (`arr[::-1]`) and then finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string. This index is stored in `y`. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, and `z` remain unchanged.
