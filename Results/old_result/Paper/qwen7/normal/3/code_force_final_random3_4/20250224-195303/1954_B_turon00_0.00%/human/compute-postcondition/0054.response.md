Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the postcondition from the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `ans` is updated based on the condition where `a[i]` equals `tmp`.
   - `cnt` is reset to 0.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (greater than 0).
   - `ans` and `cnt` are not directly affected by the loop head, so their values remain unchanged until the loop body is executed.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` needs to be incremented by 1 from 0 to 1.
   - `n` remains the same and must still be greater than 0.
   - `ans` and `cnt` are not adjusted here as they are part of the loop body logic.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
