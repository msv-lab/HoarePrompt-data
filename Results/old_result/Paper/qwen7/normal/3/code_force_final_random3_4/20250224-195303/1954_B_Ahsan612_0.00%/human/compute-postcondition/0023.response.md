Output State: **`same` is either 1 or 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list `ar` and is now the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `num` is equal to `ar[i]`.**

This means that the value of `minn` has been updated to be the minimum between its current value and `same`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
