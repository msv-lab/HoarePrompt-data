Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is 2, `done` is set to True, and `count2` is 0.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the variables `j`, `n`, `done`, and `count2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
