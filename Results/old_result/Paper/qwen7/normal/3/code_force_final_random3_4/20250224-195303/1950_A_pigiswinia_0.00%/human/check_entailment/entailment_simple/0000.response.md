Reasoning:

1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates through each test case, reading three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case.
3. The conditions for checking whether the digits form a stair or a peak are correctly implemented:
   - `if a < b < c:` checks for a stair.
   - `elif a < b > c:` checks for a peak.
4. The `else` block handles the case where neither condition is met, printing "NONE".
5. The output format matches the requirements of the problem statement.

Given the above points, the provided code appears to be correct and should produce the expected output based on the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
