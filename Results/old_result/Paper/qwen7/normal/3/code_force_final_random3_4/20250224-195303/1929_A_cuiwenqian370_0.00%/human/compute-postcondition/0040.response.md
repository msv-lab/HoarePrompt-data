Output State: The value of `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between every consecutive pair of elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to `n-1`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`), `max_beauty` will hold the total sum of the absolute differences between each adjacent pair of elements in the `new_arr` list.
