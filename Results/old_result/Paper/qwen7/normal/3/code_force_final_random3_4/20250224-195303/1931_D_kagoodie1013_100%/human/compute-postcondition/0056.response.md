Output State: **`count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`, `arr` must contain at least one element, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the tuple `num % x, num % y` to the variable `current_key`. This does not affect the values of `count`, `arr`, `r_x`, or `r_y`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states.
