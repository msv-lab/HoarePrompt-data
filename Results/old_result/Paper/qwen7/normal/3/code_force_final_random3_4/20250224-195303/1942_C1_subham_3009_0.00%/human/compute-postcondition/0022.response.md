Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, it receives n, x, and y as positive integers (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), y = 0). Additionally, it receives a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. The function returns a result based on the given inputs for each test case.**
