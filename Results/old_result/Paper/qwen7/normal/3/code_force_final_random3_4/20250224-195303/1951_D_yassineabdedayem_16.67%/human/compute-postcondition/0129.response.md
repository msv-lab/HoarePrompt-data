Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` must be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `k` is `k - min(n // k, k)**.

Explanation: The code `k = k - Min` updates the value of `k` to be `k - min(n // k, k)`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
