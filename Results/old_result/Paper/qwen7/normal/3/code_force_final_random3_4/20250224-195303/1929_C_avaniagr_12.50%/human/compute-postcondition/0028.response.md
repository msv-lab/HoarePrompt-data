Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(x + 1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 1
   - `x` must be a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
   - `z` is 2 * (`z // (k - 1) + 1`) (Note: This variable `z` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.)

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `x + 1`.

4. **Update the state**: Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2. Therefore, `i` becomes 2.

5. **Adjust `x`**: The value of `x` remains unchanged because the loop condition depends on `i` being less than `x + 1`. Since `i` is now 2, `x` must still be a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) such that `2 <= x + 1`.

6. **Final state**: The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 2, `x` must be a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)**
