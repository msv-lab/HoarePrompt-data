Postcondition: `wins` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element from the input split into an integer, `i` is 0, and if `a[i] > a[k - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
