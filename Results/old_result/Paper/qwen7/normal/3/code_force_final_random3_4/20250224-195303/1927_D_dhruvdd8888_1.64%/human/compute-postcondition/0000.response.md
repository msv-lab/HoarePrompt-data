Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is in the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n; `input` is set to `sys.stdin.readline`**.

The code simply reassigns the `input` function to `sys.stdin.readline`, which changes how input is read from the standard input. However, the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `q` remain unchanged, as well as the structure of the queries.
