Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `wins` is 1
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\)
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element from the input split into an integer
   - `i` is 0

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, after the loop increments `i` by 1, `i` will become 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`. Since `i` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 1 (which it already is, as per the given constraints).

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`wins` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element from the input split into an integer, `i` is 1**
