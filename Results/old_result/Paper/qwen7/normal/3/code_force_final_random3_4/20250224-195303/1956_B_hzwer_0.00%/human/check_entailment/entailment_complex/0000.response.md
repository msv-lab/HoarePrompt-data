Reasoning:

The provided program aims to calculate the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally, given the constraints of the game and the cards in your hand. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The dynamic programming table `dp` is initialized correctly to store the maximum points achievable for different states.
3. **DP Table Filling**: The nested loops fill the DP table according to the rules of the game:
   - If a card with a specific number `j+1` is not present in the hand, the current state remains the same as the next state.
   - If a card with a specific number `j+1` is present once, the decision is made based on whether to use this card now or save it for later.
   - If a card with a specific number `j+1` is present twice, the decision is made similarly but considering the possibility of using one card now and the other later.
4. **Result Calculation**: The result is obtained from `dp[0][0]`, which represents the maximum points achievable starting from the initial state.

Given the problem statement and the provided code, the logic implemented in the function `func_1()` aligns with the requirements. The dynamic programming approach correctly models the game's rules and computes the optimal strategy for maximizing your points while minimizing Nene's points.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
