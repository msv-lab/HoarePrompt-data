Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \), followed by a list of \( n \) non-negative integers. It then constructs a string \( ans \) by converting each integer in the list to a corresponding character based on the value of the integer plus 97, and increments a separate list \( s \) by the count of each integer in the list. After processing all test cases, it prints the constructed string \( ans \) for each case. The final state includes the printed strings for all test cases.**
