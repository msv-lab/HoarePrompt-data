Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - A function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is an issue because the function should be called to process each test case.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - Inside the loop, it calls `func_1()`, which is incorrect because `func_1()` does not take any arguments and is not defined to handle the input directly.

4. **Function Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1()`:
     - Takes `x` and `n` as inputs.
     - Initializes `ans` to 0.
     - Iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `x`.
     - Checks if `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - If `i` is a divisor, it checks two conditions:
       - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
       - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
     - Prints the final value of `ans`.

5. **Logic and Output:**
   - The logic in `func_1()` is correct for finding the maximum balance.
   - However, since `func_1()` is not being called within the main loop, the program will not process any test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not call the function `func_1()` to process the test cases. The function `func_1()` is defined but never used in the main loop.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from math import isqrt

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
