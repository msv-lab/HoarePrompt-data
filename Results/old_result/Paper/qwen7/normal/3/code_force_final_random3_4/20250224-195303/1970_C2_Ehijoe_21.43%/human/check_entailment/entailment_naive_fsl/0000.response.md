Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the `func_1` function is calculating the distances from the starting node to all other nodes, but it does not simulate the game moves or determine the winner based on optimal play. 

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the game rounds and determine the winner based on the parity of the distance from the starting node to its neighbors. The current implementation does not account for the alternating moves between Ron and Hermione and does not check if a player can always make a move based on the structure of the tree.

For example, consider a simple tree with 4 nodes (1, 2, 3, 4) where node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3, and node 2 is connected to node 4. If the game starts at node 1, Ron can move to either node 2 or node 3. If Hermione moves to node 4, Ron will lose because he cannot move from node 4 back to an unvisited node. However, the current program does not simulate these moves and determine the winner based on the optimal strategy.
