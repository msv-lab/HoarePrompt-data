Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes `ans` to `x + y - 2`, which accounts for the initial triangles formed by the chosen vertices.
2. It checks for consecutive vertices that are exactly 2 units apart, which allows forming additional triangles without needing extra vertices.
3. It handles the edge case of the first and last chosen vertices being 2 units apart by adding half the distance minus one to `ans`.
4. The program sorts the list `tmp` which contains the number of additional triangles that can be formed by choosing vertices at even intervals.
5. It iterates through `tmp` and adds the number of triangles that can be formed using the available `y` vertices, decrementing `y` accordingly.
6. Finally, it ensures that the answer does not exceed `n - 2` by taking the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2`.

Given the explanation and the steps involved, the program appears to follow the logic required to solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **True**
