Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop variable `j` is defined in the range `start_index, start_index + i + 1`.

2. **Determine the current state**:
   - `j` is currently `i + 1`.
   - `arr[j]` is assigned the value `i`.
   - `start_index + i + 1` remains unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs from `start_index` to `start_index + i + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `i + 1`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `start_index + i + 1`.
   - Since `j` starts at `i + 1` and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `i + 2`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be `i + 2`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` should be `i + 2`.
   - `arr[j]` will be assigned the value `i` in the next iteration.
   - `start_index + i + 1` remains unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`j` is `i + 2`, `arr[j]` is assigned the value `i`, `start_index + i + 1` remains unchanged**
