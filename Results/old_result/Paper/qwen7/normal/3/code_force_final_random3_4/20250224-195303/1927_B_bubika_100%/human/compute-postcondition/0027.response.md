Output State: **`i` is the first character of the string `s`; `x` is the index of `i` in the string `b`.**

Explanation: The code `x = b.index(i)` finds the index of the character `i` in the string `b` and assigns it to the variable `x`. The initial state of `i` being the first character of the string `s` and `s` being a non-empty string remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes these conditions along with the new assignment for `x`.
