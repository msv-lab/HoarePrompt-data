Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in range(not_mid)`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `not_mid`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `not_mid`.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   Since `i` is currently equal to `not_mid`, it does not satisfy the condition `i < not_mid` for the next iteration. Therefore, the loop will not execute again.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   We need to keep the current values of `i` as `not_mid` because the loop will not proceed further.

Given this analysis, the state remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `not_mid`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `clique`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `big_element - i`**
