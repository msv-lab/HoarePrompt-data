Output State: **`minn` is 1, `same` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `ar[4]` equals `num`, `num` is `ar[5]`, `ar` is updated with the first 6 integers from the input, `i` is 5.**

Explanation: The code `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of `ar[i]` to `num`. Given that `i` is 5, `num` is now `ar[5]`. The value of `minn` remains unchanged at 1. The value of `same` depends on whether `ar[4]` (i.e., `ar[i-1]`) is equal to `num`. The length of `ar` must be greater than 4, and since `i` is 5, `ar` has been updated with the first 6 integers from the input.
