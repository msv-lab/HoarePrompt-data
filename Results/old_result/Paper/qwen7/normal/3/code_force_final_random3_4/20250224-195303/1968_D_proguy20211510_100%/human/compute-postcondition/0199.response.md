Output State: **`pres` is increased by `paths[i]`, `i` is `len(paths) + 1`, `k` is an integer less than `len(paths) + 1`, `ress` is the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `curr` is equal to `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`**

Explanation:
- The code `pres += paths[i]` increments `pres` by the value of `paths[i]`.
- The value of `i` remains `len(paths) + 1`.
- The value of `k` remains an integer less than `len(paths) + 1`.
- The value of `ress` remains the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`.
- The value of `curr` remains `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`.
