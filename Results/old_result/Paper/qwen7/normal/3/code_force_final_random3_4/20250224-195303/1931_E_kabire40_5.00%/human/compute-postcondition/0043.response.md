Output State: **`x` is 4, `rev_res` is a string concatenated with '4', `val_in` is an integer 4.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res += str(val_in)` appends the string representation of `val_in` to `rev_res`. Given that `val_in` is the integer obtained by converting `rev_val[4]` to an integer and `rev_val[4]` is 4 (since `x` is 4), `val_in` is 4. Therefore, `rev_res` is updated to include the string '4'. The value of `x` remains unchanged.
