You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

Initially, it calculates `max_value` using `func_1(start_index, end_index)`. If the length of the subarray is 1, it checks if the element at `start_index` is non-positive; if so, it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it returns a list containing a single tuple `(start_index, start_index)`. If `max_value` equals the square of the length, it constructs a list containing a tuple `(start_index, end_index)` after calling `make_stairs(length - 1)`. For other cases, it iterates through the subarray, checking if the sum of elements and recursive function calls equals `max_value`. Based on the conditions met, it either returns a concatenated result of recursive calls or specific recursive calls.

If `arr[start_index + i] == i` is true, then the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called. Otherwise, the elements in the array `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i + 1` are all set to the value `i-1`, and the list `res` contains tuples indicating these operations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_stairs` checks if a segment of the list `arr` starting from index `start_index` forms a "stairs" pattern, where each element at index `start_index + j` equals `j`. If it does, the function does nothing and returns `None`. If not, the function modifies the list `arr` by setting a sequence of elements to a specific value and records the operations in the list `res`. The function continues to recursively adjust segments of `arr` until the entire list satisfies the "stairs" pattern or the recursion reaches its base case. The function does not return any value; instead, it modifies the input list `arr` and populates the list `res` with the operations performed.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
   - Each operation sets all elements from index `l` to `r` to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of the subarray \([a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r]\).

2. **Key Concepts**:
   - **MEX**: The smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - **Operations**: We can perform up to \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.

3. **Code Structure**:
   - The code defines three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs`.
   - `func_1` computes the maximum possible sum of the subarray using dynamic programming.
   - `func_2` finds the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
   - `make_stairs` is intended to create a staircase pattern to achieve the maximum sum.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the maximum sum of subarrays.
   - It checks all possible splits of the subarray and recursively calculates the maximum sum for each split.
   - The base case handles single-element subarrays.
   - The function returns the maximum sum for the given subarray.

5. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
   - It uses the results from `func_1` to identify the subarrays where the MEX value can be used to maximize the sum.
   - However, the logic here seems flawed:
     - The function does not correctly handle the construction of operations.
     - It attempts to reconstruct the operations but does not ensure that the operations are applied in a way that maximizes the sum.
     - The function does not properly account for the MEX value being applied to the entire subarray.

6. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - This function is supposed to create a staircase pattern to achieve the maximum sum.
   - However, the function is incomplete and does not correctly implement the logic to set the elements to the MEX value.

### Conclusion:
- The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Specifically, `func_2` and `make_stairs` do not correctly generate the operations needed to maximize the sum of the array elements.
- The logic for finding the optimal operations is flawed, and the code does not ensure that the operations are applied in a way that maximizes the sum.
