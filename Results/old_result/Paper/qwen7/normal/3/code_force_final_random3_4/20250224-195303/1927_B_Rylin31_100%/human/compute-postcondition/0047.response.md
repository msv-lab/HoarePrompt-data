Output State: **`array` must contain at least one element; `ans` is the concatenation of `ans` and the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97`; `s[j]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` appends a character to the string `ans`. The character is derived from the value of `s[j]` by adding 97 (which corresponds to the ASCII value of 'a') and converting it to a character using `chr()`. Additionally, `s[j]` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions of `array` containing at least one element and `s[j]` being incremented by 1 remain unchanged.
