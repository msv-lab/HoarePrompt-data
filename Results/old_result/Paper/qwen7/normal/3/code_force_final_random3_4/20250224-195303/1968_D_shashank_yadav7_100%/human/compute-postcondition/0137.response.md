Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` must be greater than 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `s = p[s] - 1` updates the value of `s` by assigning it the value of `p[s] - 1`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid. The value of `b` remains as `p[b] - 1`, and now `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`.
