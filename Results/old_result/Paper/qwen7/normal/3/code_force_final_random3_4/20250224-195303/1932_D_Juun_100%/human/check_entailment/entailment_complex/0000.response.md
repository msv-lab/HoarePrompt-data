Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input parameters including the number of test cases, the number of rounds, the trump suit, and the list of cards.
2. The logic for handling trump cards and non-trump cards is correctly implemented. Cards of the trump suit are collected separately, and non-trump cards are matched with the highest available non-trump card of the same suit.
3. The program ensures that if a valid sequence of moves cannot be reconstructed, it correctly outputs "IMPOSSIBLE".
4. The program handles the output in the required format, printing the moves for each round and ensuring the correct order of trump card pairs.
5. The overall structure and flow of the program align with the problem statement and the expected behavior.

Given the above points, the annotated program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
