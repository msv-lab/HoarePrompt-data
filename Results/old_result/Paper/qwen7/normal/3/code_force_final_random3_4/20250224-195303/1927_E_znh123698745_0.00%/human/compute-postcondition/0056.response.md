Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `array` is unchanged, `answer` has the element `array[a[0]]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends `array[a[0]]` to the list `answer`. Since `a` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we cannot determine its value. However, we know that `array` remains unchanged, `i` remains 3, and `n` remains an input integer. The `answer` list now contains one additional element, which is `array[a[0]]`.
