Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", `trumps` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to `None`, `answers` is an empty list, `card` is a tuple where the first element is assigned to `rank` and the second element is assigned to `suit`**.

Explanation: The code `rank, suit = card` unpacks the tuple `card` into two variables, `rank` and `suit`. The values of `t`, `n`, `trumps`, `suits`, and `answers` remain unchanged from their initial states.
