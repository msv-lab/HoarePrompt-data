Output State: **`d` is a dictionary with key `i` and value `1`, `pl` is a list, and `i` is the next element in `palka`.**

The code `d[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. The list `pl` and the variable `i` (which is the next element in `palka`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
