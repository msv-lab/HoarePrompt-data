Output State: **The program returns a list that is the concatenation of `output2` (list of quotients) and `output1` (list of divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to \(\sqrt{x}\) in descending order)**.

This means the program returns a list where first come the quotients of `x` divided by its divisors that are less than or equal to \(\sqrt{x}\) (in the order of these divisors), followed by the divisors themselves (in descending order).
