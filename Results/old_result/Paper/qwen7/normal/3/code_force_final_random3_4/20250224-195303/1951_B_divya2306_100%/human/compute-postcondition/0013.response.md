Postcondition: `wins` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element from the input split into an integer, `i` is 1, and if `a[i] > a[k - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
