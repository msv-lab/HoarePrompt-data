Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to len(vx) - 4 with `v1` removed, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`, and `v2` remains unchanged.**

The code appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. The values of `t`, `n`, `vx`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged except for the addition of the tuple to the list `ops`.
