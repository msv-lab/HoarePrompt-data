Output State: **`arr` now contains a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)`, `N` is a valid integer input, the current value of `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to the list `arr`. The values of `N` and the condition about `nums[i]` remain unchanged.
