Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
- The value of `k` is a power of 2, and `k & (k - 1)` equals 0.

The condition `k & (k - 1)` equals 0 indicates that `k` is a power of 2. Powers of 2 have the property that in their binary representation, they consist of a single 1 followed by zeros (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...).

Given that `k` is a power of 2 and the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, the value of `k` must be a specific power of 2. Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `k`. However, we know it is a power of 2.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `k`, which is a power of 2.

Output: **k (where k is a power of 2)**
