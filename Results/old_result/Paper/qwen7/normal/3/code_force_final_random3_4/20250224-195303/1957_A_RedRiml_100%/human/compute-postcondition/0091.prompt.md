Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `shapes` is increased by the total count of each element in `palka` divided by 3, `pl` is an empty list, `w` is decreased by 1, `palka` is updated to a list of integers based on user input, and the count of each element in `d` is greater than or equal to 3 after all iterations; `d` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `d` is a dictionary and `pl` is a list. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `d[i]` is set to 1. If `i` is already in `d`, then `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `d` is a dictionary and `pl` is a list; `pl` contains the next element of `i`; if `i` was not in `d`, it is now added with a value of 1, otherwise its value is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `d` is a dictionary and `pl` now contains the next element of `i`, which is the next element in `palka`. If `i` was not previously a key in `d`, its value is set to 1. If `i` was already a key in `d`, its value is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
