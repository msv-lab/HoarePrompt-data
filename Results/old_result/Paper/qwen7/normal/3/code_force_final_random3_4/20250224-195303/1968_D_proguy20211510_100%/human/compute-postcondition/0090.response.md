Output State: **`i` is 3, `pres` plus `paths[3] * (k - 3)` is the new value of `curr`, and if `k` is less than `i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is assigned the value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`. Given that `i` is 3, `curr` becomes `pres + paths[3] * (k - 3)`. The conditions regarding `k` and the loop or if statement remain unchanged.
