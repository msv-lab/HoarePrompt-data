Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, `minn` and `mex` are updated based on the value of `arr[i + 1]`. Specifically, if `arr[i] > 0`, then `minn` is either `maxx + 1` (if `minn == maxx`), or it is increased by 1 (if `minn != maxx`), and `mex` is appended with the current value of `minn`. Otherwise, `maxx` is the maximum of the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` and the absolute difference between `arr[i + 1]` and `minn`.
