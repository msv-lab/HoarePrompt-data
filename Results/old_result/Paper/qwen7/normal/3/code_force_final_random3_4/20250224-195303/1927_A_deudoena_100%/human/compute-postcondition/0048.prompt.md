You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10 and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character in s is 'B'.
def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'; `j` is the last character in the string `s`; `c` is equal to `n`; `mi` is the index (1-based) of the first 'B' in the string `s`, or 0 if there is no 'B' in the string. The variable `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, and the other variables (`ma`, `t`, `n`, `m`) retain their initial values.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: Postcondition: `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'; `j` is the last character in the original string `s`; `c` is `n`; `mi` is the index (1-based) of the first 'B' in the string `s`, or 0 if there is no 'B' in the string `s`; `d` is `n`; `l` is an empty list; `ma` is `0`.
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns a value which is the result of subtracting the index of the first 'B' (or 0 if no 'B' exists) from 'ma' (which is 0), and then adding 2.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes a string `s` of length `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10) consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', and an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). It returns a value calculated by subtracting the index of the first 'B' in the string `s` from 0 (ma), and then adding 2. If no 'B' exists in the string, the function returns 2.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a value which is the result of subtracting the index of the first 'B' (or 0 if no 'B' exists) from 'ma' (which is 0), and then adding 2.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
