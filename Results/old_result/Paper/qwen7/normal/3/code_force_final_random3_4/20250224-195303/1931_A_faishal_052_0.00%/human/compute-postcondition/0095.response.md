Output State: `cases` is 3, `arr` is one of the following lists: `[1, 1, 1]`, `[26, 1, 1]`, `[1, 26, 1]`, `[26, 26, 1]`, `[1, 1, 26]`, `[26, 1, 26]`, `[1, 26, 26]`, `[26, 26, 26]`, `j` is 2, and `lex` is an input integer reduced by either 1 or 26 depending on whether `lex` is less than or equal to 26.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., 2 times as specified by the `range(2)`), the list `arr` will contain exactly 3 elements, each of which is either 1 or 26. The value of `lex` will have been reduced by either 1 or 26 for each iteration of the loop, depending on the condition that was met during that iteration. The variable `cases` remains unchanged at 3, and `j` will be 2 since the loop runs twice.
