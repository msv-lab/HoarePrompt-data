Output State: **`j` is 1, `ans` is `s[1-1] * 2 + s[1] * 2`, `x` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `ans` was initially set to `s[x-1] * 2`. Given that `x` is 1, `s[x-1]` is `s[0]`. So, `ans` was initially `s[0] * 2`. After executing `ans += s[x] * 2`, `ans` is updated to `s[0] * 2 + s[1] * 2`. The values of `j` and `x` remain unchanged.
