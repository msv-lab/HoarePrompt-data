Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `i` is 2, `x` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `y` is the second integer from the input converted to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
