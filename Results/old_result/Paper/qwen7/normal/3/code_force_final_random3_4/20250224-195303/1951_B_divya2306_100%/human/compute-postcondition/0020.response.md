Output State: `wins` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element from the input split into an integer, `i` is 3.

**Explanation**: The loop continues to increment `wins` as long as `a[i]` is less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`. After the loop has executed 3 times, `i` is 2, and the condition `a[2] > a[k - 1]` is not met (otherwise, the loop would have broken earlier). Therefore, the loop will continue until `i` reaches `n` or until `a[i] > a[k - 1]` is true. Since the loop has already executed 3 times without breaking, it means that the next elements in the list `a` up to `a[2]` are all less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`. Thus, `wins` will remain 3 after all iterations of the loop have finished.
