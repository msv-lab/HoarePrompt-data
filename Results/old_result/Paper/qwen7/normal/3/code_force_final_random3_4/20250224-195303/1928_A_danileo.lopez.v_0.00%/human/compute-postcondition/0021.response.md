Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is \(t-1\), `a` and `b` are integers from the input, and if either `a` or `b` is even, they remain unchanged. If both `a` and `b` are odd, they remain unchanged as well.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` will still be within the range of 1 to 10^4 (inclusive), and `_` will be equal to \(t-1\) because the loop runs `t` times, decrementing `_` each iteration. The values of `a` and `b` will remain unchanged unless one of them is even, in which case `a` or `b` (or both) will be printed as 'Yes' and will retain their original values. If both `a` and `b` are odd, they will be printed as 'No' and will retain their original values.
