Reasoning:

1. The problem requires processing multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers \(x\) and \(y\).
2. For each test case, the program should output the minimum of \(x\) and \(y\) followed by the maximum of \(x\) and \(y\).
3. The provided code defines a function `func()` which reads the number of test cases \(t\), and then processes each test case by reading pairs of integers \(x\) and \(y\).
4. Inside the loop, the code correctly compares \(x\) and \(y\) and prints the minimum and maximum values accordingly.
5. The logic inside the loop is correct and handles the comparison and printing of the minimum and maximum values for each pair of integers.
6. The loop iterates exactly \(t\) times, ensuring all test cases are processed.
7. There are no logical errors or missing parts in the provided code that would cause it to fail according to the problem description.

Given the above points, the provided code meets all the requirements of the problem statement and functions correctly.

Correctness: **True**
