t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers satisfying 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m, k <= 2 * 10^5. The list a contains n integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems, sorted in strictly increasing order. The list d contains m integers representing the complexities of the models. The list f contains k integers representing the complexities of the functions.
