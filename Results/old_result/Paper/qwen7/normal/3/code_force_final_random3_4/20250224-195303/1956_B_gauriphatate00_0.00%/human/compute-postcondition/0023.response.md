Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + n`, `n` is `int(data[idx])`, `a` is a list of integers created by mapping `int` over the slice of `data` from `idx` to `idx + n`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a)`, `t` is `t - 1 and must be greater than 1**.

Explanation: The code appends the return value of `func_1(n, a)` to the `results` list. This does not change the values of `data`, `idx`, `n`, `a`, or `t`. The value of `idx` is updated to `idx + n`, `n` remains `int(data[idx])`, `a` remains a list of integers created by mapping `int` over the slice of `data` from `idx` to `idx + n`, and `results` gains an additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a)`. The condition for `t` remains `t - 1 and must be greater than 1`.
