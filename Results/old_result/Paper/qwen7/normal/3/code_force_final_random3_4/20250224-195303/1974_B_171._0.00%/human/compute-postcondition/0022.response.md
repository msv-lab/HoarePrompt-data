Output State: **All characters from 'a' to 'z' are checked in the loop, and if `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, it is mapped to `char`. The loop breaks as soon as a character is mapped; `decoded` is appended with the character `chr(c)`.**

Explanation: The code appends `chr(c)` to the list `decoded`. Since `c` represents a character from 'a' to 'z', `chr(c)` will be a character within that range. The loop continues to check each character until one is mapped (i.e., added to `decoded`). After appending `chr(c)`, the loop condition is met, and the loop breaks. Therefore, the only change is the addition of `chr(c)` to `decoded`.
