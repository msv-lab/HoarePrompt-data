Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, w is an input integer.**

The code `w = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `w`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet.
