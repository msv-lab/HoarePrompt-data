Output State: **`i` is 1; `w` is an integer such that `w` is the integer part of the square root of `q` and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`; `q` is divisible by `i`; `M` is a list containing the elements 1 and `q // i`; the value of `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [q // i]` appends the value of `q // i` to the list `M`. Since `i` is 1, `q // i` is simply `q`. Therefore, `M` now contains the elements 1 and `q`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
