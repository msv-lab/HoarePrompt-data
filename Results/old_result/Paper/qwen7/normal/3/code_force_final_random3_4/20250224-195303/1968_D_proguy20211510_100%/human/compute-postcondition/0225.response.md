Output State: **`num_iterations` is decremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the original `n`, `k` is the integer value of the original `k`, `pb` is the integer value of the original `pb`, `ps` is the integer value of the original `ps`**.

This means that the `num_iterations` variable has been decremented by 1, while `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` have been converted from their original string values to integers.
