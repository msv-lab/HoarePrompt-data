Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to handle the logic for a single test case. However, within this function, it incorrectly reads `m` again, which should not be necessary since `n` was already read in the main loop.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The function initializes `ma` and `mi` to 0.
   - It then iterates through the string `s` to find the first occurrence of 'B' and sets `mi` to the index of this 'B'. This is correct.
   - It then iterates through the reversed string `s` to find the last occurrence of 'B' and sets `ma` to the distance from the end of the string to this 'B'. This is also correct.
   - Finally, it returns `ma - mi + 2`.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The formula `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect. The correct logic should be `max(ma, mi)`. The minimum segment length to turn all cells white is the maximum distance from the start or end to the nearest 'B'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string starts with 'B', `mi` will be 1, and `ma` will be `n`. The correct answer should be `n`.
   - If the string ends with 'B', `ma` will be 1, and `mi` will be `n`. The correct answer should be `n`.

Given these points, the current implementation does not correctly calculate the minimum segment length. The correct implementation should be:

```python
def func_1():
    s = input()
    mi = s.find('B') + 1
    ma = s.rfind('B') + 1
    return max(mi, ma)
```

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
