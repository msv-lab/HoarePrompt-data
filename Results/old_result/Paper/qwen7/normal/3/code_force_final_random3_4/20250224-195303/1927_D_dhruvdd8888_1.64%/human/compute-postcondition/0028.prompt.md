Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is in the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n; `N` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())` with an additional element `-1` appended to it; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `num` is the first element of the list `nums`; `arr` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N + 1):
    if nums[i] != num:
        arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
        s = i
    num = nums[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `N` is a valid integer input, `arr` now contains a new tuple `(4, i, num)`, `num` is equal to `nums[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `num` is equal to `nums[i]`, `i` is equal to `s`, and `i` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same depending on whether `nums[i]` is equal to `num`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `num` is equal to `nums[i]`, `i` is equal to `s + 1`, `s` is equal to `i`, and `arr` contains a new tuple `(2 + s, i, num)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
