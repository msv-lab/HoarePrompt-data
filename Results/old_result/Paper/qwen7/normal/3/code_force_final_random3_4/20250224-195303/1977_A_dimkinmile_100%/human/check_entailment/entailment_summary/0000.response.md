Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by defining a function `func_1()` which processes the input values `n` and `m`. The logic inside `func_1()` correctly checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative. This ensures that the number of moves can result in a tower with exactly `m` cubes. The program iterates over each test case using a loop that calls `func_1()` for each case. The function reads the input for each test case and prints the appropriate response ('Yes' or 'No') directly to the console.

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the program's logic aligns with the requirements. It correctly handles each test case and outputs the expected results based on the conditions specified.

Correctness: **True**
