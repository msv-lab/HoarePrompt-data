Postcondition: `arr[i]` is an integer less than or equal to 0, and `mex` is a list containing the value `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. If `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, then the current value of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` remains unchanged. Otherwise, there is no specified change to the values in `mex`.
