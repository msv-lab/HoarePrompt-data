Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Initial State:**
   - `sum`: This variable accumulates values based on certain conditions inside the loop.
   - `j`: Starts from `n + r + 1` and remains unchanged throughout the loop.
   - `n`: Initially 0, and it is decremented to 0 after the loop.
   - `t`: Retains its value from the last iteration of the loop.
   - `r`: Last value of `i` that satisfied the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists.
   - `i`: Starts from 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration until `n` becomes 0.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - Since `n` is initially 0, the loop will not execute because the condition `n > 0` is false.
   - Therefore, `sum` will not accumulate any values during the loop.

3. **Values of Variables at the End:**
   - `sum`: Since the loop does not execute, `sum` remains unchanged from its initial state.
   - `n`: After the loop, `n` is explicitly set to 0.
   - `t`: Retains its value from the last iteration, but since the loop does not execute, `t` remains unchanged.
   - `r`: Also retains its value from the last iteration, but since the loop does not execute, `r` remains unchanged.
   - `i`: Starts from 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration until `n` becomes 0. Since `n` is 0, `i` will be 0 after the loop.

4. **Calculating `j`:**
   - `j` starts from `n + r + 1` and remains unchanged. Since `n` is 0 and `r` is also 0 (as the loop does not execute), `j` will be `0 + 0 + 1 = 1`.

5. **Final Values:**
   - `sum`: Accumulated value based on the conditions inside the loop, but since the loop does not execute, `sum` remains unchanged.
   - `n + r`: Since both `n` and `r` are 0, `n + r` is 0.

6. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement will output the values of `sum` and `n + r`.

Given the above reasoning, the output will be:

Output: **sum, 0**
