Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the value of `n` is input from the user; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user using `input()`, splits the input into individual strings using `.split()`, and then converts each string to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. These integers are collected into a list named `arr`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
