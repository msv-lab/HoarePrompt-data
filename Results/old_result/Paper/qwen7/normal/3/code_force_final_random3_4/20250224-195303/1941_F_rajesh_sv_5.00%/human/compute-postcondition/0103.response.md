Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `l` is equal to `h`, `mid` is the midpoint between `l` and `h` during the last iteration, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of the difference between `D[l] + f` and `left`, and the difference between `right` and `D[l] + f`. The variable `l` is now equal to `h`, indicating that the search range has narrowed down to a single point. The values of `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` remain as they were during the last iteration.
