Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, and if the elements at index 0 of arrays `a` and `b` are equal, then `c[0]` is not equal to `a[0]` (or `b[0]`), and the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the elements at index 0 of arrays `a` and `b` are not equal, then `possible` is set to True, and the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
