Output State: **`xx` is a 2D list, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `j + 1`, `nx` is the string that was previously concatenated with the value of `xx[i][j-1]` if it is not '?', otherwise it is appended with 'S' or 'F' based on whether `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`.**

This means that the value of `nx` has been updated by concatenating the value of `xx[i][j-1]` to it, unless `xx[i][j-1]` is '?', in which case 'S' or 'F' is appended based on the conditions involving `i` and `j`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
