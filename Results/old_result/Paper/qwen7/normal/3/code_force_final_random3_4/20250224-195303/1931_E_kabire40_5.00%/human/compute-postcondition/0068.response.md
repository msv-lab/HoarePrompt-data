Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the first string in the list.**

Explanation: The code reverses the first string in the `operational_list` and converts it to an integer, assigning this integer to `x_rev`. The other elements of `operational_list` remain unchanged.
