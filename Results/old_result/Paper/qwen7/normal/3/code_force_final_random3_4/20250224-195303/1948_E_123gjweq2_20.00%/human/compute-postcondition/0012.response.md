Output State: **`cliquess[left + i]` is set to `clique`, `arr[left + (i + 1)]` is set to `small_element + (i + 1)`, `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i`, `i` is `i + 2`, `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i + 2**.

Explanation: The code `cliquess[left + i] = clique` updates the value of `cliquess[left + i]` to `clique`. The other assignments and conditions remain unchanged, so the values of `arr[left + (i + 1)]`, `arr[left + i]`, `i`, and `arr[left + i]` are preserved as per their previous states.
