Postcondition: **`f` is the next value in the sequence defined by `F`, `l` is the index obtained by bisecting the list `D` with the value `left - f`, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. The difference between `mid_sum - left` is greater than or equal to `right - mid_next_sum`**
