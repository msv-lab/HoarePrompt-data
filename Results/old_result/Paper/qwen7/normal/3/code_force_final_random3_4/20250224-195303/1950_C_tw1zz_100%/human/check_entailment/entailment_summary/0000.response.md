Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Redundant Code**: The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to handle each possible hour value from '00' to '23'. This approach is inefficient and can be simplified.
2. **Incorrect Conversion Logic**: The logic for converting hours is flawed. For example, when `h == '00'`, it correctly sets `h1` to '12' and `time` to 'AM', but this logic is repeated unnecessarily for other hours that should also be converted to 12-hour format.
3. **Lack of Generalization**: The program does not generalize the conversion logic, making it prone to errors and difficult to maintain.

A more efficient and correct approach would be to use the modulo operation to handle the conversion. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        h1 = str((int(h) % 12) or 12)  # Convert 24-hour to 12-hour format
        time = 'AM' if int(h) < 12 else 'PM'
        print(f'{h1}:{m} {time}')
```

This version uses the modulo operation to handle the conversion and simplifies the logic significantly.

Given the current implementation, the program is incorrect due to the redundant and flawed logic.

Correctness: **False**
