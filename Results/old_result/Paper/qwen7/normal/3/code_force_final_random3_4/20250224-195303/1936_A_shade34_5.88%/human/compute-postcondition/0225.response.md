Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is at least 2, `s` is the new string input by the user, `mak` is `i`, `pans` is a list containing the value `i` appended to itself if `s` equals '=', otherwise `pans` contains the value `i`, `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. The values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
