Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`. This means that `i` will increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is an index within the list.
   - `tmp` is an integer.
   - `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `i` in list `a` equals `tmp`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.
   - `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `cnt`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current index.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be the old value of `i` plus 1.
   - The conditions for `cnt` and `ans` remain the same as they depend on the current values of `a[i]` and `tmp`, which do not change just because `i` increments.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `a` remains the same list of integers.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `tmp` remains the same integer.
   - `cnt` and `ans` remain unchanged unless the new value of `a[i]` (which is `a[i+1]` in the next iteration) matches `tmp`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list that is 1 more than the previous value of `i`, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `i` in list `a` equals `tmp`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `cnt`.**
