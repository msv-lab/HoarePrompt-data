Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the length of the list `S`, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `right` from `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]` to `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`. Since `i` is 1, the new value of `right` becomes `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
