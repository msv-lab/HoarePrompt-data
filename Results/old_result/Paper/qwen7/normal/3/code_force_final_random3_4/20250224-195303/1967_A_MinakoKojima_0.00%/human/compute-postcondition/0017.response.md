Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is the first integer input.
   - `k` is reduced by `min(k, m + k // n - a[1])`.
   - `a[1]` is `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[1])`.
   - `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[1])`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` remains the same because it is the first integer input and does not change within the loop.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` remains the same (the first integer input).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the first integer input**
