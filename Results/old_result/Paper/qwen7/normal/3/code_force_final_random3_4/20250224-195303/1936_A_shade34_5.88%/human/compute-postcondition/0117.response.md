Output State: **`mak` is `i`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is either `n-1` or any value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, `i` is now in the list `pans`, `pans` contains `[i]`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 1, `pans` is no longer an empty list and contains the element `i`, `s` is an input string, and the current value of `s` is `<`.**

This output state reflects that the variable `pans` has been updated to contain the value of `i`, while all other variables retain their previous states, except that `pans` is no longer empty.
