Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ppp` is explicitly given as 23.
   - `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers. Since their exact values are not provided, we cannot determine them precisely.
   - `arr` is a list, but no specific elements are mentioned.
   - `eli` and `LA` are not explicitly defined, so we cannot determine their values.
   - `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at the index determined by `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s - 1, s)
   ```

Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `s` is part of a tuple at the index determined by `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- We need to determine the value of `s` to understand what will be printed.

Since `s`, `e`, and `_` are taken from a tuple in `arr` at the index determined by `min(eli, LA)`, and without knowing the exact values of `eli`, `LA`, and `arr`, we cannot determine the exact value of `s`. However, we can still describe the output format.

The output will be the value of `s - 1` followed by the value of `s`.

Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the first element of the tuple at the index determined by min(eli, LA) in the list arr)**
