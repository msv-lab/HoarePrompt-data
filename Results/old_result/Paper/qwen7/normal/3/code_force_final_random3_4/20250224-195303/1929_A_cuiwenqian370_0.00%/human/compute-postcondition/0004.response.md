Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `left <= right`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `left` is 0
   - `right` is \( n - 1 \)
   - `new_arr` is an empty list

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `left <= right` must be true.
   - Currently, `left` is 0 and `right` is \( n - 1 \).
   - Since \( n \) is an integer, \( n - 1 \) is a valid integer.
   - To satisfy the condition `left <= right`, `right` must be greater than or equal to `left`.

Given that `left` is 0, `right` must be at least 0 for the loop to execute the first time. Therefore, we need to ensure that `right` is greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `left` and `right`, so we can only adjust those.
   - We need to ensure that `right` is greater than or equal to 0.

Thus, the modified state right before the loop should be:

State: **`left` is 0, `right` must be greater than or equal to 0, `new_arr` is an empty list**
