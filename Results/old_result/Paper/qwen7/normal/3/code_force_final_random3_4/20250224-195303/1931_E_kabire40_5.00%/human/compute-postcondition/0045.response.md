Output State: **`x` is 4; `rev_res` is the character at index 4 of `rev_res` followed by that character reversed.**

Explanation: The code appends the reverse of `val_in` (which is the character at index 4 of `rev_res`) to `rev_res`. Since `val_in` is the character at index 4 of `rev_res`, appending its reverse does not change `rev_res`. Therefore, `rev_res` remains unchanged except for the fact that it now includes itself appended at the end.
