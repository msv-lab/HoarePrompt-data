Given the initial state where `j` is 2 and `n` is a positive integer, the `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. Since `n` is a positive integer but its exact value is not specified, we cannot provide a specific range. However, we know it will print numbers starting from 1 up to `n`.

Output: **1 2 ... n (where n is a positive integer)**
