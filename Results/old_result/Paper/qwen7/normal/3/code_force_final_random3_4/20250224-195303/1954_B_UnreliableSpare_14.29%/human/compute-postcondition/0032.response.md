Postcondition: **`flag` remains `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), and `i` is `n`; `cnt` is increased by 1, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum between `ans` and `cnt` if `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`.**
