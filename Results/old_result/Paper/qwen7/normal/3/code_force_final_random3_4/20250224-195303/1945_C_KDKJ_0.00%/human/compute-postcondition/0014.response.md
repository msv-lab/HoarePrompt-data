Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1'; `S` is a list containing a sublist [x, y] where x and y are determined based on the last character of `a`; `x` is the last element of the last sublist in `S`; `y` is the second last element of the last sublist in `S`.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = S[-1]` assigns the last sublist of `S` to the variables `x` and `y`. Since `S` contains a single sublist [x, y], `x` is set to the last element of this sublist (which is `y` from the initial state), and `y` is set to the second last element of this sublist (which is `x` from the initial state). The initial conditions for `a` and `S` remain unchanged.
