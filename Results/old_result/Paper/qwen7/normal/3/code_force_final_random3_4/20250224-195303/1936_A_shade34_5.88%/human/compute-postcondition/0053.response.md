Output State: **`s` is a new string input from the user, `mak` is `k + 1`, `pans` is a list containing the value `k + 1`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `n` is the same as before the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is `k + 1`) to the variable `mak`. All other variables remain unchanged.
