Output State: **`i` is 0, `length` is 30, and the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is greater than 0; `s` contains the element '1'.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. The values of `i` and `length` remain unchanged. The condition involving `x` and `i` (bitwise AND of `x` and \(2^i\) being greater than 0) also remains true.
