Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 4, `t` must be greater than 4, `done` is False, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is a string, `done` is True, `count` is greater than 0, and `count2` is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged depending on whether the character at index `j` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`. If the characters are not equal, the loop or if statement is broken out of regardless of the condition `count2 < count`. If the characters are equal, `count2` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a string, `done` is True, `count` is `j`, `count2` is either incremented by 1, reset to 0, or remains unchanged, `j` is `n`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement if either `count2` is greater than `count` or `count` is greater than 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, we continue the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a string, `done` is True, `count` is `j`, and `count2` is either incremented by 1, reset to 0, or remains unchanged. `j` is `n`. If `count2` is less than `count` and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `s[j]` is set to `x`. If `count2` equals `count`, `count2` is set to 0. If `count2` is greater than `count` and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `s[j]` is set to `x`. If none of these conditions are met, the values of `s`, `done`, `count`, `count2`, and `j` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
