Postcondition: `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 4, `output1` is a list containing the values [3, 5] if `x` is divisible by 5, otherwise it remains [3], and `output2` is a list containing the value [int(x / 5)] if `x` is divisible by 5, otherwise it remains an empty list.
