Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. It uses a dictionary to keep track of the residues of the array elements modulo `x` and `y`, and counts the pairs accordingly. This approach ensures that all pairs `(i, j)` where `1 ≤ i < j ≤ n` and both conditions are satisfied are counted.

The program processes multiple test cases efficiently using the `sys.stdin.read` method to read all input at once, which is suitable for large inputs. The implementation handles all described constraints and examples provided, ensuring that the solution is correct for the given problem description.
