State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 1**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(t):`.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate numbers from 0 to `t-1`.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts (as is the case with `range(t)`).
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be set to 1 if we want to align with typical loop initialization where `i` starts from 0.

Hence, the required state adjustments are that `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 1.
