Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with one element set to 1, indicating a cycle was detected, `num_iterations` is fully decremented to 0, `n` is the integer value of the original `n`, `k` is the integer value of the original `k`, `pb` remains at the final value it was set to after the last iteration, `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]` after the last iteration, `p` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `pathb` is a list containing all the elements added during each iteration of the loop that must have at least 1 element, `paths` is a list containing all the elements `a[ps - 1]` appended from each iteration until the loop broke, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `pres` is 0, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)**

Explanation: The line `preb += pathb[i]` updates the value of `preb` by adding `pathb[i] * (k - i)` to its current value. Since `preb` was previously `preb`, the new value of `preb` is now `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
