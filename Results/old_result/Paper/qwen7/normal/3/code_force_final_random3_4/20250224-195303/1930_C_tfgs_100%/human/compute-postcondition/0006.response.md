Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `a[1]` is 2 (This variable is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted.)

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` was 1, it will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration.
   - `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
