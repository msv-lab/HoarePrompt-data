Output State: **`arr[i]` is an integer, and `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0; `mex` is a list containing the value abs(`arr[i] - minn`); the current value of abs(`arr[i] - minn`) is equal to `maxx`.**

Explanation: The code updates `maxx` to be the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`. Since `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0 and `minn` is the minimum value in `arr`, the value of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is now stored in `maxx`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
