Postcondition: `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n`, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1, `t` is an input integer representing the number of remaining iterations, `r` is `i` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, otherwise `r` is 0, and the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` determines which value `sum` takes.
