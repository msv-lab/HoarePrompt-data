Output State: **`j` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `s[j]` is `s[1]`; `count` is 1; `count2` is either 0 or 1; and `done` is True.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified within the statement itself, the values of all variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
