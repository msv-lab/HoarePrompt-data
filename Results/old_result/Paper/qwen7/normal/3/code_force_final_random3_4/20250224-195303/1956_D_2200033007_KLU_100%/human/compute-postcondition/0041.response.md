Output State: The loop will continue to increment `j` from `start_index` up to `start_index + i + 1`. After all iterations, `j` will reach `start_index + i + 1`, and every element in the array `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i + 1` will be set to the value `i`. The variable `res` will contain tuples of the form `(start_index, start_index + k)` for each `k` in the range `0` to `i + 1`. The variable `is_already_stairs` will remain `False`, and `start_index` and `i` will retain their final values after the loop completes.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, the elements in the array `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i + 1` will all be set to the value `i`. The list `res` will contain tuples indicating the operations performed, and the other variables will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
