Output State: **`total` is 0, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2 + 1`, `mid_sum` is undefined, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`**.

Explanation: The variable `l` is reassigned to `mid + 1`. Since `mid` was previously defined as `l + (h - l) // 2`, the new value of `l` becomes `l + (h - l) // 2 + 1`. The values of `total`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` are not directly affected by this line of code, but `mid_sum` becomes undefined because `mid` has changed and it is no longer valid to refer to it in the same context. The value of `mid_next_sum` remains as `D[mid + 1] + f` since only `l` was updated and `mid + 1` is still referenced in its calculation.
