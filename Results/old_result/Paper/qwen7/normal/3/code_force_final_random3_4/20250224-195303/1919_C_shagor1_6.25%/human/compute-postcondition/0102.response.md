Output State: **`x` is equal to `y`, `a` is greater than `y`, and `y` is equal to `a`.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is assigned the value of `a`. Since `a` is greater than both `x` and `y` in the initial state, after the assignment, `y` becomes equal to `a`. The relationship between `x` and `y` remains unchanged as `x` is still equal to `y`. Therefore, `x` is equal to `y`, and `a` is greater than `y` (which is now equal to `a`).
