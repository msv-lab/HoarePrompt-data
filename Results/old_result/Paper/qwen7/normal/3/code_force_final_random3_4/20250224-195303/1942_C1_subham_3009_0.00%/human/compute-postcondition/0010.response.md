Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `[n, x, y]` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the list `[n, x, y]`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was already defined in the initial state and no operation alters its value. Therefore, `t` is still greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`. The list `[n, x, y]` is updated with the values from the input.
