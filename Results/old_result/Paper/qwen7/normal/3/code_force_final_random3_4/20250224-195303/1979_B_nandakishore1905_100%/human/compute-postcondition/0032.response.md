Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `k` is not a power of 2, `k` is either odd or even, `f` is 0, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is 2.**

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if and else parts. If `k` is odd, it remains odd. If `k` is even, it becomes even, and through the process of reducing `f` by `q` (which is 2), `f` eventually reaches 0. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, and `p`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the operations within the if-else block.
