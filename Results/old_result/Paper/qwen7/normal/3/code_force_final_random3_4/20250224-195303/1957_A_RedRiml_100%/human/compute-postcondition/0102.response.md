Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head involves the variable `j` and the list `pl`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as there is an element `j` in `pl` such that `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `shapes` is either `0 + (d[j] // 3)` or `0`.
   - `d` is a dictionary where the count of each element in `palka` is stored.
   - `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered.
   - `j` is such that `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, but it will be the next element in `pl` that satisfies this condition.
   - `pl` will be updated to exclude the current `j`.

4. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is the next element in `pl` that satisfies `d[j] >= 3`, the next value of `j` will be the next element in `pl` that meets this condition.
   - `pl` will be updated to exclude the current `j`, so the next `j` will be the next element in the updated `pl`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `shapes` will be recalculated based on the new `j` and `d[j]`.
   - `d` remains unchanged.
   - `pl` will be updated to exclude the current `j`.
   - `j` will be the next element in the updated `pl` that satisfies `d[j] >= 3`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `shapes` will be `0 + (d[j] // 3)` or `0`, where `j` is the next element in the updated `pl`.
- `d` remains unchanged.
- `pl` is updated to exclude the current `j`.
- `j` is the next element in the updated `pl` that satisfies `d[j] >= 3`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`shapes` is either 0 + (d[j] // 3) or 0, `d` is a dictionary where the count of each element in `palka` is stored, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered excluding the current `j`, and `j` is the next element in the updated `pl` that satisfies d[j] >= 3**.
