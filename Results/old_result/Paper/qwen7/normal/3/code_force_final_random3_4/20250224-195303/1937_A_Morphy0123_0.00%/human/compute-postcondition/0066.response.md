Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` must be greater than 5, `i` is either 3 or 6, `n` is the integer input from the user. If `n` equals 1, then `power` is set to 4. Otherwise, `power` is set to the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `n`, and `n` must be greater than 128. If `power` equals `n`, then `power` remains unchanged.
