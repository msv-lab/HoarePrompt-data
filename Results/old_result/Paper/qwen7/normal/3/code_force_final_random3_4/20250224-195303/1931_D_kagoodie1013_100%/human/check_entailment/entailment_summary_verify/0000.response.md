### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function summary to validate the original assessment.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` takes a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains:
  - `n`: the size of the array.
  - `x`: Polycarp's favorite integer.
  - `y`: Polycarp's another favorite integer.
  - `arr`: a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array.
- For each array in `test_cases`, it initializes a counter `count` to zero.
- It uses a dictionary `residue_map` to store the frequency of residues of the array elements modulo `x` and `y`.
- For each element `num` in the array, it calculates:
  - `r_x = -num % x`: This computes the remainder when `-num` is divided by `x`.
  - `r_y = num % y`: This computes the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
- It then increments the `count` by the number of times the pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been seen before in the `residue_map`.
- Finally, it updates the `residue_map` with the current `(r_x, r_y)` pair.
- The function appends the `count` to the `results` list and returns this list after processing all test cases.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into tokens.
- It processes each test case by extracting `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
- It calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and prints the results.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies pairs `(i, j)` where:
  - `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
  - `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
- The use of `residue_map` ensures that all pairs are counted efficiently without needing to explicitly iterate over all possible pairs `(i, j)` (which would be inefficient for large arrays).
- The program handles multiple test cases efficiently by reading all input upfront and processing them sequentially.
- The constraints and examples provided are handled correctly by the program.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions.

### Final:
**True**
