Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`), the array itself (`nums`), and the number of queries (`q`).
2. It then processes each query, finding a pair of indices `i` and `j` within the specified range `[l, r]` such that `a_i â‰  a_j`.
3. To achieve this, the program constructs a list of tuples (`arr`) that represent segments of consecutive identical elements in the array `nums`. Each tuple contains the start index, end index, and the value of the segment.
4. For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment in `arr` that overlaps with the query range `[l, r]`.
5. Based on the position of the segment relative to the query range, it determines whether there exists a pair of indices `i` and `j` that satisfy the conditions or prints `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

Given the detailed explanation and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correct and should handle the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
