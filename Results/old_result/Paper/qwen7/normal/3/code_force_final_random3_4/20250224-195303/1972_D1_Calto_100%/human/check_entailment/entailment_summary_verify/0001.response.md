### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the provided function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Given Functions Recap:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: Computes the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm. This function is correct.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: The original assessment claims that this function is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Function Summary Recap:
The summary states that after completing the iterations, the function returns 20 with specific values of `i`, `x`, and `y`. However, these values do not align with the problem requirements. Specifically, the function does not check the required condition at all.

#### Detailed Analysis:
- The function `func_2(n, m)` iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
- For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
- It then increments the count `cnt` by `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

This logic does not relate to the problem constraints. The expressions \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\) are not relevant to the problem. The function does not check whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for any pair \((a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided function `func_2(n, m)` does not do this.

### Final Evaluation:

Since the function `func_2(n, m)` does not correctly implement the required logic and does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), the program is indeed incorrect.

**Final: False**
