The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` (which is a placeholder variable) and the variable `testcases`. Since the placeholder variable `_` does not affect the loop's execution, we only need to focus on adjusting the state of `testcases`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `func_6()` has been called. The loop condition is determined by `testcases`. For the loop to execute one more time, `testcases` must be greater than 0.

Let's assume that `testcases` was decremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `testcases` must be greater than 0.

State: **`func_6()` has been called, testcases must be greater than 0**
