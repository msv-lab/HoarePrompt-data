Output State: **`ops` will have been partially processed in reverse order, with the current tuple being the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`; `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) excluding `v1`; `v1` is an integer equal to len(vx) - 2; `v2` is an integer equal to len(vx) - 2.**

Explanation: The code removes `v1` from the set `vx`. Since `v1` is equal to `len(vx) - 2`, removing `v1` from `vx` will reduce the size of `vx` by 1. Consequently, both `v1` and `v2` are decremented by 1 because they are both derived from the length of `vx`.
