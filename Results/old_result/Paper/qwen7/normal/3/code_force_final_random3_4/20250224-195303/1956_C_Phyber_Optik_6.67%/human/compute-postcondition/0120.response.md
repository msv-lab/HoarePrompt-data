Output State: **`sum` is either `2 * sum + n * (n + 1) // 2` or `sum + (i + 1) * n`, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least `1`, `t` is an input integer representing the number of remaining iterations, `r` is either `i + 1` or `0` depending on whether the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > (i + 1) * n` is true or false, `i` is `i + 1`, `sum` is updated to `sum + i * n`**.

Explanation: The variable `sum` is updated by adding `i * n` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
