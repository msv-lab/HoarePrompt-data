### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program. The goal is to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously in the sky. The provided program uses the formula `m // a + m // b + 2` to calculate this, which is indeed incorrect as per the original assessment.

#### Analysis of the Formula:
- `m // a` gives the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period.
- `m // b` gives the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility period.
- Adding `2` accounts for the initial fireworks launched by each installation.

However, this formula does not correctly account for the overlapping intervals where fireworks from both installations might be visible at the same time. To find the correct solution, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.

#### Correct Approach:
1. Calculate the LCM of `a` and `b`.
2. Determine how many fireworks from each installation overlap during the visibility period.
3. Sum up the unique fireworks from both installations and the overlapping fireworks.

#### Example Verification:
Let's manually verify the correct solution for the case `7 8 56`:

- Fireworks from the first installation: `[56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112]`
- Fireworks from the second installation: `[56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112]`

The overlapping fireworks are `[56, 112]`. Therefore, the total number of unique fireworks visible at the same time is:
- From the first installation: 8 fireworks (including overlaps).
- From the second installation: 8 fireworks (including overlaps).
- Overlapping fireworks: 2 fireworks.

Thus, the correct maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is \(8 + 8 - 2 = 14\), not 17.

Given this analysis, the provided program is indeed incorrect because it does not correctly handle the overlapping intervals.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time due to the flawed logic.

**Final: False**
