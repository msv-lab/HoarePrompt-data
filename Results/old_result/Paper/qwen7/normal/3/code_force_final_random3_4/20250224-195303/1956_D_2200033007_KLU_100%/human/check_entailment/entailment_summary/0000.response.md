Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to ensure that the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs` collectively solve the problem as described. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

1. **Understanding `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to find the maximum possible sum of the array by performing operations. It uses dynamic programming to explore all possible ways to split the array into subarrays and compute the maximum sum.
   - The function uses memoization (`res_dict`) to avoid redundant calculations, which is crucial for efficiency.

2. **Understanding `func_2`**:
   - This function determines the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
   - It checks different conditions to determine how to modify the array to reach the maximum sum.
   - If the maximum sum equals the square of the length of the subarray, it constructs a "staircase" pattern, which is a valid operation.
   - Otherwise, it recursively finds the operations needed for the left and right subarrays.

3. **Understanding `make_stairs`**:
   - This function constructs the "staircase" pattern in the array.
   - It ensures that the subarray from `start_index` to `start_index + i` is modified to form a staircase pattern.
   - It updates the array and records the operations in `res`.

Given the problem constraints and the descriptions of the functions, let's verify the correctness:

- **Problem Constraints**: The problem allows up to \(5 \times 10^5\) operations, which is handled by the functions.
- **Dynamic Programming**: `func_1` correctly explores all possible ways to maximize the sum using dynamic programming.
- **Operations Construction**: `func_2` correctly identifies the necessary operations to achieve the maximum sum.
- **Staircase Pattern**: `make_stairs` correctly constructs the staircase pattern, which is a valid operation to maximize the sum.

Since all functions work together to solve the problem as described, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
