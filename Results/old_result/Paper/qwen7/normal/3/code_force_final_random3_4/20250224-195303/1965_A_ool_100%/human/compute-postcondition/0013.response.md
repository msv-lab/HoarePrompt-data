Output State: **`A` is True, `not_c` is False, `set_` must have at least 1 element, and `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `A = not A` changes the value of `A` from its previous state (which was `False`) to `True`. The other variables (`not_c`, `set_`, and `i`) remain unchanged according to the initial state provided.
