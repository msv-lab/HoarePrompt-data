Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 3.
- `n` is at least 7.
- `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- `count` is greater than 1.
- `done` is set to True.
- The most internal loop or if statement is broken out.
- The current value of `count2` is equal to `count`.

The print statement is simply:

```python

```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state.
