Output: **YES**

Explanation:
- The initial state provides that `j` is 1, `n` is 2, and `done` is set to True.
- The code snippet does not modify any variables or objects; it directly prints the string 'YES'.
- Since no conditions or operations are performed that would change the printed string, the output remains 'YES'.
