Postcondition: `prev` is equal to `curr`, `tree` contains the elements `s`, `curr`, and `curr` is either the first or the second element of `nodes[curr]` that is not equal to `e`. If `nodes[curr][0]` equals `prev`, then `curr` is the second element of `nodes[curr]` that is not equal to `e`; otherwise, `curr` is the first element of `nodes[curr]` that is not equal to `e`.
