Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains `_` (an underscore), which is used as a throwaway variable, and `int(input())` which reads an integer from the input.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` provides a positive integer value. Since the problem does not specify any constraints on the input other than it being an integer, we need to ensure that the input is a positive integer.

3. **Adjust the state accordingly**: We need to ensure that the input provided by `int(input())` is a positive integer. Given that the loop will run for each test case, we need to ensure that there is at least one test case to process.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that there is at least one positive integer input available for the loop to process.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and there must be at least one positive integer input available from `int(input())`**
