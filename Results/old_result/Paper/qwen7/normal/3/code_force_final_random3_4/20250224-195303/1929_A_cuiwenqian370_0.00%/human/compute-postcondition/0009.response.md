Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_arr` is a list containing the elements `arr[right]` and `arr[left]`, and `left` is not equal to `right`.**

Explanation: The code appends `arr[left]` to `new_arr`. Initially, `new_arr` contains only `arr[right]`. After executing `new_arr.append(arr[left])`, `new_arr` now contains both `arr[right]` and `arr[left]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
