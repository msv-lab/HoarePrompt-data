### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The game involves multiple piles of stones, and players take turns removing a positive integer \( k \) from each non-empty pile, where \( k \) is at most the size of the smallest non-empty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - We need to determine the winner if both players play optimally.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(a)**:
     - Removes duplicates and sorts the list.
     - Modifies the list such that each element starting from the second one is reduced by the corresponding element in a temporary list.
     - This transformation seems unnecessary for solving the game logic but is correctly implemented.
   - **func_2(a, n)**:
     - Determines the winner based on the number of piles and the initial configuration of stones.
     - Recursively checks if the starting player can force a win.
     - The base cases handle small numbers of piles directly.
     - For more than two piles, it recursively checks the next player's position and uses the result to decide the current player's outcome.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - The game can be analyzed using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes).
   - If the Nim-sum is zero, the second player wins; otherwise, the first player wins.
   - However, the provided functions do not use Nim-sum directly.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the game logic.
   - The recursive approach in `func_2` does not account for the actual game state and the optimal moves.
   - The transformation in `func_1` is unnecessary and does not affect the correctness of `func_2`.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions do not correctly solve the problem. The recursive function `func_2` does not accurately determine the winner based on the game rules.

### Response:
Correctness: **False**
