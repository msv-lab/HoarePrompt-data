Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `j` is equal to `count + 2`.
- `done` remains `True`.
- `count` is equal to `j`.
- `count2` is either `0` or greater than or equal to `count` (if `count` > 1).

The print statement is simply `print(2)`.

Given these conditions, the print statement will output the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
