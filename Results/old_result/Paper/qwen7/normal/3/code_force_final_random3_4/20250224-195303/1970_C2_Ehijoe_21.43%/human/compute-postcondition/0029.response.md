Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` nodes, `leaves` is a list containing the `key`, and `key` is the next key in the dictionary `nodes`.**

Explanation: The code appends the `key` to the `leaves` list. The `nodes` dictionary and its structure remain unchanged, and `key` remains the next key in the dictionary `nodes`. The `leaves` list now includes the newly appended `key`.
