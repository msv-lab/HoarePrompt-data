Based on the initial state provided:

- `ppp` is explicitly stated to be 23.
- `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to a tuple using `map` and `int` functions. However, the input string is not provided.
- `tc` is greater than 5 but is not relevant to the `print(l, r)` statement.

Since the input string is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `l` and `r`. Therefore, we will describe them in terms of the input.

Output: **(input1, input2)** (where input1 and input2 are the integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting it to integers)
