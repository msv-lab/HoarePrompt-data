Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether the logic used to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time aligns with the problem statement.

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem asks for the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. Fireworks launched by the first installation occur every \(a\) minutes, and those from the second installation occur every \(b\) minutes. Each firework is visible for \(m+1\) minutes.

2. **Key Insight**: The critical insight here is that the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time is determined by the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility window of the most recently launched firework from either installation.

3. **Calculation Logic**:
   - \(A = \left\lceil \frac{m}{a} \right\rceil + 1\): This represents the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility window of the most recent firework from the first installation.
   - \(B = \left\lceil \frac{m}{b} \right\rceil + 1\): This represents the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility window of the most recent firework from the second installation.

4. **Summing \(A\) and \(B\)**: The sum \(A + B\) gives the total number of fireworks visible at any given time because it accounts for the overlapping visibility periods of fireworks from both installations.

5. **Edge Cases**: The provided solution handles edge cases well, such as when \(a\) or \(b\) is equal to \(m\), ensuring the ceiling function correctly accounts for the additional firework.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

Correctness: **True**
