Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid. The variable `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between its previous value and `cnt + 1`. Since `cnt` is incremented by 1, `ans` is now the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt + 1`.
