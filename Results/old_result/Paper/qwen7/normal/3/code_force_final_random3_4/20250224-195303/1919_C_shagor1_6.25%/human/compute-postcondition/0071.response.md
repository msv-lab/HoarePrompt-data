Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the first element `a` of the non-empty list `inp` is less than or equal to `y`, `n` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n`, and `y` is `a`. If the condition `a <= y` is true, then `ans` remains as either 0 or 1. If the condition `a <= y` is false, then `ans` becomes 1.
