Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial conditions for `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 0 and `i` is still 0. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers input by the user.
