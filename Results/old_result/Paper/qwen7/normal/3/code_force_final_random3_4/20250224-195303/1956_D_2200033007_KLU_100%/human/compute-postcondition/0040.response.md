Output State: The loop will continue to execute until `j` reaches `start_index + i + 1`. After all iterations, `j` will be equal to `start_index + i + 1`, `arr[j-1]` (which is `arr[start_index + i]`) will be assigned the value `i`, and `start_index + i + 1` remains unchanged. All other variables (`is_already_stairs`, `arr`, `start_index`, `res`) remain in their initial or updated states from the last iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `j` will be `start_index + i + 1`, `arr[start_index + i]` will be set to `i`, and no other changes will have been made to the other variables.
