Output State: **`current_pair` is (a % x, a % y), `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` contains at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary with the key `current_pair` and value 1, `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `rx` is (-`a` % `x` + `x`) % `x`, `ry` is `a` % `y`, and `(current_pair, (rx, ry))` is not in `freq`.**

Explanation: The code `freq[current_pair] = 1` adds the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` as a key in the dictionary `freq` with a value of 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
