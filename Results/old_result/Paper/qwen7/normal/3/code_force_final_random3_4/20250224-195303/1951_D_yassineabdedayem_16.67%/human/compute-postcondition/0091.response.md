Output State: **`rep` is less than 60, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is `k - 2*Max`, `Min` is `min(n // (k - Max), k - Max)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / (k - Max)), k - Max)`, `number` is `Min`**.

Explanation: The code `k = k - Max` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `Max` from its current value. Since `Max` is defined as `max(int(n / k), k)`, after updating `k`, the new value of `Max` will be `max(int(n / (k - Max)), k - Max)`. Similarly, the new value of `Min` will be `min(n // (k - Max), k - Max)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
