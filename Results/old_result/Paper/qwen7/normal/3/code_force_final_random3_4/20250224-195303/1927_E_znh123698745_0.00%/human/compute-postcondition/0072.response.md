Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and \((-1)^i\) is equal to 1, `answer` has an additional element which is `array[a[0]]`.**

Explanation: The code `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the element `array[a[0]]` to the list `answer`. However, the initial values and conditions of `i`, `n`, and \((-1)^i\) remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 1, `n` must still be greater than 1, and \((-1)^i\) is still equal to 1. The only new information is that `answer` now contains an additional element, which is `array[a[0]]`.
