Output State: **`h1` is '09', `m1` is the string converted from the second input split by `:`, `time` is 'PM', and `h` is '21'.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string 'PM' to the variable `time`. This does not affect the values of `h1`, `m1`, or `h`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.
