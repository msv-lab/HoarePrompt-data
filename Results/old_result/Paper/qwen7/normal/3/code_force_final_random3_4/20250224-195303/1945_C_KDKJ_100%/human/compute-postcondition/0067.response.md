Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of houses and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. It calculates and prints the optimal index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i`, while ensuring that the number of residents preferring to live on the left side up to index `i` is at least half of those positions, and the number of residents preferring to live on the right side from index `i` to the end is also at least half of those positions.**
