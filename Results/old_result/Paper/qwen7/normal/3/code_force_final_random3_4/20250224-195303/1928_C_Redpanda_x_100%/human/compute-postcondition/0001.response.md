Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, each test case consists of two integers n and x such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, k is equal to the length of the list primes, 1 is yielded.**

Explanation: The code `yield 1` yields the value 1. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `k`, or the list `primes`. Therefore, the only change is that 1 is yielded.
