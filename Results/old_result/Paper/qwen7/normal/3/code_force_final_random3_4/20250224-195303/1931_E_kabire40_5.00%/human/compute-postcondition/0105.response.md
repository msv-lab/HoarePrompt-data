Postcondition: **The final value of `rev_res` will be the sum of all integers in `rev_val` plus the concatenation of the integer value of `rev_val[x]` (if `x` is even) or the reversed integer value of `rev_val[x]` (if `x is odd) for each iteration from `x = 0` to `x = len(rev_val) - 1`. Additionally, the value of `rev_res` is greater than 10 raised to the power of `max_power`**.
