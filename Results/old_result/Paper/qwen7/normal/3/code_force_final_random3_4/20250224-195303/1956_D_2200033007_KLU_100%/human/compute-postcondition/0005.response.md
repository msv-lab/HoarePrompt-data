Postcondition: **`is_already_stairs` remains True, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `res` is a list that will store the operations performed, `j` is 0, `i` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 17, and the value of `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`.**
