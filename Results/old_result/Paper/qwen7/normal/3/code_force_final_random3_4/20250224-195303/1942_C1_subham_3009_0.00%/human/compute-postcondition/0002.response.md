Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t > 0`.
2. **Current state**: The current state is that `t` is an input integer.
3. **Determine necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `t > 0` must be true. Since `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` itself. Specifically, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the modified state right before the loop should be:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
