Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(q, x)` is designed to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It correctly calculates the square root of `q` and checks if it is an integer. If it is, it adds this value to the list `M` if it is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It then iterates through all integers from 1 to the integer part of the square root of `q`, checking if they are divisors of `q` and if they are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, it adds them to the list `M`.

2. **Main Program Analysis**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `x`.
   - It calculates `y = n + x` and checks if `y` is even.
     - If `y` is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case.
     - If `y` is even, it calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` to get a list of possible `k` values.
     - It then checks if `n >= 3 * x - 2` and, if true, adds the results of `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to the list.
     - It converts the list to a set to remove duplicates and prints the length of the resulting list.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct for finding all divisors of `q` that meet the criteria.
   - The main program correctly uses the results of `func_1` to determine the possible values of `k` based on the conditions provided.
   - The overall approach to solving the problem is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
