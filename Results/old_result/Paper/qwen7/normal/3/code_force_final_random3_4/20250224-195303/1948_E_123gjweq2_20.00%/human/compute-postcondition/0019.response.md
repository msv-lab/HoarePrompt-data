Output State: **`i` is `not_mid`; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `clique`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `big_element - i`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `arr[left + mid + i]` to `big_element - i`. The values of `i`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]`, and `arr[left + mid + i]` are updated according to the given expressions. The other variables remain in their initial or unchanged states.
