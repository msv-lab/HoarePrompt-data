### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the given problem statement, along with the annotated code and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to find the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
- The cost of one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The promotion allows buying two yogurts for `b` burles.
- If `n` is odd, we must buy the remaining yogurt at the regular price.
- If `n` is even and `2 * a < b`, it is cheaper to buy all yogurts individually.
- Otherwise, we should take advantage of the promotion as much as possible.

#### Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
```

#### Annotated Code Explanation:
- The function processes each test case independently.
- It correctly handles the case where `n` is odd and the promotion is not beneficial.
- It correctly handles the case where `n` is even and the promotion is not beneficial.
- However, it fails to handle the case where `n` is even and the promotion is beneficial but the program does not fully utilize the promotion.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment claims the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `n` is even and `2 * a < b`.
- This claim is partially correct but incomplete. Let's verify the logic in detail.

#### Detailed Verification:
1. **Case 1: `n` is odd**
   - If `n % 2` is true, the program checks if `2 * a < b`.
     - If `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n` (buying all yogurts individually).
     - If `2 * a >= b`, it prints `n // 2 * b + a` (buying pairs at the promotion price and the last one individually).

2. **Case 2: `n` is even**
   - If `n % 2` is false, the program checks if `2 * a < b`.
     - If `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n` (buying all yogurts individually).
     - If `2 * a >= b`, it prints `n // 2 * b` (buying pairs at the promotion price).

#### Example Verification:
- **Input:** `4 5 10`
  - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 10`
  - Since `n` is even and `2 * a (10) >= b (10)`, the program prints `4 // 2 * 10 = 20` (correct).
- **Input:** `4 5 8`
  - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 8`
  - Since `n` is even and `2 * a (10) > b (8)`, the program prints `4 // 2 * 8 = 16` (incorrect according to the problem statement, but the program is correct here).

The program correctly handles the cases where `n` is odd and when `2 * a < b` for even `n`. The issue lies in the case where `n` is even and `2 * a >= b`, but the program does not fully utilize the promotion.

However, upon closer inspection, the program does indeed handle the case where `n` is even and `2 * a >= b` correctly. The program prints `n // 2 * b` which is the correct approach.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the program correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
