Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a set of test cases where each case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) with `k` being even. It returns a result based on these inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific integer values `t`, `n`, and `k`, and produce a result for each case based on the given constraints.
