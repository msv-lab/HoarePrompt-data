You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1

                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the total number of cases entered by the user, `i` is the last index processed by the loop (ranging from 1 to `n_cases`), `n` is the integer input from the user for the current case, and `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `n`. If `n` equals 1, `power` is set to 4. Otherwise, if `power` equals `n`, it remains unchanged; otherwise, `power` is adjusted to be within the range `[log2(n) - 1, log2(n))`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n_cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Handling Single Element Array:**
   - If `n` is 1, the program prints 1. This is correct because with only one element, the array is `[1]`, and no swaps will change the position of 1.

3. **Finding the Largest Power of 2 Less Than or Equal to `n`:**
   - The program calculates `power` as the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` using the following logic:
     - It initializes `power` to 1.
     - It increments `power` until `power` is greater than or equal to `log2(n)`.
     - It then checks if `power` equals `n`. If so, it prints \(2^n\).
     - Otherwise, it decrements `power` by 1 and prints \(2^{power}\).

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding the Position of 1:**
   - The problem requires finding the position of 1 after performing the specified swaps.
   - The current implementation does not correctly simulate the swapping process.
   - Instead of simulating the swaps, the program attempts to find a power of 2, which is unrelated to the actual problem.

2. **Incorrect Output for Larger `n`:**
   - For example, consider `n = 120240229`. The program should simulate the swaps and determine the final position of 1, but it incorrectly prints \(2^{24} = 16777216\) instead of the correct position.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to simulate the swapping process as described:

1. **Identify the Largest Divisor `d` for Each `k`:**
   - For each `k` from 2 to `n`, find the largest divisor `d` of `k` that is not equal to `k` itself.
   - Swap `a_d` and `a_k`.

2. **Track the Position of 1:**
   - Keep track of the position of 1 as the swaps occur.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            a = list(range(1, n + 1))
            pos_of_1 = 1
            for k in range(2, n + 1):
                d = k // 2 if k % 2 == 0 else (k - 1) // 2 * 2
                if d != k:
                    a[pos_of_1 - 1], a[k - 1] = a[k - 1], a[pos_of_1 - 1]
                    pos_of_1 = k
            print(pos_of_1)

func()
```

The original program is incorrect because it does not simulate the swapping process correctly. Therefore, the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
