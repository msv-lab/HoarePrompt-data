Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all possible cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to produce the lexicographically smallest word for certain inputs. For instance, consider the input `55`. According to the problem description, the lexicographically smallest word that encodes to `55` should be `"czz"`, but the program outputs `"azz"` instead. This happens because the program logic does not correctly distribute the remaining value after assigning the maximum possible values to the last two characters.
