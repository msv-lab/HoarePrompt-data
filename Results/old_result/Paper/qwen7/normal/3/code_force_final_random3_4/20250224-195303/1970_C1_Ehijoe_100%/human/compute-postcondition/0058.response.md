Output State: **`prev` is equal to `curr`, `tree` now contains the elements `s`, `curr`, and `curr` must be one of the elements in `nodes[curr]` that is not equal to `e` and is different from `prev`.**

Explanation: The code `tree.append(curr)` adds the value of `curr` to the list `tree`. Since `prev` was equal to `curr` before the append operation, this relationship still holds. The condition that `curr` must be one of the elements in `nodes[curr]` that is not equal to `e` and is different from `prev` also remains valid. Therefore, the updated state includes the new element in `tree` but keeps the other conditions intact.
