Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of its current value (which is `n`), and `cnt` if `a[i] == tmp`, otherwise `ans` remains the same; `n` is greater than 0; `cnt` is either 2 or 1; `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`; `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from input; `t` is `t - 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `a[i]` is either equal to `tmp` or not equal to `tmp`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is either 2 or 1, `ans` will be updated to `cnt` if `cnt` is smaller than the current value of `ans`. The value of `ans` will remain unchanged if `cnt` is greater than or equal to the current value of `ans`. All other variables (`n`, `tmp`, `aa`, `a`, `t`, `i`) are not affected by this line of code.
