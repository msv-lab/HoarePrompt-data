Output State: **`max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 1`, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is `x - 1`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 1)`, `current_sum` is `math.gcd(x, x - 1) + y**.

Explanation: The code sets `best_y` to the current value of `y`. Since `y` is defined as `x - 1`, `best_y` is also updated to `x - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
