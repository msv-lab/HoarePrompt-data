Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where no pair of friends can attend the party together. Specifically, consider the input:

```
3
3
2 3 1
```

In this case, if Monocarp sends invitations to friends 1 and 2, only friend 1 will attend because friend 2's best friend (friend 3) did not receive an invitation. Similarly, if Monocarp sends invitations to friends 2 and 3, only friend 2 will attend. If Monocarp sends invitations to friends 1 and 3, only friend 3 will attend. Therefore, no matter which two friends Monocarp invites, only one friend will attend the party.

The program incorrectly prints `2` in this scenario, but the correct output should be `3` because Monocarp needs to invite all three friends to ensure at least two friends attend the party. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for this specific case.
