Output State: **`i` is `l-1`, `x` is the maximum value found in the list `nums`, `y` is 100000000, `e` is `t`, `l` is an input integer.**

The code `l = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `l`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `x`, `y`, `e`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
