Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head defines the variables that control the loop execution. In this case, the loop is defined by `j` in the range `range(i + 1)`. Therefore, the only variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `i`.

2. **Determine the Current Values**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `is_already_stairs` remains `True` (this variable is not part of the loop head).
   - `arr` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`.
   - `start_index` is an integer such that `0 <= start_index < n`.
   - `res` is a list that will store the operations performed.
   - `j` is `0`.
   - `i` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `17`.
   - The value of `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from `0` and increases by `1` each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `0`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `i + 1`. For the next iteration, `j` needs to be `1` and `i` remains the same.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`is_already_stairs` remains True, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `res` is a list that will store the operations performed, `j` is 1, `i` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 17, and the value of `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`.**
