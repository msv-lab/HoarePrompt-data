Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, and the code simply updates the value of `t` without affecting the range constraint, the updated state is that `t` is now the input integer, which remains within the specified range.
