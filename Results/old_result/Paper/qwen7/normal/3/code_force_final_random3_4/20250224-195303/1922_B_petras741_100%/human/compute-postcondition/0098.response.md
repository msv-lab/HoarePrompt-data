Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(1, eta_ln):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `eta_ln`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `eta_ln` is not equal to 1. This means `eta_ln` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.
   - `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `eta_ln - 1`. Therefore, `j` should be initialized to 1.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1, we need to set `j` to 1.
   - `eta_ln` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `eta_ln` and `j`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`eta_ln` must be at least 2, `j` is 1**
