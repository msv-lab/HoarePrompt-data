Output State: **`j` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is greater than 1; `dp[i][j]` is calculated as the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the maximum of three expressions involving other elements of the `dp` table. However, the initial values and conditions for `j`, `n`, and the count of `j + 1` in `cards` remain unchanged. Therefore, these conditions and the value of `j` are preserved, while `dp[i][j]` is now determined by the given formula.
