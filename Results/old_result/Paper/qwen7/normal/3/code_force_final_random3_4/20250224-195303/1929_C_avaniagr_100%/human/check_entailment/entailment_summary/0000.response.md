Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic and compare it with the problem statement and the given examples.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Sasha can win or lose bets.
   - If he wins, his coins increase by \(y \cdot (k - 1)\).
   - If he loses, his coins decrease by \(y\).
   - He cannot lose more than \(x\) times in a row.
   - He starts with \(a\) coins.
   - We need to determine if he can eventually have at least \(n\) coins for any \(n\).

2. **Key Points from the Example**:
   - In the first test case, Sasha can achieve any number of coins using a specific betting strategy.
   - In the second test case, Sasha cannot achieve any number of coins due to the constraints.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads each test case and splits the input into \(k\), \(x\), and \(a\).
   - It then checks several conditions:
     - If \(x < k - 1\):
       - If \(a \geq x + 1\), it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
     - If \(x == k - 1\):
       - If \(a \geq x + 2\), it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
     - If \(x > k - 1\):
       - It calculates \(z = k - 2\) and iterates up to \(x - k + 3\) to update \(z\).
       - If \(a \geq z\), it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic in the program aligns with the problem statement and the examples provided.
   - The conditions for 'YES' and 'NO' are correctly derived from the problem constraints.
   - The program handles different scenarios appropriately based on the values of \(k\), \(x\), and \(a\).

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins.

Correctness: **True**
