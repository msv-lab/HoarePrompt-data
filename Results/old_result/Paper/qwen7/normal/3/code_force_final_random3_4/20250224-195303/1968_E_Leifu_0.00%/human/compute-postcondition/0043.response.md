Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `4` to `n` (inclusive), meaning `j` starts at `4` and increments by `1` until it reaches `n`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is that `n` must be at least `4`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Since `j` starts at `4` and increments by `1`, the loop will continue as long as `j < n + 1`.
   - After each iteration, `j` increases by `1`. Therefore, if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `k + 1` in the next iteration.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `n` must remain such that `j < n + 1` holds true.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `j` was `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration because the loop just finished running up to `n - 1`.
   - In the next iteration, `j` will be `n`.
   - Therefore, `n` must still be at least `4` for the loop to continue, but since `j` is now `n`, `n` can be any value greater than or equal to `4`.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` must be at least 4**.
