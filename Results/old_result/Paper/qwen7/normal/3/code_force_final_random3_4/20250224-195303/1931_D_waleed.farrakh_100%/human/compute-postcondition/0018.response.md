Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing three tuples, `idx` is `idx + 4`, `t` is `t - 2`, `arr` is a list of integers converted from `data[idx + 1].split()`**.

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list, making it contain three tuples instead of two. The values of `idx` and `t` are updated as specified, and `arr` remains unchanged but is now referenced within the context of the new tuple in `test_cases`.
