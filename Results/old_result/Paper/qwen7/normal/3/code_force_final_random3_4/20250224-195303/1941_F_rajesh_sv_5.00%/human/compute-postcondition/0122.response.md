Output State: **`mid` is assigned to `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `total` is undefined, `students` is undefined, `left` must be less than `right` plus `f`, and `l < h` must be true.**

Explanation: The variable `h` is assigned the value of `mid`. The values of `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `total`, `students`, `left`, and the condition `l < h` remain unchanged from the initial state.
