Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 1; `a[0]` is 1; `answer` has an element appended from `array[a[0]]`.**

Explanation: The value of `a[0]` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 (implied initial value since no other value was given) to 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
