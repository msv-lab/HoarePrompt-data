Output State: **`s` is a string input from the user, `mak` is undefined, `pans` is undefined, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is the same as before the previous iteration**.

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or states. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all previously printed output is actually displayed. Since no variables are assigned new values or affected by this command, the initial states of the variables remain unchanged.
