Output State: The value of `cntl[i]` for each index `i` in the list `a` will be incremented by the number of times the element `i` appears in the list `a`. All other variables (`c`, `j`, `n`, and `a`) will retain their final values from after the loop has completed its iterations. The variable `cntl` will be a list where each index corresponds to an element in `a`, and the value at each index represents how many times that particular element appeared in `a`.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the `cntl` list will show the frequency count of each element present in the list `a`. All other variables will stay as they were last updated within the loop or in the initial state.
