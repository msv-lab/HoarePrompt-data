The function processes an integer `t` where `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` where `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9`. It then prints either `(x, y)` or `(y, x)` based on whether `x` is less than `y`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any specific value but outputs pairs of integers based on the comparison condition.
