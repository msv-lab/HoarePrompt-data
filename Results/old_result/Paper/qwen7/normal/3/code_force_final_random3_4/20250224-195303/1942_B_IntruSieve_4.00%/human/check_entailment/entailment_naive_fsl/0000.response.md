Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). Specifically, the logic used to compute the MEX values and assign them to the permutation \( p \) is flawed.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this:

### Example:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  5
  1 1 -2 1 2
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  0 1 4 2 3
  ```

- Program Output:
  ```
  0 1 3 2 4
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **First Element:**
   - \( a_1 = 1 \)
   - The MEX of an empty set is 0.
   - So, \( p_1 \) should be 0.
   - The program correctly assigns \( p_1 = 0 \).

2. **Second Element:**
   - \( a_2 = 1 \)
   - The MEX of \([0]\) is 1.
   - So, \( p_2 \) should be 1.
   - The program correctly assigns \( p_2 = 1 \).

3. **Third Element:**
   - \( a_3 = -2 \)
   - The MEX of \([0, 1]\) is 2.
   - So, \( p_3 \) should be 4 (since \( 2 - 2 = 0 \), but 0 is already used, so we take the next available number which is 4).
   - The program incorrectly assigns \( p_3 = 3 \).

4. **Fourth Element:**
   - \( a_4 = 1 \)
   - The MEX of \([0, 1, 4]\) is 2.
   - So, \( p_4 \) should be 2.
   - The program correctly assigns \( p_4 = 2 \).

5. **Fifth Element:**
   - \( a_5 = 2 \)
   - The MEX of \([0, 1, 4, 2]\) is 3.
   - So, \( p_5 \) should be 3.
   - The program correctly assigns \( p_5 = 3 \).

From the above analysis, it is clear that the program does not correctly compute the MEX values and assign them to the permutation \( p \). Specifically, the assignment of \( p_3 \) is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for this case, making it incorrect.
