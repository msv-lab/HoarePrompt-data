Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `itm in mex`. This means the loop is iterating over the elements of the list `mex`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `mex` is a list containing all the values of `minn` updated during each iteration where `arr[i] > 0`, and the absolute differences between `arr[i]` and `minn` when `arr[i] <= 0`. The variable `itm` is the second element of `mex`.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, `itm` must be the next element in the list `mex`. Since `itm` is the second element in the current iteration, the next element in `mex` will be the third element.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to update the state such that `itm` becomes the third element of `mex`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `mex` is now a list with its third element as `itm`.
- `itm` is the third element of `mex`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`mex` is a list where the third element is `itm`, and `itm` is the third element of `mex`**.
