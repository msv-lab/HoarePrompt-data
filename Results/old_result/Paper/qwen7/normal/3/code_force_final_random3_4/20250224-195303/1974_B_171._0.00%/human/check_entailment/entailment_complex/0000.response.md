Reasoning:
1. The provided function `func_1` attempts to decode a string `encoded` that was previously encoded using a specific algorithm.
2. The function creates a mapping between characters in the original string `s` and their corresponding characters in the auxiliary string `r`.
3. For each character in `encoded`, the function checks if it has already been mapped. If not, it finds the next available character from 'a' to 'z' that hasn't been used yet and maps it.
4. However, the function does not correctly implement the decoding process. Instead of reversing the mapping created during the encoding phase, it simply assigns the next available character from 'a' to 'z' to any unmapped character in `encoded`. This means that the function does not actually decode the string but rather encodes it again with a different mapping.
5. Given that the function does not use the auxiliary string `r` to reverse the mapping, it cannot correctly decode the original string `s`.

Therefore, the function does not perform the required decoding operation correctly.

Correctness: **False**
