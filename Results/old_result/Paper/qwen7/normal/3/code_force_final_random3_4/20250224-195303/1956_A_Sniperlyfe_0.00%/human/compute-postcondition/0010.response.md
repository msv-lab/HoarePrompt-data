Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for n in qs:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `n` and `qs`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more elements in `qs` for `n` to iterate over.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` contains the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `n` and `p` retain their original values.

4. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `qs`, the value of `n` will change to the next element in `qs`.
   - The variable `p` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head and its value is retained from the outer scope.
   - The variable `res` will be updated based on the new value of `n` (the next element in `qs`) and the original value of `p`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `n` will be the next element in `qs` after the current one.
   - `p` retains its original value.
   - `res` will contain the result of `func_1(n, p)` for the new value of `n`.

Given the above steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`res` contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` where `n` is the next element in `qs`, and `p` retains its original value**.
