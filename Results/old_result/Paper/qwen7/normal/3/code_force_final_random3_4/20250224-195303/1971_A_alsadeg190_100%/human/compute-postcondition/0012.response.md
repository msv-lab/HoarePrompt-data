Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `i` is 1.
- `x` is the first integer from the input.
- `y` is the second integer from the input.

The `print(x, y)` statement will print the values of `x` and `y`.

Output: **x, y (where x is the first integer from the input and y is the second integer from the input)**
