Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least two elements, `x` is the first element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the first element of `operational_list`, and `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of the first element of `operational_list`.**

Explanation: The code appends the reversed string of the first element of `operational_list` (which is already reversed as an integer and stored in `x`) to the list `rev_val`. Since `x` is the reversed string of the first element of `operational_list` converted to an integer, `x[::-1]` would be the original string before reversal. This original string is appended to `rev_val`. The other variables remain unchanged.
