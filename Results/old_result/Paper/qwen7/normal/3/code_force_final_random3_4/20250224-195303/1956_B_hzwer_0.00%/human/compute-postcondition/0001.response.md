Output State: **`cards` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n represents the integers on the cards in your hand, where each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input using `input().split()`, and then converts each of these integers to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. These integers are collected into a list called `cards`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The list `cards` now contains the integers from the input, and the conditions regarding the range of `t`, `n`, and the structure of the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain valid.
