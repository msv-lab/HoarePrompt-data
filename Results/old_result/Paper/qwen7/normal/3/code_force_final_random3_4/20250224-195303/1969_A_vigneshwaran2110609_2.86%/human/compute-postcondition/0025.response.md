Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be the same as before, `x` is an input integer, `l[0] - 1` is equal to `l[0] - 1`, `flag` is True**.

Explanation: The code `x = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `x`. The values of `i`, `n`, `l[0] - 1`, and `flag` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `x` is an integer obtained from user input.
