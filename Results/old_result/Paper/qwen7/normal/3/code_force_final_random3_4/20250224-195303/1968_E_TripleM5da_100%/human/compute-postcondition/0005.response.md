Based on the initial state provided, `i` is at least 3 and `n` is at least 3. This means that both `i` and `n` have values that are greater than or equal to 3. Since the exact values of `i` and `n` are not specified, we can only use the minimum possible value for each, which is 3, to determine the output.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i, i)
```

Given that `i` is at least 3, the most precise description of the value of `i` that we can use is 3 (since it's the smallest possible value).

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **3 3**
