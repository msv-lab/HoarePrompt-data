Postcondition: **`input_value` must be a positive integer, `l` and `r` are the integers obtained from the input, `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`, `s` is the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`. If `s` is equal to 1 or greater than `r`, or if `e >= r`, then `s` and `e` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `s` and `e` are updated according to the logic in the else part.**
