Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program checks if either `a` or `b` is even. However, this logic is incomplete and does not cover all cases where a new rectangle can be formed. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where both `a` and `b` are odd but greater than 1, which can still allow for the formation of a new rectangle.

For example, consider the input `2 6`. According to the problem description, Bob can cut the 2x6 rectangle into two 2x3 rectangles and then form a 4x3 rectangle. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Yes" for this case because `2 % 2 == 0`.

Another example is the input `3 3`. Although both dimensions are odd, the rectangle can still be cut into two 3x1 rectangles and then reformed into a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x3 rectangle. The program incorrectly outputs "No" for this case.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and hence is incorrect.
