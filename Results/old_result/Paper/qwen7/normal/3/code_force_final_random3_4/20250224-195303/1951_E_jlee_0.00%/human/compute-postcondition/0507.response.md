Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 4
- `n` is greater than 7
- `count` is 4
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then `done` is set to True and the loop or if statement is broken. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, the postcondition remains unchanged.

We need to determine what will be printed by the following code snippet:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `j` is explicitly given as 4.
2. `string` is not explicitly defined, but we know that the slicing operation `string[:j]` will take the substring from the start of `string` up to, but not including, the character at index `j` (which is 4).
3. Similarly, `string[j:]` will take the substring starting from index `j` (which is 4) to the end of the string.

Therefore, the print statement will output two substrings of `string`:
- The first substring is from the beginning of `string` to just before the 4th character.
- The second substring is from the 4th character to the end of `string`.

Since the exact content of `string` is not provided, we cannot give a precise numerical or textual output. However, we can describe it in terms of the slicing operations.

Output: **string[:4], string[4:]**
