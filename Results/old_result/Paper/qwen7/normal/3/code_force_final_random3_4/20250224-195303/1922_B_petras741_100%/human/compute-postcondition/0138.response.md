Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `range(n + 1)`, meaning `j` will take values from 0 to `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `q[j]` is greater than 0.
   - `eta` contains the index `j + 1` and now also contains `j`.
   - `q` is a list of integers.
   - `j + 1` is an index within the range of the list `q`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` is iterating through `range(n + 1)`, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was one less than its current value.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will increase by 1.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `q[j]` will now be `q[j + 1]` because `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - `eta` will contain `j + 2` (since it currently contains `j + 1` and `j`).
   - `j` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `q[j + 1]` is greater than 0; `eta` contains the index `j + 2` and now also contains `j + 1`; `q` is a list of integers, and `j + 2` is an index within the range of the list `q`.**
