To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `res` contains the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `n` and `p` retain their original values.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- `res` is a list (or iterable) that contains the result of the function call `func_1(n, p)`.
- `map(str, res)` applies the `str()` function to each element in `res`, converting each element to a string.
- `' '.join(...)` joins these string representations with a space as the separator.

### What Will Be Printed:

The `print` statement will output a single string where each element of `res` is converted to a string and then joined together with spaces between them.

Given the initial state, the exact content of `res` is not specified, but it is the result of `func_1(n, p)`. Therefore, the output will be a string representation of the elements in `res`, separated by spaces.

### Final Output:

Output: **a string of space-separated string representations of the elements in res**
