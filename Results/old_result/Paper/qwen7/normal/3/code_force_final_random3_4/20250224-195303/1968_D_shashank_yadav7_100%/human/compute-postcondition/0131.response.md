Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is -1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `s` is `p[s] - 1`
   - `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`
   - `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`
   - `sp` is `a[s] + sp`
   - `bp` is increased by `a[b]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is -1, increasing `i` by 1 will make `i` equal to 0.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

5. **New state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be 0 (since it was -1 and we increased it by 1).
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

So, the new state is:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
