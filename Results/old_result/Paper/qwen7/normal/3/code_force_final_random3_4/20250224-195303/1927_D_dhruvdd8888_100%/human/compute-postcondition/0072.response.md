Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `input_value` is a positive integer.
   - `l` is the first integer from the input split by space and converted to int.
   - `r` is the second integer from the input split by space and converted to int.
   - `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA` (though `LA` is not explicitly defined, it is implied to be `eli` since `eli` is the insertion point).
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.
   - After the assignment, `s` is the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`, and `e` is the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(s, e + 1)
   ```

Given the initial state, we need to determine the values of `s` and `e`:
- `s` is the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA` (which is `eli`).
- `e` is the second element of the tuple at the same index.

Since `arr` is sorted and `eli` is the leftmost insertion point of `(l, 0, 0)`, the tuple at index `eli` in `arr` is `(l, 0, 0)`.

Therefore:
- `s` is `l`.
- `e` is `0`.

So, the code snippet `print(s, e + 1)` will print:
- `s` which is `l`.
- `e + 1` which is `0 + 1 = 1`.

Output: **l 1**
