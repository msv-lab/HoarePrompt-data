#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b), a and b are positive integers representing the usual price and the modified price of the first k buns respectively, and n is a positive integer representing the total number of buns.
def func_1(k, a, b, n):
    ans = 0
    ans += k * b
    ans += (n - k) * a
    return ans <= n * max(a, b)
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the calculated cost `ans` (which is `k * b + (n - k) * a`) is less than or equal to the total cost if all buns were priced at the higher of the two prices `a` or `b`, i.e., `n * max(a, b)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n`. It calculates the total cost based on the given conditions and returns a boolean value indicating whether this calculated cost is less than or equal to the total cost if all buns were priced at the higher of the two prices `a` or `b`.
