Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `edges`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, or `start`. The value of `t` remains unchanged at 1. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `edges` as an empty list while keeping the initial values of `n` and `start` intact.
