Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx`, `res` is `res + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user, and the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
