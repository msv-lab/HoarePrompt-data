Output State: **`i` is `n + t`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` remains `False`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `n`, or `possible`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
