Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the game's final score based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
2. The provided program does not fully capture the game's rules and the optimal strategies for both players.
3. Specifically, the program only checks for the presence of the number 0 and the frequencies of other numbers up to \( n \), without considering the turns and the specific actions of Alice and Bob.
4. The program does not account for the fact that Alice can strategically pick elements to maximize the MEX of her resulting array \( c \), and Bob will try to minimize it.
5. The program also does not handle the alternating turns correctly, as it does not simulate the game properly.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
