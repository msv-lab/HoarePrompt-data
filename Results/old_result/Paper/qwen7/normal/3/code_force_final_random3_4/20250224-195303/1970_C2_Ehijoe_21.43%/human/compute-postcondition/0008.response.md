Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is 0
   - `u` is an input integer
   - `v` is an input integer
   - `nodes[v]` contains `[u]`

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: 
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 1 and `n` must be such that `i < n - 1`.

4. **Update the State**:
   - Since `i` was 0 and it needs to be incremented to 1 for the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 2 (since `i < n - 1` and `i` is now 1).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` is updated to 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.

6. **Output the Updated State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `u` remains an input integer.
   - `v` remains an input integer.
   - `nodes[v]` still contains `[u]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`i` is 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[v]` contains `[u]`**
