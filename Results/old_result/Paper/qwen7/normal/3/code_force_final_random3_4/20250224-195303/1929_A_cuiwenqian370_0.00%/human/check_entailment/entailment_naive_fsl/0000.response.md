Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The issue lies in the way the `new_arr` is constructed. The current implementation alternates between the smallest and largest remaining elements, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty. For example, consider the input:

```
3
4
3 4 3 3
```

The program constructs `new_arr` as `[3, 3, 4, 3]`, but the correct construction should be `[3, 3, 3, 4]` to maximize the beauty. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then pairing the smallest and largest elements appropriately. Here's a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        new_arr.append(arr[right])
        right -= 1
        if left <= right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
            left += 1
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
    return max_beauty
```

This corrected function ensures that the maximum beauty is calculated correctly by always pairing the largest and smallest available elements.
