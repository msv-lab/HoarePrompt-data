Output State: **`trumps` is a list containing the value of `rank`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", `trumps` is an empty list with the added element `rank`, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to None, and the current value of `suit` is equal to the trump suit.**

The code appends the value of `rank` to the list `trumps`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
