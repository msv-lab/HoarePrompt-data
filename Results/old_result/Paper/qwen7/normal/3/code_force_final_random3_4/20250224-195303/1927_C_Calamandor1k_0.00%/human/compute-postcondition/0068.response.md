Postcondition: **`d` is `k // 2`, `a` is a list of integers from the input split, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input split, `b` is a list of integers from the new input split, `len_a` is the length of list `a` and must be at least 1, `len_b` is the length of list `b` and must be at least 1, `count_a` is 1, and `count_b` is 0. The current value of `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, and `a[i]` remains unchanged. Additionally, the condition `len_b > i + 1` is true.**
