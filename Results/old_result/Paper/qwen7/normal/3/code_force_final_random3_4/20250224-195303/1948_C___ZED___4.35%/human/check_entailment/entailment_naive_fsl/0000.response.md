Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to check if the robot can reach the last column (2, n) from the first row. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
4
6
<>><>>
><<<>>
```

In this case, the robot starts at (1, 1). It can move to (1, 2) and then follow the arrow to (2, 2). From (2, 2), it can move to (2, 3) and then follow the arrow to (1, 3). This process continues until the robot reaches (1, 6) and then follows the arrow to (2, 6). Therefore, the robot can reach (2, 6).

However, the program incorrectly outputs 'NO' for this input because it only checks if the last character in the second row is '>' and if `n` is 1. Since `n` is not 1 and the last character in the second row is '<', the program incorrectly concludes that the robot cannot reach (2, n).

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the robot can reach the last column from the first row and then follow the arrows to reach (2, n).
