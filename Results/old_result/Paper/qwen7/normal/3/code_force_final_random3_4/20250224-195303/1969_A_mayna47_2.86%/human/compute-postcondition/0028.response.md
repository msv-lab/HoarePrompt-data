Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a list `p` of length `n` from the input. It then checks if there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i` for a constructed list `v`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and exits. If no such index exists, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value.**
