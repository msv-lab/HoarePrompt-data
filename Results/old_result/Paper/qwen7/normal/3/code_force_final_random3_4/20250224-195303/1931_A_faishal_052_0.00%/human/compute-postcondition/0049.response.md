Given the initial state where `k` is 2, we need to determine what will be printed by the `print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')` statement.

1. The value of `k` is explicitly given as 2.
2. We need to find the value of `arr[k]`, which means `arr[2]`.
3. Since the value of `arr[2]` is not explicitly provided, we cannot determine it precisely from the given information. However, we know that `chr(arr[k] + 96)` will convert the value of `arr[2]` to its corresponding character after adding 96 to it.

Let's assume `arr` is a list with elements such that `arr[2] = x`. Then the expression inside the `chr` function would be `x + 96`.

For example, if `arr[2] = 1`, then `x + 96 = 1 + 96 = 97`, and `chr(97)` would be `'a'`.

Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `arr[2]`.

Output: **chr(arr[2] + 96)**
