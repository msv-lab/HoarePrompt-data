Output State: **`t` is a positive integer less than its original value, `[n, x, y]` are strings representing integers entered by the user, `arr` is a list containing these strings.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input().split()` takes a single line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` are now represented as strings in the list `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain as they were before the execution of the code, except that `t` is now confirmed to be less than its original value due to the condition mentioned in the initial state.
