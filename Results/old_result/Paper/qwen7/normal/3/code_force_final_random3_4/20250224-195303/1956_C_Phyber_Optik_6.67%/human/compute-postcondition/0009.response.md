Output State: **`sum` is increased by `i * n`, `n` is an integer, `i` is an integer, and the expression `(n * (n + 1) // 2) <= i * n` holds true.**

Explanation: The variable `sum` is assigned the value of itself plus `i * n`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition `(n * (n + 1) // 2) <= i * n` still holds true.
