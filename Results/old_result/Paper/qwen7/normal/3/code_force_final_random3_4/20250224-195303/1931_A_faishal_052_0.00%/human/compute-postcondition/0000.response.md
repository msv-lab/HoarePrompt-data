Output State: **`cases` is an input integer and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.**

Explanation: The code `cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `cases`. The initial conditions for `t` and the range for `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 78\).
