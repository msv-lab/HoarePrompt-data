Postcondition: `nx` is a string, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the character at position `j` in `xx[i]` is either not `'?'` or `'?'`, and if either `i` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`, `nx` is updated to be the concatenation of its original value ('F' or 'S') and the character at position `j-1` in `xx[i]`.
