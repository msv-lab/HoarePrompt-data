Reasoning:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to find the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded. Let's break down why:

1. **Initial Assumption**: The code assumes that the value of `lex` will always be processed in a way that results in the smallest possible letters being chosen first. However, the logic inside the loop does not correctly handle different ranges of `lex` values to ensure the smallest possible letters are chosen.

2. **Range Handling**: The code checks if `lex` is less than or equal to 26 and greater than 26, but it doesn't handle the full range of possible values for `lex`. Specifically, it doesn't correctly break down the value of `lex` into its constituent parts representing the positions of the three letters.

3. **Incorrect Logic**: The current logic does not correctly compute the positions of the letters. It only appends fixed values (`1` or `26`) to the list `arr` without considering the actual value of `lex`.

4. **Output**: The final output is always `'abc'`, regardless of the input value of `lex`. This is incorrect because the lexicographically smallest word should vary depending on the value of `lex`.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
