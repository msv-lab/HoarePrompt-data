Output State: **`possible` is False, `i` is `n - 1 + t`, `c` is an input string from user input, and the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to the current value of `b[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no such context is provided, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The other variables retain their initial or given states.
