Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(t)`. The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `t` must be greater than 0.

3. **Update the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `t` must still be greater than 0.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `t`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3**
