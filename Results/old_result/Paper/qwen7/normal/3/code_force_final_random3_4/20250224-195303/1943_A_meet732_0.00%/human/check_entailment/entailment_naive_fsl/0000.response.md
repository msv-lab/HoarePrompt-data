Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the optimal game score. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob play optimally, and it does not handle the scenario where multiple elements can lead to different MEX values in an optimal play.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

The expected output is:
```
2
1
0
```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
0
0
0
```

This is incorrect because:
- In the first test case, the optimal strategy would result in `c = [1, 0]`, leading to a MEX of 2.
- In the second test case, the optimal strategy would result in `c = [3]`, leading to a MEX of 1.
- In the third test case, the optimal strategy would result in `c = []`, leading to a MEX of 0.

The program incorrectly handles the counting and deducing the MEX value, failing to account for the optimal moves of both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
