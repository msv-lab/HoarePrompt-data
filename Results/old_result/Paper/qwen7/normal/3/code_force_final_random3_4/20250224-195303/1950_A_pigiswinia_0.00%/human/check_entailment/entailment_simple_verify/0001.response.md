### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Digits**: For each test case, it correctly reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIRS' if this condition is met. This is correct according to the problem statement.
4. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met. However, there is a logical error in the condition. The correct condition should be `a < b and b > c` to ensure that `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`. The current condition `a < b > c` will always evaluate to `False` because `b > c` is not a valid comparison in this context.
5. **Default Case**: If neither condition is met, the program prints 'NONE'. This handles all other cases correctly.

Given that the program has a logical error in the peak condition check, it will not correctly identify peaks. For example, in the test case `3 4 1`, the program will incorrectly print 'NONE' instead of 'PEAK'.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect based on the provided problem description due to the logical error in the peak condition check.

### Final:
**False**
