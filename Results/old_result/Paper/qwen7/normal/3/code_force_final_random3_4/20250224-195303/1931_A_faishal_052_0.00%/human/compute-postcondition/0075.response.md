Output State: **`cases` is 3, `arr` is either `[1, 1]` or `[26, 1]`, `j` is 1 or 2, `lex` is an input integer - 1**

Explanation: The variable `lex` is decremented by 1. Since `lex` was initially an input integer, after executing `lex = lex - 1`, `lex` now holds the value that is one less than the original input integer. All other variables remain unchanged.
