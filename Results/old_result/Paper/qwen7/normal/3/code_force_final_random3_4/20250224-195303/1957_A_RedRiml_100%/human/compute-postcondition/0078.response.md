Postcondition: `d` is a dictionary and `pl` is a list. If the key `i` does not exist in dictionary `d`, then `d` is updated with the key `i` having a value of `1`. If the key `i` already exists in dictionary `d`, then the value of key `i` is incremented by `1`. The variable `i` remains the next element in `palka`.
