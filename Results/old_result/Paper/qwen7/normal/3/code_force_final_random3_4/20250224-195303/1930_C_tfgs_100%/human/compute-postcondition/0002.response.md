Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.
   - `n` is given as an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Initially, `i` is set to 0.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
