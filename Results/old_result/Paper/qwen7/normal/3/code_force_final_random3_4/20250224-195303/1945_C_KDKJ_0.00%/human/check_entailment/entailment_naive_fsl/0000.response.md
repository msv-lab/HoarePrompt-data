Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position for laying the road such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: For each test case, it calculates the prefix sums of zeros and ones using the `S` array. This helps in determining the number of zeros and ones to the left and right of any position `i`.
3. **Condition Check**: It iterates through each possible position `i` and checks if placing the road at that position satisfies the condition that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
4. **Optimization**: It keeps track of the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference from the center of the village (`n/2`).

Given the logic and the implementation, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. The provided examples and the general logic of the solution align with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
