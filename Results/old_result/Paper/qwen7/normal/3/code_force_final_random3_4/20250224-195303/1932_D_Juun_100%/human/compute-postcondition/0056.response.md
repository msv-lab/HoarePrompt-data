Based on the initial state provided:

- `rank` is unchanged, meaning it retains its previous value.
- `suit` is the next key in the `suits` dictionary.
- `trumps` is a list with one element less than before, implying that one element has been removed from the list.
- `answers` is a list with a new element `f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`.

The `print('IMPOSSIBLE')` statement directly prints the string `'IMPOSSIBLE'`.

Output: **IMPOSSIBLE**
