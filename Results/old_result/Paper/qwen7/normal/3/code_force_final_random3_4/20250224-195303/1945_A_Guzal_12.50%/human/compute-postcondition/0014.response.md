Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0 or 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `k` is either `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` if the condition `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0` is true, or `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` if `(b + c) % 3 != 0` is true and the condition is false.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, ensuring that the final state of the variables `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `k` is correctly described based on the given conditions.
