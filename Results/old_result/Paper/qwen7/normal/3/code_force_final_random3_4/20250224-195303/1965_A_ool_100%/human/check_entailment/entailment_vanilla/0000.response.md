### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles into an array `arr`.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1(arr)` to determine the winner based on the game rules.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Step 1**: Convert the array `arr` to a set and sort it to get unique pile sizes in ascending order.
   - **Step 2**: Check if the smallest pile size is 1. If not, return "Alice" because Alice can immediately remove all stones in one turn.
   - **Step 3**: Iterate through the sorted unique pile sizes to check if the difference between consecutive pile sizes is exactly 1. If any difference is greater than 1, set `not_c` to `False`.
   - **Step 4**: Use a boolean variable `A` to toggle between `True` and `False` for each pile size. If `not_c` is `True`, toggle `A` one last time.
   - **Step 5**: Return "Alice" if `A` is `True`, otherwise return "Bob".

4. **Game Logic**:
   - The logic implemented in `func_1` is based on the Sprague-Grundy theorem, which states that for a Nim-like game with multiple piles, the Grundy number (or nimber) of a position is the minimum excludant (mex) of the Grundy numbers of the positions reachable from it.
   - For this specific game, the Grundy number of a pile of size `k` is `k % 2`. When all piles have the same Grundy number, the second player wins; otherwise, the first player wins.
   - The function correctly implements this logic by checking if the smallest pile size is 1 and then toggling a boolean flag based on the differences between pile sizes.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where the smallest pile size is not 1 by immediately returning "Alice".
   - The function also correctly handles cases where the differences between pile sizes are not consistent, ensuring the correct winner is determined.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the game rules and the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
