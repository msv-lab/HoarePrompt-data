Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ppp` is explicitly given as 23.
   - `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to a tuple using `map` and `int` functions. However, the specific input is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values of `l` and `r`.
   - `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted into the list `arr` to keep it sorted. This means `eli` is determined by the sorted position of `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr`.
   - `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from `arr[min(eli, LA)]`. Here, `LA` is not defined, but assuming it is an index or a length of the list, `min(eli, LA)` determines the index from which `s`, `e`, and `_` are taken.
   - The current value of `s` is not equal to 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(s - 1, s)
   ```

Given the information:
- Since `s` is not equal to 1, let's denote the value of `s` as `x` where `x ≠ 1`.
- Therefore, `s - 1` would be `x - 1`.

The print statement will output the values `x - 1` and `x`.

Output: **x - 1, x (where x is the value of s and x ≠ 1)**
