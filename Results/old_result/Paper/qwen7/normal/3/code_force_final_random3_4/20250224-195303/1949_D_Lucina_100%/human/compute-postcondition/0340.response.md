Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This variable is being incremented in the loop.
   - `n`: This is a constant or a variable that determines the range of the loop.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each value of `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is such that `nx` is a string constructed based on the values in the 2D list `xx` from the row indexed by `i` and the columns indexed by `range(1, n+1)`. This means that `nx` is updated with the values from the current row `i` and columns `1` to `n`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

5. **Construct the New State**: Given that `i` was previously `i` (let's call it `i_prev`), the new value of `i` will be `i_prev + 1`. The value of `nx` will be updated based on the new row index `i_prev + 1`.

Since the only variables that change within the loop head are `i` and `n`, and `n` does not change, we only need to update `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`nx` is a string constructed based on the values in the 2D list `xx` from the row indexed by `i + 1` and the columns indexed by `range(1, n+1)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same as before**.
