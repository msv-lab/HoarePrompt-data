Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable directly involved in the loop head is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition given is:
   - `ppp` is 23.
   - `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to a tuple using `map` and `int` functions.
   - `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to keep the list `arr` sorted.
   - `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from either `arr[min(eli, LA)]` or `arr[max(eli, LA)]` depending on the condition `s > l`.
   - If `e` is less than `N`, the condition remains unchanged.
   - If `e` is greater than or equal to `N`, the condition also remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration State**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the value of `int(input())` will determine how many times the loop runs.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `int(input())` must be decremented by 1 from its current value.

Given the above points, let's assume that the input provided for the next iteration is `x`. The state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `ppp` remains 23.
- `l` and `r` remain the same as they were in the previous iteration.
- `eli` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
- `s`, `e`, and `_` will be reassigned based on the new value of `int(input())`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`ppp` is 23, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to a tuple using map and int functions, `eli` is the index where (l, 0, 0) would be inserted to keep the list `arr` sorted, `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from either `arr[min(eli, LA)]` or `arr[max(eli, LA)]` depending on the condition `s > l`, and `int(input())` is decremented by 1 from its current value.**
