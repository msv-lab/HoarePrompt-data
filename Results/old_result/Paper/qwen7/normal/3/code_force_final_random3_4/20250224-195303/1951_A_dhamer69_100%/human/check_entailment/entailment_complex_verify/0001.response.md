### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function is correct based on the problem description:

1. **Getting the Current Working Directory:**
   - The function correctly uses `os.getcwd()` to get the current working directory. This step is necessary to identify the relevant subdirectories.

2. **Listing Subdirectories:**
   - The function uses `os.scandir()` to list all subdirectories in the current directory. This ensures that only subdirectories are considered, not other types of files.

3. **Filtering Subdirectories:**
   - The function filters the subdirectories to include only those whose names are digits and fall within the specified range (`start` to `end`). This is done using `if folder_name.isdigit() and start <= int(folder_name) <= end`.

4. **Listing `.html` Files:**
   - For each qualifying subdirectory, the function lists all `.html` files using `os.listdir(folder)` and filters them with `if f.endswith('.html')`.

5. **Printing the Number of `.html` Files:**
   - The function prints the number of `.html` files found in each subdirectory using `print(f"Folder '{folder}' contains {len(html_files)} HTML files.")`.

6. **Generating Corresponding Python Files:**
   - For each `.html` file in the subdirectory, the function creates two new Python files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) using `open(ac_file, 'w').close()` and `open(wa_file, 'w').close()`. These files are then printed with their paths using `print(f"Generated files: {ac_file}, {wa_file}")`.

7. **Handling Valid Inputs:**
   - The function assumes valid inputs, which means the `start` and `end` parameters are valid directory names without leading zeros and the directory structure is consistent.

### Conclusion:

The `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Each step in the function is logically sound and performs the intended operations.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program `generate_files_for_html_in_range` is correct based on the problem description.
