Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). Additionally, the sum of `n^2` across all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5. For each test case, the function performs some operation based on the values of `t` and `n`.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates through multiple test cases, processing each one according to the specified conditions, but the exact operations within the function are not detailed here.
