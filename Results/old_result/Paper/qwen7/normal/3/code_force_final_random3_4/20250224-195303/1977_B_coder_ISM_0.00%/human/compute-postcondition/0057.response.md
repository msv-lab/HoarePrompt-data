Output State: **`flag` is an integer, `i` is 29, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1'.**

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '1'` changes the character at index `i` of string `s` to '1'. This change is independent of the value of `flag`. Since `i` is 29, the character at index 29 of string `s` is now '1'. The value of `flag` remains unchanged, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is now '1'.
