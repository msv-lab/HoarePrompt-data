Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `l < h`. This means the loop will continue as long as `l` is less than `h`.

2. **Variables Involved in the Loop Head**:
   - `l`: The lower bound.
   - `h`: The upper bound.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`.
   - `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`.
   - `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.
   - If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `h` is set to `mid`.

4. **Objective**: To determine which states need to be adjusted so that the loop can execute one more time.

### Current States:
- `l` is the lower bound.
- `h` is the upper bound.
- `mid` is the value of `l + (h - l) // 2`.
- `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`.
- `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
- The loop continues as long as `l < h`.
- Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than `h`.

### Adjusting the States:
- Since the loop condition is `l < h`, the only variables involved in this condition are `l` and `h`.
- We need to ensure that `l` is still less than `h` for the loop to execute one more time.

### Conclusion:
- No adjustments are necessary to `mid`, `mid_sum`, or `mid_next_sum` because they are not part of the loop condition.
- We need to ensure that `l` is less than `h`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`l` is the lower bound, `h` is the upper bound, and `l` must be less than `h`**.
