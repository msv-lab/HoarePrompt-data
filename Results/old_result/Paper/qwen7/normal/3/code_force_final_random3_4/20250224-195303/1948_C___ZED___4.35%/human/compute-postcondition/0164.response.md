Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` retains its original value, and both `a` and `b` remain as the strings input by the user. If `n` equals 1, then `k` is set to `n-2` (which is -1) and `no_path` is set to `False`. Otherwise, `k` retains its original value, `no_path` remains `False`, and `n` retains its original value.
