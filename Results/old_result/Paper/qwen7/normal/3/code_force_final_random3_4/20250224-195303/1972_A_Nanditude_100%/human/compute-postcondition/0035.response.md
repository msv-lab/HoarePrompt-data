Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

3. **Initial States**:
   - `cnt` is 0.
   - `t` is a positive integer that can be incremented.
   - `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.
   - `b` is a list of integers entered by the user via `map(int, input().split())`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is `n-1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `j` starts at `n-1` and the loop condition is `j < n`, the loop will execute exactly once (when `j` becomes `n-1`).
   - Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to `n-1` to ensure the loop executes once.

5. **Final State**:
   - `cnt` remains 0.
   - `t` remains a positive integer that can be incremented.
   - `a` remains a list of integers entered by the user.
   - `b` remains a list of integers entered by the user via `map(int, input().split())`.
   - `i` remains 0.
   - `j` must be `n-1`.
   - `n` remains an input integer.

Based on this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `j` being `n-1`.

**State:**
**`cnt` is 0, `t` is a positive integer that can be incremented, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `b` is a list of integers entered by the user via `map(int, input().split())`, `i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer.**
