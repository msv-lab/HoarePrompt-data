Given the initial state, `mak` is either 1 or 2, and `i` is 3. The `pans` list is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to assume its structure based on how it's being referenced in the print statement.

The print statement references `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]`. Since `i` is 3, `pans[i]` refers to `pans[3]`. The value of `pans[mak]` will depend on the value of `mak`, which is either 1 or 2. Therefore, `pans[mak]` will refer to `pans[1]` if `mak` is 1, and `pans[2]` if `mak` is 2.

The print statement will output a string with these values repeated twice. 

Output: **'? [pans[1]] [pans[1]] [pans[3]] [pans[3]]' (where [pans[1]] is the first element of the pans list, [pans[2]] is the second element of the pans list, and [pans[3]] is the third element of the pans list)**
