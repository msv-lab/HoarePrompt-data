Output State: `input_value` must be a positive integer, `n` is the converted integer value of the first split value from input, `k` is the converted integer value of the second split value from input, `pb` is now the final value obtained after repeatedly applying `p[pb - 1]` three times, `ps` is the converted integer value of the fourth split value from input, `p` is a list containing `[a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]]`, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]` appended three times, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, and `vis[pb - 1]` is equal to 1, indicating that the node `pb - 1` has been visited, and the loop breaks because `vis[pb - 1]` is already 1.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `pb` will hold the value it reaches after three steps of following the `p` list, `pathb` will contain the sequence of nodes visited up to the third step, and the visiting status of `pb - 1` will be marked as visited in the `vis` list.
