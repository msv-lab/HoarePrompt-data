Postcondition: `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least one element, `x` is the first element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the first element of `operational_list`, and the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`.
