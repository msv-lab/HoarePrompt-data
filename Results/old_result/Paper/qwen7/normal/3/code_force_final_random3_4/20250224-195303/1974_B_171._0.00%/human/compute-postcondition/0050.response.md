Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `c`, which is iterating over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `c` is within the specified range. This means `c` will take values from the ASCII value of 'a' to the ASCII value of 'z'.

3. **Determine the initial state of `c`**: Since the loop starts with `c` iterating from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`, the initial value of `c` should be `ord('a')`.

4. **Adjust the states**: The only variable in the loop head is `c`, so we need to ensure that `c` starts with the value `ord('a')`.

Given the initial state:
- `encoded` is a non-empty string (two characters shorter) consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length \( n \) satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 - 2 \).
- `decoded` is a list where each character in the original `encoded` string, except the first two, has been appended to according to the `mapping`.

Since these states do not affect the loop execution directly, they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `c` starting with the value `ord('a')`.

**State:**
**`c` is `ord('a')`**
