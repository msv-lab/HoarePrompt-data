Output: **n * a (where n is the first integer input and a is the second integer input)**

Explanation:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), but this variable does not affect the print statement.
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `a` is the second integer input.
- `b` is the third integer input and it is mentioned that the current value of `b` is less than or equal to `a`, but this information is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement `print(n * a)` will output the product of `n` and `a`. Therefore, the output is **n * a**, where `n` is the first integer input and `a` is the second integer input.
