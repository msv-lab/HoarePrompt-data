Output State: **The value of `i` is `n-1`; for every index `j` in the list `a`, the value of `a[j]` is `2j + 1`; `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `counter = Counter(a)` creates a `Counter` object named `counter` that counts the occurrences of each element in the list `a`. The values of `i` and the list `a` remain unchanged from their initial state. Each element `a[j]` in the list `a` is `2j + 1`, where `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`.
