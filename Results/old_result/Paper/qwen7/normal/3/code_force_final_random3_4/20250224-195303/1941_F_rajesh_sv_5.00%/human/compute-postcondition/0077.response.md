Output State: **`f` is the next value in the sequence defined by `F`, `l` is the index obtained by bisecting the list `D` with the value `left - f`, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `left - f` must be less than `right - f`, and `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`.**

This means that the variable `mid` has been updated to the value of `l + (h - l) // 2`, while the values of `f`, `l`, and `h` remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition `left - f` must be less than `right - f` also remains valid.
