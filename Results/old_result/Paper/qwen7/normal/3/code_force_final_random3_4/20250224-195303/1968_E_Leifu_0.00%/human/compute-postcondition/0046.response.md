Based on the initial state provided, `n` must be at least 5. However, the value of `j` is not explicitly mentioned. Since no value is given for `j`, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, the output will include the value of `j` printed twice.

Output: **j j (where j is an unspecified value that must be at least 5)**
