Output State: **`count_b` is 2, `i` is 2, and `b[2]` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `count_b += 1` increments the value of `count_b` by 1. Given that `count_b` was initially 1, after executing this line, `count_b` becomes 2. The values of `i` and `b[2]` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
