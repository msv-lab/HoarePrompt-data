Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variables `i`, `n`, and the range function. The variable `i` is the loop counter, and it ranges from `1` to `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, the initial value of `i` should be set to `1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. Therefore, `i` must be less than or equal to `n + 1` for the loop to execute.

4. **Check Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `b`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect the loop execution based on the given information.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is initially set to `1` and `i` remains less than or equal to `n + 1` throughout the loop execution.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `i` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`**
