Postcondition: `ppp` is 23, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `eli` is the index where (l, 0, 0) would be inserted to keep the list `arr` sorted, `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from either `arr[min(eli, LA)]` or `arr[max(eli, LA)]` depending on the condition `s > l`. This assignment is done regardless of whether `s == 1` or not.
