Output State: **`mak` is `i`, `mak2` is `n - 1`, `i` is `len(pans) + 2`, `pans` has all indices where the input was `<` and possibly `n` if the input was `=`, `s` contains the final input string received, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2, and `len(pans)` is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The line `mak = i` updates the value of `mak` to be equal to the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
