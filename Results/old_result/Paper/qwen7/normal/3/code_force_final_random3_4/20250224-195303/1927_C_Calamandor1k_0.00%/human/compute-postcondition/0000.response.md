Output State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`) remain in their initial state.**

This means that the variable `t` now holds the integer value entered by the user, constrained between 1 and 10^4, while all other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`) retain their initial conditions as described in the initial state.
