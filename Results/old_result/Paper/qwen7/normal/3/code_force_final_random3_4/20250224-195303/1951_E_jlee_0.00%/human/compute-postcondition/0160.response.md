Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is 2, and `done` is set to True.**

The code `done = True` does not affect the values of `j`, `n`, or `done`. It only sets `done` to `True`, which was already its value in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged, and `done` remains `True`.
