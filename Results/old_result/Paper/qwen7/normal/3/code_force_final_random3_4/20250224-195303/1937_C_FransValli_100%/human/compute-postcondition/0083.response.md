Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, meaning `i` will decrement from `n-1` to `1`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n-1`, we need to ensure that `i` is at least `1` for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `n` should be such that `n-1` is at least `1`.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` such that `n-1` is at least `1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `maxi` is 0, and `res` is the input string from the user, `n` must be greater than 1**
