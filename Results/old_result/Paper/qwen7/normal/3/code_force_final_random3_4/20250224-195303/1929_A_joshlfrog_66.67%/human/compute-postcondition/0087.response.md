Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `l` remains unchanged, `x` is `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than `y`, otherwise `x` remains `100000000`, `y` is updated to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than `y`, `e` remains `t`, and `l` is an input integer, with `nums` being a list of integers created from user input.
