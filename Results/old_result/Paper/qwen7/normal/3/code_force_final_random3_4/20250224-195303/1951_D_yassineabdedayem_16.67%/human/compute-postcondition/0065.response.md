Postcondition: `rep` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the input, `k` is the integer value of the second space-separated token from the input, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. The current value of `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`.
