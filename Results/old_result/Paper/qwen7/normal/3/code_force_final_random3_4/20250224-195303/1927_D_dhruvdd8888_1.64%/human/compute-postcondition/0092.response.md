Based on the initial state provided:

- `ppp` is explicitly given as 23.
- `l` and `r` are integers obtained from input and converted to integers.
- `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted into `arr` to keep it sorted.
- `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned values from either `arr[min(eli, LA)]` or `arr[max(eli, LA)]` depending on the condition `s > l`.

However, the specific values of `l`, `r`, `arr`, `LA`, and the exact logic for determining `eli`, `s`, `e`, and `_` are not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values of `s`, `e`, and `_` or the indices involved.

Given this, the print statement `print(-1, -1)` will simply output the literal values `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
