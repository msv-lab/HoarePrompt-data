Output State: **`ans` is increased by `i`, `y` is decreased by `i - 1`, `i` is the next element in `tmp` after `i_end`.**

Explanation: The code `y -= i - 1` decreases the value of `y` by `i - 1`. The other variables (`ans` and `i`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged. The value of `i` is updated to the next element in `tmp` after `i_end`, but since this update happens implicitly when the code is run, it is mentioned in the output state.
