Postcondition: `max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference or `-inf` if no other differences were found, `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred or `None` if no valid index was found, `i` is 5, and if `diff > next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff`.
