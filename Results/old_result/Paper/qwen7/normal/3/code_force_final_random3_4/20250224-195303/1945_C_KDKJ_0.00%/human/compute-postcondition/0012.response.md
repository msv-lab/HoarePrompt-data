Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1'; `S` is a list containing a sublist [x, y] where x and y are determined based on the last character of `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends a sublist `[x, y]` to the list `S`.
- The values of `x` and `y` are determined based on the last character of `a`:
  - If the last character of `a` is '0', then `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` remains unchanged.
  - If the last character of `a` is not '0', then the first character of `a` is set to '1' and `y` is incremented by 1 while `x` remains unchanged.
- The initial conditions of `a` remain unchanged except for the modifications described above.
- The list `S` now contains the sublist `[x, y]` reflecting the state of `x` and `y` based on the last character of `a`.
