Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **List `s`**: 
   - `s` contains 30 elements, each of which is determined by the result of a bitwise AND operation between `x` and \(2^i\), where \(i\) ranges from 0 to 29.
   - If `x & (2^i)` is greater than 0, the corresponding element in `s` is '1'; otherwise, it is '0'.
   - After the loop, `i` is 29, meaning the last element in `s` corresponds to \(2^{29}\).

2. **Value of `i`**:
   - `i` is set to 29 after the loop has executed all its iterations.

3. **Other Variables**:
   - `length` remains 30.
   - `t` and `nalla` retain their initial values since they are not affected by the loop.

Given these points, let's determine the contents of `s`:

- For each \(i\) from 0 to 28, the element in `s` will be '1' if `x & (2^i)` is greater than 0, and '0' otherwise.
- For \(i = 29\), the element in `s` will be '1' if `x & (2^{29})` is greater than 0, and '0' otherwise.

Since `i` starts from 0 and goes up to 29, the elements of `s` will be determined by the binary representation of `x`. Specifically, the \(i\)-th element of `s` will be '1' if the \(i\)-th bit of `x` is set (i.e., `x & (2^i)` > 0), and '0' otherwise.

Therefore, the list `s` will contain the binary representation of `x`, with the least significant bit (LSB) at the beginning and the most significant bit (MSB) at the end.

For example, if `x` is 1234 (binary: 10011010010), then `s` would be:
```
['0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0']
```

However, without the specific value of `x`, we cannot provide the exact sequence of '1's and '0's. But we know the structure of `s`.

Given the format requirement, the output will be the elements of `s` printed as a space-separated string.

Output: **0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 ... (30 elements in total, depending on the binary representation of `x`)**
