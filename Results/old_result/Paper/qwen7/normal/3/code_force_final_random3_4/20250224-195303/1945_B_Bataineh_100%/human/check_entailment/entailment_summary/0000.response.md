Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic used to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: If `m < a` and `m < b`, the program correctly prints `2`. This is because the first and second installations will launch fireworks such that no two fireworks from different installations overlap within the visibility period `m`.
   - **Case 2**: If `m < a` and `m > b`, the program prints `2 + m // b`. This means the first installation will launch fireworks every `a` minutes, but since `m < a`, only one firework from the first installation can be visible at any given time. The second installation, which has a shorter interval (`b`), will have multiple visible fireworks within the visibility period `m`.
   - **Case 3**: If `m < b` and `m > a`, the program prints `2 + m // a`. Similar to Case 2, but now the second installation has a longer interval, leading to multiple visible fireworks from the second installation.
   - **Case 4**: If `m >= a` and `m >= b`, the program prints `m // a + m // b + 2`. This accounts for the scenario where both installations have intervals shorter than or equal to `m`, leading to the possibility of multiple fireworks from both installations being visible simultaneously.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where `m` is smaller than either `a` or `b`, ensuring that the correct number of simultaneous visible fireworks is calculated.
   - The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` correctly accounts for the maximum number of fireworks from both installations overlapping within the visibility period `m`.

3. **General Logic**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the number of simultaneous visible fireworks based on the intervals `a` and `b` and the visibility period `m`.
   - The program uses integer division (`//`) to count the number of fireworks from each installation that can be visible simultaneously.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously based on the provided problem description and examples.

Correctness: **True**
