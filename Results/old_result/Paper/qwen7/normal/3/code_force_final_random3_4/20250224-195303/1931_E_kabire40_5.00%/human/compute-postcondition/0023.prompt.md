Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `y` is 0, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least one string; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the string `x`; if `len(str(x_rev))` equals `len(x)`, then `rev_res` is incremented by `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least two strings. If the length of the reverse of the string `x` (denoted as `str(x_rev)`) is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is updated by adding `x` to it, where `x` is the integer value of the reverse of the string `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of the string `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `operational_list` is a list of strings. If the length of the reversed and integer-converted first string (`x_rev`) is equal to the length of the original first string (`x`), then `rev_res` is incremented by `x_rev`. Otherwise, the reversed and integer-converted first string is appended to `rev_val`, and `rev_val` contains the reversed and integer-converted first string of `operational_list`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
