Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input, `i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `j` is -1, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `eta` is `[n - 2, n - 1]` if `n` is greater than 1 or `[0]` if `n` is 1, `eta_ln` is 1 if `n` is 1 or 2 if `n` is greater than 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`. The current value of `eta_ln` is 1.**
