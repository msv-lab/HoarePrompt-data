Output State: **`test_cases` is used to assign its i-th element to `n` and `arr`; `arr` is sorted; `median_index` is n // 2; `current_median` is arr[median_index]; `heap` is arr[median_index:]; `heap` is converted into a min-heap; `operations` is 2; `smallest` is the smallest element in `heap`; `heap[0]` is now `smallest + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value `smallest + 1` onto the heap. Since `smallest` is the smallest element in the heap, `smallest + 1` is the new smallest element. The operations count is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
