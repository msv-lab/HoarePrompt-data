Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the length of the list `S`, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[i][0] + S[i][1])`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `rsum` to be `n - lsum`. Initially, `lsum` was defined as `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`. After executing the line `rsum = n - lsum`, `rsum` now holds the value of `n - (S[i][0] + S[i][1])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
