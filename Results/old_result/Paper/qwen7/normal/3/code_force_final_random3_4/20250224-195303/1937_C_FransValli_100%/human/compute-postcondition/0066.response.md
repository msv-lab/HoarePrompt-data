Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `mini` is equal to the next `item` in `arr`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `arr` must have at least two elements.
   - `maxi` is still 3.
   - `res` is `'>'`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `mini` is the next `item` in `arr`.
- `item` is also the next `item` in `arr` because `mini` is set to the next `item` in `arr` and `i` is incremented by 1, implying that `mini` and `item` refer to the same element in `arr`.

Given that `arr` must have at least two elements, let's assume `arr` contains at least two elements. Since `mini` and `item` are referring to the same element in `arr`, they will have the same value.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
- `'?'` (a question mark).
- `mini` (the value of the next element in `arr`).
- `mini` again (the same value as the previous `mini`).
- `item` (the same value as `mini`).
- `item` again (the same value as the previous `mini`).

Output: **'? [mini] [mini] [item] [item]' (where mini and item refer to the same element in arr)**
