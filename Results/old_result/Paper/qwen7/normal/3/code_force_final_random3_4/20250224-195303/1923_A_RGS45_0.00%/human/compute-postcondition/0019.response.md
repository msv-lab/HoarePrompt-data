Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is the input integer from the user, `arr` is the new string input from the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before the index `n - y`, `arr` is the new string input from the user, `y` is updated to the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr`. This means that `y` is now updated to the index of the last '1' in the reversed `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
