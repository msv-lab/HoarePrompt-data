Output State: **`b` is a list, `k` is 3, `no_path` is False**

Explanation: The line `no_path = False` assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `no_path`. The initial values of `b` and `k` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be at least 3 is still a precondition that holds true.
