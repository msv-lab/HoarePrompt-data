Output State: **`j` is `i + 2`, `arr[j]` is assigned the value `i`, `start_index + i + 1` remains unchanged**

Explanation: The code `arr[j] = i` assigns the value of `i` to the element in the array `arr` at the index `j`. Given that `j` is `i + 2`, the value of `arr[i + 2]` is now `i`. The other variables (`j`, `arr[j]`, and `start_index + i + 1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
