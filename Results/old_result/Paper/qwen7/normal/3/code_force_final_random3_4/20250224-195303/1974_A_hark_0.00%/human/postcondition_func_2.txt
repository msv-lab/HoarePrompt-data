The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it calls another function `func_2()`, which processes two integers `x` and `y` (where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99). After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the variable `t` is an integer greater than 0.
