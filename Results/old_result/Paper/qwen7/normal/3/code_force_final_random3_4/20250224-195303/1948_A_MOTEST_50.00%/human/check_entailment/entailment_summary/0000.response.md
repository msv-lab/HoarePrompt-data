Reasoning:
- The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 1 by printing "NO".
- For even values of `n`, the program constructs a string consisting of pairs of distinct uppercase letters, which ensures that every character except the first and last will have exactly one neighbor that is the same, making them special.
- For odd values of `n`, the program starts with "AAA" and then constructs the rest of the string similarly to the even case, ensuring that the first three characters are special, and the remaining characters also follow the rule of having exactly one neighbor that is the same.
- The program constructs strings of length at most 200, as required.
- The logic for constructing the string is sound and meets the requirements of the problem.

Given these points, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
