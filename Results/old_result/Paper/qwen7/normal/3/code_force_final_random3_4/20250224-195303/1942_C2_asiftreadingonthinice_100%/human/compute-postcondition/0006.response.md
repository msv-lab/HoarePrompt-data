Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `tmp`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `ii`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `ans` as they were in the initial state, and adds that `tmp` is now an empty list.
