Output State: **The final value of `maxi` will be 3, `i` will be `n-1`, and `res` will be an input string. If `res` is equal to '<' during any iteration from 1 to `n-1`, `maxi` will be updated to the current value of `i`. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 3.**

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `maxi` will hold the highest value of `i` for which `res` was '<'. Given the initial conditions and the provided output states after the first three iterations, if `res` was '<' for all iterations up to `n-1`, then `maxi` would be `n-1`. However, since we do not know the exact values of `res` for each iteration beyond the third, the maximum value `maxi` could take is 3, unless `res` was '<' for more iterations, in which case it would be higher but capped by `n-1`. The variable `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`.
