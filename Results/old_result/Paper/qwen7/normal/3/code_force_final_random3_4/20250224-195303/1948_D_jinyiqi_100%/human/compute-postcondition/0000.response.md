Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a list of characters from the input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(input())` takes an input string from the user and converts it into a list of characters. The variable `t` remains unchanged as the code only affects `s`. Therefore, `t` retains its initial state as an integer between 1 and 1000, and `s` is now a list of characters from the input string.
