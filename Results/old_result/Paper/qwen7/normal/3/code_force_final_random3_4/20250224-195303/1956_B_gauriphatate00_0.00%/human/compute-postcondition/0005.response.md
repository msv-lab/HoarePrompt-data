Output State: **`idx` is 2, `t` is an integer from the list `data`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces, `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `idx`, `t`, or `data`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and `results` is simply initialized as an empty list.
