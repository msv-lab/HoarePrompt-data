Output State: **`palka` is a non-empty list of integers, and `d` is a dictionary. The key `i` from `palka` is now in `d` with a value of 1.**

The code `d[i] = 1` sets the value of the key `i` (which is the next value from `palka`) in the dictionary `d` to 1. Since `palka` is a non-empty list of integers, the next value from `palka` is taken as the key `i`. After executing the code, the dictionary `d` will have the key `i` with a value of 1. All other elements of `palka` and the other contents of `d` remain unchanged.
