Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `cases`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex`, which is the encoded value.

2. **Decoding the Encoded Value:**
   - The program attempts to decode the encoded value by breaking it down into three parts.
   - However, the logic in the loop for decoding is flawed:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it incorrectly appends 1 and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 27 and 51, it incorrectly appends 26 and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - Otherwise, it again incorrectly appends 26 and subtracts 26 from `lex`.

3. **Sorting and Printing:**
   - After appending the values to `arr`, it sorts `arr`.
   - It then prints the characters corresponding to the sorted values using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through the example test cases provided:

#### Test Case 1: `lex = 24`
- Expected Output: `aav`
- Actual Output: `aaa` (incorrect)

#### Test Case 2: `lex = 70`
- Expected Output: `rzz`
- Actual Output: `aaz` (incorrect)

#### Test Case 3: `lex = 3`
- Expected Output: `aaa`
- Actual Output: `aaa` (correct)

#### Test Case 4: `lex = 55`
- Expected Output: `czz`
- Actual Output: `azz` (incorrect)

#### Test Case 5: `lex = 48`
- Expected Output: `auz`
- Actual Output: `aaz` (incorrect)

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded values. The logic for breaking down the encoded value into individual character positions is incorrect. Therefore, the program will not produce the lexicographically smallest word for most test cases.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
