Output: **NO**

Explanation: 
- The initial state does not provide any specific value for `t`, but it states that `t` must be greater than 1.
- `n` is an integer input from the user, but its exact value is not specified.
- `s` is a string consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times, with a total length of either less than 200 or exactly 200. However, the value of `s` itself is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- The print statement simply outputs the string 'NO', regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `s`.

Therefore, the output is **NO**.
