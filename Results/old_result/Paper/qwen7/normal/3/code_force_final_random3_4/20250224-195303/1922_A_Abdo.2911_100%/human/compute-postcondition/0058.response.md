Output State: **`possible` is either True or False, `t` is `k - 1`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The values of `possible` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `t` is defined as `k - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, but since no previous iteration context is given, we keep it as `t` is `k - 1`.
