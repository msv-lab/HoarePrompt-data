Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct; `v` is a list of length n+1 where each element is equal to an integer input split from the input string and converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and then prepends a `0` to the resulting list. The initial state of `v` being a list of length `n+1` where each element is `0` is replaced by a list of length `n+1` where the first element is `0` and the rest are integers input by the user. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `p` is not affected by this operation.
