Output State: **`a` is the next element in `arr`, `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` contains at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary, `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `current_pair` is either updated to `(rx, ry)` if `current_pair` is in `freq` or set to `(a % x, a % y)` if it is not, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `rx` to `(-a % x + x) % x`. This expression ensures that `rx` is always a non-negative number less than `x`. The values of `a`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `freq`, `count`, `current_pair`, and `ry` remain unchanged from their initial states.
