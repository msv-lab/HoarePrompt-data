Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    l = int(input())
    s = [(0) for i in range(l)]
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = ''
    for j in array:
        ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
        s[j] += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The final value of `ans` will be a string composed of characters whose ASCII values are `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in the `array`, where `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration until all elements in `array` have been processed. After processing all elements, the value of `s[j]` for each `j` in `array` will be incremented by the number of times `j` was used in the loop.

In simpler terms, `ans` will contain a string formed by converting the values in `s` (starting from index `j` and incrementing `j` each time) to their corresponding characters using ASCII, and `s` will be incremented for each element in `array`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is `k + 1`, `input_value` must be greater than `k + 1`, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` elements, each initialized to 0, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())` but now all elements have been processed (the list is empty), `ans` is a string where each character corresponds to `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in the original `array`, with `s[j]` incremented by 1 for each iteration.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` remains unchanged as `k + 1`. The condition that `input_value` must be greater than `k + 1` also remains unchanged. The variable `l` and the initial state of list `s` remain the same. The list `array` will be empty since all elements have been processed. The string `ans` will contain a sequence of characters derived from `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in the original `array`, with each `s[j]` incremented by the number of times `j` was used in the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The variable `array` contains a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers where each element has been incremented by the number of times the loop has executed, `ans` is a string that concatenates characters based on the incremented values in `s`, and `i`, `input_value`, `l`, and the initial state of `s` remain unchanged.

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `array` will still hold the list of integers it started with. The list `s` will have each of its elements incremented by the number of times the loop ran. For each iteration of the loop, the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97` (where `j` is an element from `array`) is appended to the string `ans`. The variables `i`, `input_value`, `l`, and the initial state of `s` will retain their original values from the initial state.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
