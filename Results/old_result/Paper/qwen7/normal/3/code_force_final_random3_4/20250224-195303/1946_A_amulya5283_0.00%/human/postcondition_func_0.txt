The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (the length of the array `a`) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (each `a_i` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive). For each test case, it sorts the array, finds the median, and then performs operations on a subset of the array using a heap data structure. It counts the number of operations needed to ensure all elements in the heap are greater than the median. Finally, it returns a list named 'results' containing the total number of operations performed for all test cases.
