You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        x = 0
        
        y = 100000000
        
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        
        print(x - y)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `e` is equal to `t`, `l` is the length of the `nums` list, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `x` is the maximum value found in the `nums` list during the loop's execution, and `y` is the minimum value found in the `nums` list during the loop's execution.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `e` will be equal to `t` because the loop runs `t` times. The variable `l` will remain unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The variable `x` will hold the maximum value found in the `nums` list across all the lists processed by the loop. Similarly, the variable `y` will hold the minimum value found in the `nums` list across all the lists processed by the loop. The other variables (`t` and `nums`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop body.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and a list of n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of t and the list of integers.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
