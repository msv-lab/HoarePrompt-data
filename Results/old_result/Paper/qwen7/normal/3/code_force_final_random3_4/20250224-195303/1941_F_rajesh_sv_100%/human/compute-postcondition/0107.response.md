Postcondition: **`ans` holds the minimum value among all the updates made during the loop, `mid` is the last midpoint calculated before the loop exited, `l` and `h` are equal to each other (representing the final boundaries of the search range), `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are the sums of `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` for the last midpoint `mid`, and `f` is the last value from the sequence `F` used in the comparisons. If `l` equals `h`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f).**
