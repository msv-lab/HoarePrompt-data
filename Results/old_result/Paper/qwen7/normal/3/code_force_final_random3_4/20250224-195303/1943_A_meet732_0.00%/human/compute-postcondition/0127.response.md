Output State: **`j` is 3, `cntl[2]` is less than 2, `c` is equal to the original value of `c` minus 1.**

Explanation: The code `c -= 1` decrements the value of `c` by 1. Since the initial state mentions that `c` is equal to the original value of `c` minus 1, after executing `c -= 1`, `c` will now be equal to the original value of `c` minus 2. However, since the exact original value of `c` is not specified, we can only say that `c` is now one less than its original value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
