Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Function `func_1` is not properly defined**: The function `func_1` is defined but not used in the main loop where test cases are processed. Instead, there is a placeholder `func_1()` in the main loop, which should be replaced with the actual processing logic.

2. **Incorrect handling of queries**: The logic for handling queries is flawed. Specifically, the way the intervals are processed and the conditions for printing results are not correctly implemented. For example, the use of `bisect_left` and the subsequent checks do not correctly identify the valid pairs `(i, j)` within the query range `[l, r]`.

3. **Unnecessary imports**: Some imports like `log`, `log2`, `pow`, `gcd`, `ceil`, and `floor` are not used in the program and can be removed to simplify the code.

4. **Debugging prints**: The debug prints (`print(nums)` and `print(l, r)`) are only executed when `ppp == 23`, which is not a standard way to handle debugging and can be removed or modified.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import *
from bisect import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    nums.append(-1)  # Add a sentinel value at the end
    arr = []
    s = 0
    for i in range(N):
        if nums[i] != nums[s]:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, nums[s]))
            s = i
    LA = len(arr) - 1

    Q = int(input())
    for _ in range(Q):
        (l, r) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        (s, e, _) = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        if s > l:
            if s == 1:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
    if _ != tc - 1:
        print()  # Print a newline between test cases
```

This corrected version properly processes each test case and handles the queries as required.
