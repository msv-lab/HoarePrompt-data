Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `res` is incremented by 1 each time `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]` for every `i` in the range from `mdx` to `n-1`, and `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will have been decremented by the number of times the loop has run (which is `n - mdx`). The variable `mdx` remains as initially calculated (`n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`). The variable `i` will be set to `n - 1`, indicating the last index the loop processed. The variable `res` will hold the total count of occurrences where `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]` for all `i` in the specified range. The list `a` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop.
