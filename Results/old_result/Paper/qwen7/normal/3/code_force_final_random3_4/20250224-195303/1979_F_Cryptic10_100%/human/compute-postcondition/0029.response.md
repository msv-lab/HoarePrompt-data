Output State: **`v1` is `len(vx) - 4`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 2`, `vx` is the list with two elements removed at indices `v1` and `v3`, `v3` is the first element returned by `q(0)`**.

Explanation: The code removes `v3` from the list `vx`. Initially, `v1` was `len(vx) - 3` and `v2` was `len(vx) - 2`. After removing `v3`, the length of `vx` decreases by one, making `v1` now `len(vx) - 4` (since one more element was removed). The value of `v2` remains unchanged because it was calculated based on the original length of `vx`. The value of `v3` is the first element returned by `q(0)`, which does not change. The list `vx` now has two elements removed: one at index `v1` and one at index `v3`.
