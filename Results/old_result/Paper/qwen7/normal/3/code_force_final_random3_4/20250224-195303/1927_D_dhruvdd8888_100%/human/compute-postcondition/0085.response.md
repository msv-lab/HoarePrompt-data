Based on the initial state provided:

- `input_value` is a positive integer.
- `l` is the first integer from a new input split by space and converted to an integer.
- `r` is the second integer from the same new input split by space and converted to an integer.
- `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`.
- `s` is the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.
- `e` is the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.
- `arr` is a sorted list.
- `l` and `r` are now the integers obtained from the input.
- `eli` is updated to the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`.
- `s` is the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between the updated `eli` and `LA`.
- `e` is the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between the updated `eli` and `LA`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

This statement directly prints the values `-1` and `-1` without any dependencies on the variables `l`, `r`, `eli`, `s`, or `e`. Therefore, the output is simply the two numbers `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **-1 -1**
