Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in arr:`. This means the loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is `i`
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is the first integer input split from the input string
   - `m` is the second integer input split from the input string
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer
   - `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string
   - `res` is a list of zeros with length `n`
   - `i` is the first element of `arr`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `arr`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the current element being processed in the loop, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in the list `arr`.
   - All other variables (`ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `res`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `ans` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `t` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `m` remains the same.
   - `arr` remains the same.
   - `s` remains the same.
   - `res` remains the same.
   - `i` changes to the next element in `arr`.

Given that `i` is the first element of `arr` at the start of the first iteration, the next element in `arr` will be the second element. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is `i`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `m` is the second integer input split from the input string, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string, `res` is a list of zeros with length `n`, `i` is the second element of `arr`**.
