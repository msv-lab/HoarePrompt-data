Output State: **`b[i]` is incremented by 1, `i` is set to `i_end + 2`, `j` is `j_end + 1`, and the condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` must still hold true.**

Explanation: The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and the condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` remain unchanged from their initial states.
