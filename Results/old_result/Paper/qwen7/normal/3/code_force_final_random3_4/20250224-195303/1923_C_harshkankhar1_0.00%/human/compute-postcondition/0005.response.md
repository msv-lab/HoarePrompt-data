Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `x` is 1 if `a[1]` is greater than 1 else `x` is 2, `b[1]` is `b[0]` + `x`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b[1]` to be the sum of `b[0]` and `x`. Since `b[0]` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot provide its specific value, but we know it will be added to `x` to form `b[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
