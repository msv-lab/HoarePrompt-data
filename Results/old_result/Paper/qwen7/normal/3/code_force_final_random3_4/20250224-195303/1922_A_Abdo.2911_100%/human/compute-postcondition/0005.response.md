Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string.**

The code `c = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the input, and assigns the result to the variable `c`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
