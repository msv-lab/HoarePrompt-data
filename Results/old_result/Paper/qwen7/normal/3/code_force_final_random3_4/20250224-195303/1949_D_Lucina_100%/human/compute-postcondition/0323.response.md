Output State: **`xx` is a 2D list, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `j + 1`, `nx` is `nx + xx[i][j - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `nx` by adding the element `xx[i][j - 1]` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `nx` now holds the sum of its original value and the specified element from the 2D list `xx`.
