Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`.

3. **Analyze the Postcondition**:
   - If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then:
     - `max_diff` is updated to `diff`.
     - `next_max_diff` is updated to `max_diff`.
     - `index` is set to 3.
     - `i` is set to 3.
     - `diff` remains `A[1] - A[0]`.
   - Otherwise:
     - `max_diff` remains `-inf`.
     - `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff`.
     - `index` remains `None`.
     - `i` remains 2.
     - `diff` remains `A[1] - A[0]`.

4. **Determine the Current State**:
   - From the postcondition, we know that `i` is either 3 or 2.
   - Since the loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `i < n`, if `i` is 3, it means the loop has already completed its first iteration (since `i` starts from 1).

5. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - If `i` is 3, the loop will continue to the next value of `i`, which would be 4.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to 4.

6. **Maintain Other Variables**:
   - `n` is not specified to change, so it remains as it was.
   - `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, and `diff` remain as they were in the postcondition.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`max_diff` is as it was, `next_max_diff` is as it was, `index` is as it was, `i` is 4, `diff` is as it was**
