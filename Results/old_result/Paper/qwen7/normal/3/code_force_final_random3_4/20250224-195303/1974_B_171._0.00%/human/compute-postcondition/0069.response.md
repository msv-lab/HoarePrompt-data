Output State: **`encoded` is an empty string, and `decoded` is a list containing all characters from the original `encoded` string, each replaced according to the `mapping`. If a character is not found in `mapping`, it is mapped to the corresponding character from 'a' to 'z' and added to `decoded`.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the `encoded` string will be fully consumed (i.e., it becomes an empty string), and the `decoded` list will contain the complete decoded sequence based on the mappings established during the loop's execution.
