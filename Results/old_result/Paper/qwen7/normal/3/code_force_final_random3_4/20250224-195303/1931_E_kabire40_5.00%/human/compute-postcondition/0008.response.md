Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least one string; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the string `x`; `rev_res` is `rev_res` plus `x`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res = rev_res + x` updates the variable `rev_res` by adding the value of `x` (which is the integer value of the reverse of the string `x`) to `rev_res`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
