Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `ans` is the square of the second element of `arr`**.

Explanation: The code `ans *= i` multiplies the current value of `ans` by the value of `i`. Since `ans` was initially equal to the second element of `arr`, and `i` is also the second element of `arr`, `ans` is updated to be the product of `ans` and `i`, which is essentially squaring the second element of `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
