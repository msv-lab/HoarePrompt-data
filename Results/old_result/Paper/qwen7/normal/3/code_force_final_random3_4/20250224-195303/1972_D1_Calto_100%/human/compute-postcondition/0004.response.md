Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `i` is 2, `x` is `n - 1`, `y` is 4**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state is: `cnt` is -1, `i` is 2, `x` is `n - 1`, `y` is 4.
2. The code updates `cnt` using the formula: `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.
3. First, calculate `math.ceil(x / y)`: Since `x` is `n - 1` and `y` is 4, `x / y` is `(n - 1) / 4`. The ceiling of this value depends on the value of `n`. However, since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we keep it as `(n - 1) / 4` for now.
4. Next, calculate `x % y == 0`: This checks if `(n - 1)` is divisible by 4. Again, without knowing the exact value of `n`, we cannot determine this boolean value directly, but we know it will be either `True` or `False`.
5. Update `cnt`: `cnt` is updated to `-1 + math.ceil((n - 1) / 4) + (x % y == 0)`.
6. Simplify the expression: Since `x % y == 0` is a boolean, it evaluates to either 0 or 1. Let's denote the boolean result as `b`. So, `cnt` becomes `-1 + math.ceil((n - 1) / 4) + b`.
7. For the sake of simplicity and given the problem constraints, let's assume the simplest case where `n` is such that `(n - 1) / 4` is an integer (e.g., `n = 5`). In this case, `math.ceil((n - 1) / 4) = 1` and `b = 1` (since `(n - 1) % 4 == 0`). Thus, `cnt` would be `-1 + 1 + 1 = 1`.
8. The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the final state is: `cnt` is 1, `i` is 2, `x` is `n - 1`, `y` is 4.
