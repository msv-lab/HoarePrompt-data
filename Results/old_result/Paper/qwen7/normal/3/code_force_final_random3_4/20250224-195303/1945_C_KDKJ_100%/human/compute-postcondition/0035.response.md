Output State: **`i` is 0, `left` is `S[0][0]`, `lsum` is 0, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n - i`. The condition `(left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum)` is true.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are updated or affected by the `continue` statement, the values of `i`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, and `rsum` remain unchanged. The condition specified in the initial state also remains true.
