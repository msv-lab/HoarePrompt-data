Postcondition: `rank` remains unchanged, `suit` is the next key in the `suits` dictionary, `trumps` is a list with one element less than before, and `answers` is a list with a new element `f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'` if `trumps` is not empty. If `trumps` is empty, the variables `rank`, `suit`, `trumps`, and `answers` remain unchanged.
