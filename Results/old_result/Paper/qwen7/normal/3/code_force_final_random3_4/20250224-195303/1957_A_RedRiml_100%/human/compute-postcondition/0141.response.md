Output State: **`palka` is a non-empty list of integers, `d` is a dictionary, and `pl` is a list containing the integer `i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pl.append(i)` appends the integer `i` to the list `pl`. Since `palka` and `d` are unaffected by this operation, their states remain as they were in the initial state. The list `pl` now includes the integer `i`.
