Based on the initial state provided:

- `shapes` is increased by the total count of each element in `palka` divided by 3.
- `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they appeared.
- The count of each element in `d` is greater than or equal to 3 after all iterations.

However, the exact values of `shapes`, `palka`, and `d` are not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the precise numerical value of `shapes`. We can only describe it in terms of the operations performed on `palka`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the value of `shapes` after it has been incremented by the total count of each element in `palka` divided by 3.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is increased by the total count of each element in palka divided by 3)**
