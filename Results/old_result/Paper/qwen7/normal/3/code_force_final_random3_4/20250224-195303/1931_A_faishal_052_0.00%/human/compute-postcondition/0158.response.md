Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, printing 'a', 'b', and 'c' in sequence.

Explanation: Given the loop runs three times (`range(3)`), and each iteration sets up `arr` with values based on the condition of `lex`. Regardless of the initial value of `lex`, the final state of `arr` after sorting will always include `1`, `26`, and `lex` (which is less than or equal to 26). Therefore, after sorting, `arr` will be `[1, 26, lex]`. When converting these values to characters using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`, the output will consistently be 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Hence, after all iterations, the loop prints 'abc'.
