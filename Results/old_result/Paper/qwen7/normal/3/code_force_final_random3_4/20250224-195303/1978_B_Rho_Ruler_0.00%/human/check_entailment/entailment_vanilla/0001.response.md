Reasoning:
1. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize Bob's profit based on the given problem statement.
2. The main loop in the `__main__` function attempts to find an optimal value of `k` using binary search, but the condition in `func_1` is not aligned with the problem requirements.
3. The goal is to maximize profit, not to check if a certain profit is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. The function `func_1` should calculate the total profit for a given `k` and compare it with the previous best profit.
4. The binary search approach is unnecessary here because the problem can be solved more straightforwardly without binary search. We can simply iterate over all possible values of `k` from 0 to `n` and calculate the profit for each `k`, keeping track of the maximum profit found.
5. The provided solution does not handle the calculation of profit correctly and does not ensure that the maximum profit is found.

Correctness: **False**

A corrected version of the program would look like this:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(n + 1):
            profit = 0
            for i in range(1, k + 1):
                profit += b - i + 1
            for i in range(k, n):
                profit += a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This version iterates over all possible values of `k`, calculates the profit for each `k`, and keeps track of the maximum profit found.
