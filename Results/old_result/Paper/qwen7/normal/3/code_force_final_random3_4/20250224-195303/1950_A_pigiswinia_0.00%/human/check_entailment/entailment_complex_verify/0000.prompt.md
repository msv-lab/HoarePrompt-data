You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations, with `t` being the total number of iterations specified initially. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated according to the conditions within the loop for each iteration. If `a < b < c` was true for any iteration, 'STAIRS' was printed for that iteration; if `a < b > c` was true, 'PEAK' was printed; otherwise, 'NONE' was printed. The variable `i` is now equal to `t - 1`, as the loop runs from `i` in the range `0` to `t-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each set, it checks if `a < b < c` or `a < b > c`. If the first condition is met, it prints 'STAIRS'; if the second condition is met, it prints 'PEAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NONE'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a small typo in the output statement for the "STAIRS" case. It prints 'STAIRS' instead of 'STAIR'. This will cause the output to be incorrect for all test cases where the digits form a stair. For example, for the input `1 2 3`, the program should print `STAIR` but it prints `STAIRS`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
