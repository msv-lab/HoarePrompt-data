### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to find the optimal position `i` to place a road such that at least half of the residents on both sides of the road are satisfied. The satisfaction criteria are:
   - For the left side: At least \(\lceil \frac{i}{2} \rceil\) residents prefer to live on the left.
   - For the right side: At least \(\lceil \frac{n-i}{2} \rceil\) residents prefer to live on the right.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Input**: Integer `n` and string `a` of length `n`.
   - **Process**:
     - Calculate prefix sums for '0's and '1's using `S`.
     - Iterate through all possible positions `i` from 0 to `n`.
     - For each `i`, compute the number of '0's (`left`) and '1's (`right`) on the left and right sides.
     - Check if the conditions for satisfaction are met.
     - Update `ans` to the minimum `i` that satisfies the conditions and minimizes the distance to `n/2`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - **Input**: No parameters directly passed.
   - **Process**:
     - Reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.

4. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it computes the optimal position `i` using `func_1()`.
   - The logic in `func_1()` is sound and follows the problem statement accurately.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
