Functionality: **The function processes a series of inputs where `t` specifies the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. It then checks specific conditions involving these values and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on those conditions. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
