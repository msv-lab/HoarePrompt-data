Output State: **`prev` is equal to `curr`, `curr` is equal to the second element in `nodes[curr]` that is not equal to `e` and is different from `prev`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` to be the second element in the list `nodes[curr]` that is not equal to `e` and is different from `prev`. The variable `prev` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
