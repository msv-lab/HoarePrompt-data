Output State: **`a` is updated to the next element from `inp`, `x` retains its current value, `y` is now equal to `a`, `ans` is incremented by 1, and the result of `x == y` is a boolean value (True or False) depending on whether `x` is equal to `y`.**

This means that the variable `ans` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `a`, `x`, `y`, and the boolean result of `x == y` remain as described in the initial state, except that `y` is now equal to the updated value of `a`.
