Postcondition: `a` is updated to the next element from `inp`. `x` and `y` retain their current values unless `a` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`, in which case `x` retains its current value, `y` is updated to `a`, `ans` is incremented by 1, and `x == y` is a boolean value indicating whether `x` is equal to `y`.
