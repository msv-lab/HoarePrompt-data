Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly identifies segments in the array `nums` where the elements are the same and stores these segments along with their starting indices.
2. For each query defined by indices `l` and `r`, the function uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the relevant segment in the preprocessed list `arr`.
3. Based on the position of `l` and `r` relative to the identified segments, the function correctly prints the indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i â‰  a_j` or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.
4. The overall logic of the function matches the problem description and the provided example input and output.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the execution states of the program.

Correctness: **True**
