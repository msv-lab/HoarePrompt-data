Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not always maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all \(n\). Specifically, for \(n = 3\), the program outputs the following coordinates:

```
1 1
1 2
2 3
```

However, the optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) should include three points such that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) has the maximum number of distinct distances. A correct arrangement would be:

```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```

This arrangement results in the set of distances \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\), which has 3 elements. The program's output only includes 2 distinct distances (\(0\) and \(1\)).

Therefore, the program fails to provide the optimal solution for \(n = 3\), making it incorrect.
