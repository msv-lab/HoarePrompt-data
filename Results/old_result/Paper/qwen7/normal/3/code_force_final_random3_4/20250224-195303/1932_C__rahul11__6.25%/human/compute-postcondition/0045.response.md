Output State: **`c` is 4, `k` is 2, `ans` is `ans` // `arr[r]` % MOD, `res[c]` is `ans` % `m` % `MOD`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by performing integer division by `arr[r]` and then taking modulo `MOD`. The values of `c` and `k` are both incremented by 1. The state of `s[k]`, `ans`, `c`, `k`, `res[c]`, `m`, `arr[r]`, and `MOD` are updated accordingly. The initial conditions of `c` being 3 and `k` being increased by 1 (new value is `k + 1`) are maintained, and `s[k]` is still checked against 'L', `ans` is updated accordingly, `c` is increased by 1, `k` is increased by 1, `res[c]` is set to `ans % m % MOD`, and `l` or `r` is adjusted based on the condition.
