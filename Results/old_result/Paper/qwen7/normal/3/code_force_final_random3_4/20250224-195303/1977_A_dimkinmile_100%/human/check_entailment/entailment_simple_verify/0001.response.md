### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Logic Check**:
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative.
     - If `n - m` is even, it means the number of moves to add or remove cubes can be balanced.
     - If `n - m` is non-negative, it means the final number of cubes `m` can be achieved by performing `n` moves.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs "Yes" or "No" in the required format.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic check. Specifically, the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` does not fully capture the requirement that the number of moves must be sufficient to achieve the desired number of cubes. 

- The condition ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative, but it does not ensure that `n` is at least `m`. For example, if `n = 2` and `m = 3`, the difference `n - m = -1`, which is odd and negative, and the program would incorrectly print "No". However, it is possible to achieve `m = 3` by adding 3 cubes, which is within the allowed `n = 2` moves if we consider the possibility of removing cubes first and then adding them back.

To fix this, the condition should be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least `m`. This can be done by checking if `n >= m` and then ensuring that `(n - m) % 2 == 0`.

### Corrected Condition:
```python
if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
```

With this corrected condition, the program will correctly determine whether it is possible to achieve the desired number of cubes `m` after `n` moves.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the corrected condition, the program now accurately checks whether it is possible to achieve the desired number of cubes after `n` moves.

**Final: True**
