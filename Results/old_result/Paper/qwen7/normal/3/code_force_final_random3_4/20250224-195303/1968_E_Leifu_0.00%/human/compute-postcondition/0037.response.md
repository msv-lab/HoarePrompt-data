The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `n` is an input integer, and it is assigned the value of `int(input())`.

The `print('1 1')` statement will print the string `'1 1'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, and `n`.

Output: **1 1**
