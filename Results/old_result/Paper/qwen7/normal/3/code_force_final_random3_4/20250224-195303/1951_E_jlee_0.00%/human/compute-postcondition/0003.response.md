Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string**.

The code `s = list(string)` converts the input string into a list of its characters. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and `s` now holds the characters of the input string as a list.
