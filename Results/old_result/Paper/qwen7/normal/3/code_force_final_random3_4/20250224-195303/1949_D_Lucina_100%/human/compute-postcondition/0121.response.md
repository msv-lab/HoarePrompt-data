Postcondition: **`i` is 1; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24; `a` is a list of length n+1; `b` is a list of length n+1; `xx` is a list containing all the strings `x` entered during the iterations of the loop; `j` is equal to `n`; `sa` is a list containing the element `1`; `sb` is a list containing the element `i`. If `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, then `a[i]` remains 0 and `b[i]` becomes 0. Otherwise, `a[i]` remains greater than 0 and `b[i]` remains 0.**
