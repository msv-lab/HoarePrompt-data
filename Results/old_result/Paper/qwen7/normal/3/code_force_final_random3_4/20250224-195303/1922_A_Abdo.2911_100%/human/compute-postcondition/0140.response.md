Postcondition: `i` is `n - 1 + t`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is either equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` remains `False` otherwise, `c` is an input string from user input, and the current value of `c[i]` is either equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
