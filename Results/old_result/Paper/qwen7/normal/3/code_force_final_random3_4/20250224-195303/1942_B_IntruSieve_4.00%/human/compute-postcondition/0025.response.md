Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same, `minn` is increased by 1, `mex` is now equal to `minn`.**

Explanation: The variable `minn` is incremented by 1, and since `mex` was previously set to the value of `minn`, `mex` is also updated to reflect this new value. The other variables (`i` and `n`) remain unchanged.
