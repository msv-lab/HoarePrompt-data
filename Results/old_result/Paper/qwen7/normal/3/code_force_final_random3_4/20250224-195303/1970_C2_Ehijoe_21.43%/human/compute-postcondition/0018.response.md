Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` nodes, and `leaves` is an empty deque.**

Explanation: The code initializes a deque named `leaves`. This operation does not affect the value of `i` or the contents of the `nodes` dictionary. Therefore, `i` remains `n-2` and `nodes` retains its state as the adjacency list representation of a tree with `n` nodes. The `leaves` deque is now an empty deque.
