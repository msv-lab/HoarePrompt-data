Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `maxi` is 1
   - `i` is 1
   - `res` is an input string where the current value of `res` is '<'
   - `n` must be greater than 1 (since `range(1, n)` implies `n > 1`)

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be 2.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

Given these points, we need to update the state of `i` and `n` for the next iteration of the loop.

**Final State**:
- `maxi` remains 1 (unchanged)
- `i` becomes 2
- `n` must be greater than 2

So, the updated state is:

State: **`maxi` is 1, `i` is 2, `res` is an input string where the current value of `res` is '<', `n` must be greater than 2**
