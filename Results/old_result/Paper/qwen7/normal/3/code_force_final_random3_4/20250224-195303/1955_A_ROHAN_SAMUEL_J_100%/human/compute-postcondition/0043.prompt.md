You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
        
    #State: Output State: The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will remain unchanged after all iterations of the loop have finished. The loop processes each set of inputs (`n`, `a`, `b`) independently based on the given conditions and prints the result, but it does not modify the values of `n`, `a`, or `b` within the loop itself. Therefore, after all iterations, `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their original values from the last input provided.
    #
    #In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be the same as the values of the last set of inputs provided to the loop. The loop does not alter these values; it only uses them to perform calculations and prints the results.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers t, n, and a, and b indirectly through the constraints given. It returns a value based on specific conditions where t is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers within the ranges 1 to 100 and 1 to 30, respectively.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
