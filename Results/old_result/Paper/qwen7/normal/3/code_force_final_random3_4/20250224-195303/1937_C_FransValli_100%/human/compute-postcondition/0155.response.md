Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `mini` will hold the minimum value among all elements in `arr`, `i` will be equal to the length of `arr`, `maxi` will still be 0, and `res` will be the last input received from the user during the loop execution.

In Natural Language: The final output state will have `mini` set to the smallest element in the array `arr`, `i` will reflect the total number of elements in `arr`, `maxi` remains unchanged at 0, and `res` will contain the last user input received during the loop, which could be either '>' or any other input depending on the user's responses.
