You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000 for each x in test_cases.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        
        best_y = 1
        
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        
        results.append(best_y)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing the `best_y` value for each `x` in `test_cases` after the loop has executed all iterations. The loop processes each `x` in `test_cases` exactly once, finding the `y` that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` plus `y` (i.e., `gcd_val + y`). For each `x`, the corresponding `best_y` is appended to `results`. After all iterations, `results` will contain one element for each `x` in `test_cases`, representing the optimal `y` for each `x`.
    #
    #The other variables retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop: `max_sum` holds the highest `current_sum` found across all iterations, `x` holds the last `x` value processed, `y` holds the last `y` value processed, `gcd_val` holds the last calculated greatest common divisor, and `current_sum` holds the last calculated sum. However, these values are not included in the `results` list but are relevant for understanding the state of the loop's execution.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing the best `y` value for each `x` in `test_cases` after processing all iterations of the loop. Each `best_y` corresponds to the `y` that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` plus `y` (i.e., `gcd_val + y`) for its respective `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of positive integers between 2 and 1000. For each `x` in `test_cases`, it finds the best `y` that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` plus `y` (i.e., `gcd_val + y`). It returns a list `results` containing the best `y` value for each `x` in `test_cases`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `results` containing the best `y` value for each `x` in `test_cases` after processing all iterations of the loop. Each `best_y` corresponds to the `y` that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` plus `y` (i.e., `gcd_val + y`) for its respective `x`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
