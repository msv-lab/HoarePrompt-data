Let's break down the conditions in the `while` loop head:

1. `n != 0`
2. `k > 0`
3. `rep < 60`
4. `n >= k`

We need to ensure that all these conditions are met for the loop to execute at least once.

- The current state is: 
  - `rep` is 0
  - `n` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the input
  - `k` is the integer value of the second space-separated token from the input
  - `k - 59 * (min(n // k, k))` is calculated using the new value of `n` and `k`
  - `number` is 0
  - `tab` is an empty list
  - `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the final iteration
  - `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the final iteration
  - `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k` for the final iteration

To satisfy the loop conditions:

1. `n != 0`: This condition is already satisfied as `n` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the input.
2. `k > 0`: This condition is already satisfied as `k` is the integer value of the second space-separated token from the input.
3. `rep < 60`: This condition is already satisfied since `rep` is 0.
4. `n >= k`: This condition may not be satisfied based on the initial values of `n` and `k`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `n >= k` is true.

State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the input, `k` is the integer value of the second space-separated token from the input, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`**
