Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test\_cases} \leq 10^4\), `i` is 3, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer**.

Explanation: The line `answers.append('Bob')` adds the string `'Bob'` to the list `answers`. The values of `test_cases`, `i`, and `clues` remain unchanged from their initial states.
