Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `j` is 1, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is False, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `i` is 2, `t` is 2, and the value of `x` is the first element of the list `s`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, and `count` is greater than or equal to 0. If the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and either `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `count2` is equal to `count` or `count2` is 0, we continue the loop. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, `count` is either unchanged if `count2` is greater than `count`, or set to 3 if `count2` is between 0 and `count` (exclusive), and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, and `count` is 3. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to 3, and either `count2` is initialized to 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, or `count2` remains unchanged and is not greater than `count`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
