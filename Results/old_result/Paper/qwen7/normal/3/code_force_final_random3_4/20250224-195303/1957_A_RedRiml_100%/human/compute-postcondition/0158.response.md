Based on the initial state provided, the value of `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3. However, the actual values of `d` and `pl` are not specified. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `shapes`.

The print statement will output the value of `shapes`, which is the sum described above.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the sum of d[j] // 3 for all j in pl where d[j] >= 3)**
