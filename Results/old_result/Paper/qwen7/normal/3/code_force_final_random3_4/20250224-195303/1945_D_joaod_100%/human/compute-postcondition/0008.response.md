Output State: **`total` is 0, `cases` must be greater than 0, `na_frente` is the original value minus 2, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `best` is set to the maximum floating-point value.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `best` to the maximum floating-point value using `sys.float_info.max`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for all variables except `best`, which is now set to the maximum possible floating-point value.
