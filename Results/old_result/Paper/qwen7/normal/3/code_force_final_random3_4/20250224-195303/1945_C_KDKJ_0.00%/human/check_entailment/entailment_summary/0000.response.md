Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the optimal position `i` for placing the road such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side of the road.
2. Function `func_1()` correctly processes the input and calculates the necessary counts of '0's and '1's on both sides of each potential position `i`.
3. It checks whether the counts meet the criteria (`left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`) and updates the answer if the current position `i` meets these conditions and minimizes the absolute difference from `n/2`.
4. Function `func_2()` correctly calls `func_1()` for each test case as specified in the problem statement.
5. Both functions together handle the problem as described, including reading multiple test cases and processing each one appropriately.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
