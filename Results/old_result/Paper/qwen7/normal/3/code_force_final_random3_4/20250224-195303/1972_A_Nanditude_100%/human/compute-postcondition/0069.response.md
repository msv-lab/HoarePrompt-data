Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `previous_j + 1`, and `cnt` is `previous_cnt + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1. Since `n` must be greater than 0 and `j` is defined as `previous_j + 1`, these conditions remain unchanged. The updated value of `cnt` is the previous value of `cnt` plus 1.
