Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`.
   - This means `i` will take values starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: According to the given state before the loop, `i` is currently `n-1`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must start from 1 and go up to `n-1` (since the loop increments `i` within the range).
   - Given that `i` is initially `n-1`, the loop will not execute because `i` cannot start from `n-1` and still satisfy the condition `1 <= i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - To make the loop execute, `i` must start from 1. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be 1.

5. **Other variables**:
   - `n` and `k` are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect the loop execution based on the given information.
   - `array`, `answer`, and `a` are not part of the loop head and their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `array` is a list containing numbers from 1 to n, `answer` is a list containing the number 1, `a` is a list containing [1, -1]**
