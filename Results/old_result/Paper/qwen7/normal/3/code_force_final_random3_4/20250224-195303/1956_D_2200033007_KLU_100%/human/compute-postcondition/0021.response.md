Output State: **`is_already_stairs` remains False, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers of length n with the element at index `start_index` changed to 1, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` < n, `res` is a list that will store the operations performed and now contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index)`, and the current value of `i` is 0.**

This means that the value of `arr[start_index]` has been changed to 1, while all other variables remain in their initial states except for `res`, which now includes the updated tuple.
