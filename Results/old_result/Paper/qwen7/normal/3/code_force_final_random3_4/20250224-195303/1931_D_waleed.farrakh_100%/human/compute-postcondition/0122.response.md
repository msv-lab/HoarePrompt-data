Output State: **`a` is the next element in `arr`, `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` contains at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary with the key `current_pair` set to 1, `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `current_pair` is updated to `(a % x, a % y)`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`, and `ry` is updated to `a % y`.**

Explanation:
- The line `freq[current_pair] = 1` sets the value of the key `current_pair` in the dictionary `freq` to 1.
- All other variables (`a`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `count`, `current_pair`, `rx`, and `ry`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
