Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`. The other variables (`preb`, `curr`, `resb`, and `pathb`) are not directly controlled by the loop itself but are modified within the loop body.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i < len(pathb)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

3. **Calculate the New Value of `i`**: For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since only the loop head variables can be adjusted, we only need to update `i`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 2**
