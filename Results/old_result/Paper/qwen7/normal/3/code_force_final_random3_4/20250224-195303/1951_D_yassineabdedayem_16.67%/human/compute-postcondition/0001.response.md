State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop uses `range(t)`, which means `t` must be a valid integer that can serve as the upper limit for the range function.
2. The range function requires `t` to be a non-negative integer.
3. Given the initial state, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
4. Therefore, no adjustment is needed beyond ensuring `t` meets the specified range condition.

So, the state remains: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive**.
