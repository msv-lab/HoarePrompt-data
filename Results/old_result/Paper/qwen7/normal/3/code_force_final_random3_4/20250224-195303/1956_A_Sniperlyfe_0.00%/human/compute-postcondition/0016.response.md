Output State: **The list `res` will contain the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`.**

In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `res` will have been populated with the output of `func_1(n, p)` for every element `n` in the list `qs`. The value of `n` will have progressed through each element of `qs`, and for each element, `func_1(n, p)` will have been called and its result appended to `res`. The variable `t`, which was initially a positive integer, will remain unchanged as it is not used within the loop. The variables `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` will also remain in their initial or updated states from the first iteration, as they are not modified within the loop.
