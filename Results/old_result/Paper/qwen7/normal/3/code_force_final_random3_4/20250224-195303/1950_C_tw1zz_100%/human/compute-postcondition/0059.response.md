Output State: **`h1` is '10', `m1` is the string converted from the second input split by `:`, `time` is an empty string**.

The code `h1 = '10'` assigns the string `'10'` to the variable `h1`. This changes the value of `h1` but does not affect the values of `m1` and `time`. Therefore, the value of `m1` remains as the string converted from the second input split by `:`, and `time` remains an empty string.
