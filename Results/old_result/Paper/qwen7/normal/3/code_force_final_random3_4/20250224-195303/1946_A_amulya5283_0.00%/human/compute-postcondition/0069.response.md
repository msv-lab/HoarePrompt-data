Output State: **`arr` is sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2] - 3`; `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[n // 2 + 3]` to the end of `arr` with each element incremented by 6; `operations` is 9; the value of `results` is `[6]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `operations` (which is 6) to the list `results`. Since the loop increments the `operations` counter by 3 for each iteration and the loop runs 3 more times, the new value of `operations` is 9. The `heap` starts from `arr[n // 2 + 3]` to the end of `arr`, with each element incremented by 6 because the smallest element in the heap was incremented by 3 for each of the 3 iterations. All other variables remain unchanged.
