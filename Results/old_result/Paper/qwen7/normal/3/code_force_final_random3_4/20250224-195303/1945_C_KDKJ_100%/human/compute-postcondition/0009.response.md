Postcondition: `n` is at least 1, `s` is the first character of the string `a`, `x` is the last character of the string `S` plus 1, and `y` is the last character of the string `S`. If the first character of the string `a` is '0', then `x` is the last character of the string `S` plus 1. Otherwise, `x` is the last character of the string `s` and `y` is the last character of the string `s` plus 1.
