Output State: **`a` is greater than or equal to `y`; `y` is equal to `a`; `x` is an integer greater than `a`; all other variables retain their values from the precondition.**

In this case, the variable `y` is assigned the value of `a`. Since `a` is greater than or equal to `y` initially, `y` will now be equal to `a`. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is an integer greater than `a`, and all other variables retain their values from the precondition.
