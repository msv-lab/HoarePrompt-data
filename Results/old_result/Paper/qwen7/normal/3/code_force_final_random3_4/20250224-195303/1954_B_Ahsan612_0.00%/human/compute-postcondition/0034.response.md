Postcondition: `same` is either 3 or 4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list `ar`, `i` is less than `len(ar) - 1`. If `ar[i]` equals `num`, then `same` remains unchanged as either 3 or 4. If `ar[i]` does not equal `num`, then `same` becomes 1, `minn` is updated to be the minimum of `minn` and `same`, and `i` is incremented by 1.
