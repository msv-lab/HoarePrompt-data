Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + (data[idx - data[idx]]), `n` is `data[idx - data[idx]]`, `a` is a list of integers created by mapping `int` over the slice of `data` from `idx` to `idx + n`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(data[idx], a)`, `t` is `t - 1**.

Explanation: The line `idx += n` increments the value of `idx` by the value of `n`. The value of `n` is defined as `data[idx - data[idx]]`. Therefore, `idx` is updated to `idx + data[idx - data[idx]]`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state, with `a` being updated to a list of integers created by mapping `int` over the slice of `data` from `idx` to `idx + n`, and `results` retaining its previous state with an additional element added, which is the return value of `func_1(data[idx], a)`, and `t` decreased by 1.
