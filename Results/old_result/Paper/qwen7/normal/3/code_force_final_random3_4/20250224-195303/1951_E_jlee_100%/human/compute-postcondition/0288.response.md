Output State: **`s` is a string, `done` is True, `count` is `j`, `count2` is 0, `j` is `n`, and we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move directly to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables and the loop condition remains unchanged, the values of the variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was executed. The loop continues to run based on its original condition.
