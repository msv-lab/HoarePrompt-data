Output State: **`v1` is equal to `len(vx) - 4`; `v2` is equal to `len(vx) - 2`; `vx` has had its `v1` element removed; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`**.

Explanation: 
- Initially, `v1` is equal to `len(vx) - 3` and `v2` is equal to `len(vx) - 2`.
- The line `vx.pop(v1)` removes the `v1`-th element from `vx`. Since `v1` was `len(vx) - 3`, removing the `v1`-th element means `v1` is now effectively one index higher, making it `len(vx) - 4`.
- The line `ops += [(v1, v2)]` appends the tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. Given that `v1` is now `len(vx) - 4` and `v2` remains `len(vx) - 2`, `ops` now contains this updated tuple.
