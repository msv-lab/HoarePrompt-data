Output State: **`c` is an integer; `mapping` is a dictionary where the key `chr(c)` is associated with the value `char`; the character represented by `chr(c)` is not in the values of the dictionary `mapping` before the assignment but is after the assignment, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `c` or `mapping`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.
