Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a dictionary `suits` and lists `trumps` and `answers` based on certain conditions but does not return any value. The dictionary `suits` is updated to have all values set to None, the list `trumps` is modified to have one less element, and the list `answers` gains a new element formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump'. The function then continues to the next iteration of the loop without returning any specific value.**
