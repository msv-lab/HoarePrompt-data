Based on the initial state provided:

- `mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`.
- `i` is equal to `n-1`.
- `maxi` is 0.
- `res` is the input string from the user.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down the values being printed:

- `'?'`: This is a literal string and will be printed as is.
- `maxi`: The value of `maxi` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `i`: The value of `i` is `n-1`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `i` will be a positive integer.
- `i`: The value of `i` is the same as the previous occurrence, so it will also be `n-1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **'? 0 0 n-1 n-1'**
