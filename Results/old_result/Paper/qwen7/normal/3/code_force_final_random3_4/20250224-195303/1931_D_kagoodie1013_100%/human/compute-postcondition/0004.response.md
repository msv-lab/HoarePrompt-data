State: **`count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` must be initialized and `arr` must contain at least one element**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `num` is used to iterate over elements in `arr`.
2. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute.
3. The initial state does not provide information about the value of `num`, but since it is used as the loop variable, it must be initialized to the first element of `arr` before the loop starts.
4. The variables `count` and `residue_map` are not directly involved in the loop condition, but they might be modified within the loop body. Therefore, their initial values are provided as context but do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `num` must be initialized (to the first element of `arr`) and `arr` must contain at least one element.
