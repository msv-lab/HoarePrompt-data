Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It increments each element of `a` by its index plus one (`a[i] += i + 1`).
   - This part is correct as per the problem statement.

3. **Using `Counter`:**
   - It uses `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in the modified array.
   - This step is unnecessary because the problem does not require counting occurrences; it just needs to ensure uniqueness when inserting into the set `S`.

4. **Converting to Set and Sorting:**
   - It converts the modified array to a set and then sorts it in reverse order.
   - This step is correct as it ensures that `S` contains unique elements and `b` is sorted in decreasing order.

5. **Constructing the Result Array `ans`:**
   - It iterates through the sorted array and constructs the result array `ans`.
   - It handles the insertion and deletion logic correctly by ensuring that the differences between consecutive elements are respected.
   - The logic for handling the remaining elements at the end is also correct.

6. **Output:**
   - It prints the result array `ans` in the required format.

### Verification Against the Problem Description

- **Uniqueness in Set `S`:** The program correctly ensures that each element is unique when inserted into the set `S`.
- **Sorting in Decreasing Order:** The program sorts the elements in `S` in decreasing order before constructing the final array `b`.
- **Lexicographical Maximization:** The program ensures that the constructed array `b` is lexicographically maximized by carefully handling the differences between consecutive elements.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
