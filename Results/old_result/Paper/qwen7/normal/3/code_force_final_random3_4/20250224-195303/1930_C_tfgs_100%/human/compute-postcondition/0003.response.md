Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `a[0]` is 1**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += i + 1` increments the element at index `i` in the list `a` by the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] + 0 + 1`, which results in `a[0]` being 1. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
