The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `a`. It first removes duplicates and sorts the list. Then, it creates a new list `a_new` where each element starting from the second one is reduced by the corresponding element in a temporary list `a_temp`, which is a copy of the sorted unique list `a_new`. Finally, it returns the transformed list `a_new`.
