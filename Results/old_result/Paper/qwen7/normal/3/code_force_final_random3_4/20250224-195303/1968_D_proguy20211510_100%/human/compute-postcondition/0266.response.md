Postcondition: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `ps` - 1 set to 1; `num_iterations` remains decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of the original `n`; `k` remains at the final value it was set to after the last iteration; `pb` remains at the final value it was set to after the last iteration; `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]`; `p` is a list of integers entered by the user; `a` is a list of integers entered by the user; `pathb` is a list containing all the elements added during each iteration of the loop; `paths` now contains the element `a[ps - 1]` appended to its previous content; if `vis[ps - 1] == 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
