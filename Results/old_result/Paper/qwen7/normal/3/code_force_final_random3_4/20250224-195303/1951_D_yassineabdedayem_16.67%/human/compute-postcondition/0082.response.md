Output State: **`rep` is 1, `n` must not be equal to `Min * Max`, `k` is `k - Min`, `Min` is `min(n // (k + Min), k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / (k + Min)), k)`, `number` is `max(int(n / (k + Min)), k)**.

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to `k - Min`. The values of `Min` and `Max` are recalculated based on the new value of `k`. Since `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)` and `Max` is defined as `max(int(n / k), k)`, these definitions are now adjusted to reflect the new value of `k`. The variable `number` is also updated to be `max(int(n / (k + Min)), k)`. The other variables (`rep`, `n`, and the condition about `n` not being equal to `Min * Max`) remain unchanged.
