Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   
2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - Inside `func_1()`, the size of the array `N` is read.
   - The elements of the array `a` are read and stored.
   - A dictionary `cnt` is used to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.

4. **Calculating MEX:**
   - The variable `t` is initialized to 0.
   - The program iterates from 0 to `N` and checks the count of each integer `i` in `cnt`.
   - If `cnt[i]` is exactly 1, `t` is incremented.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i]` becomes 0, the function returns `i`.

### Correctness Analysis

To determine the correctness, we need to verify if the logic inside `func_1()` aligns with the optimal strategy for the game described.

#### Key Points:
- **Alice's Strategy:** Alice can always pick any available element from `a` and append it to `c`.
- **Bob's Strategy:** Bob can only remove an element from `a` without affecting the order.
- **MEX Calculation:** The goal is to find the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

#### Issues in the Given Code:
1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation:**
   - The code attempts to find the smallest integer `i` such that `cnt[i] == 1` or `cnt[i] == 0` and increments `t` until `t >= 2`.
   - This approach does not guarantee finding the MEX optimally. It only checks for the presence of specific counts rather than the actual absence of numbers in `c`.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To achieve the optimal MEX, we need to ensure that the sequence of moves by Alice and Bob results in the correct MEX value.
   - Alice should aim to create gaps in the sequence to maximize the MEX, while Bob should try to fill these gaps to minimize the MEX.

#### Example Counter-Example:
Consider the input:
```
2
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
```

- For the first test case, the optimal sequence might be:
  1. Alice picks 1 → `a = [0, 0, 1]`, `c = [1]`.
  2. Bob picks 0 → `a = [0, 1]`, `c = [1]`.
  3. Alice picks 0 → `a = [1]`, `c = [1, 0]`.
  4. Bob picks 1 → `a = []`, `c = [1, 0]`.
  - Final `c = [1, 0]`, MEX = 2.

- For the second test case, the optimal sequence might be:
  1. Alice picks 0 → `a = [1, 2, 3]`, `c = [0]`.
  2. Bob picks 1 → `a = [2, 3]`, `c = [0]`.
  3. Alice picks 2 → `a = [3]`, `c = [0, 2]`.
  4. Bob picks 3 → `a = []`, `c = [0, 2]`.
  - Final `c = [0, 2]`, MEX = 1.

The given code does not implement the optimal strategy and thus will not produce the correct MEX values in all cases.

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for calculating the MEX. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
