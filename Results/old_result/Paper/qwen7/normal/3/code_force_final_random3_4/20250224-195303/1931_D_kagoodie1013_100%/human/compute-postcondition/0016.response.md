Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in arr`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `count` is updated by adding the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`.
   - `residue_map` is a dictionary where the key `(-num % x, num % y)` maps to `1 + residue_map.get(current_key, 0)`.
   - `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`.
   - `r_x` is `-num % x`.
   - `r_y` is `num % y`.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - For each `num` in `arr`, the loop body is executed.
   - The value of `count` is updated based on the value from `residue_map` using keys `r_x` and `r_y`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we need to update `num` for the next iteration.
   - Since the loop is iterating over `arr`, the next value of `num` will be the next element in the list `arr`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `count` remains unchanged as it is updated inside the loop body and not directly in the loop head.
   - `residue_map` remains unchanged as it is also updated inside the loop body and not directly in the loop head.
   - `current_key` and `r_x`, `r_y` are derived from `num`, so they will change with the new value of `num`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next value of `num` in `arr`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`count` is updated by adding the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with key `(-num % x, num % y)` mapped to `1 + residue_map.get(current_key, 0)`, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `num` is the next element in `arr`**
