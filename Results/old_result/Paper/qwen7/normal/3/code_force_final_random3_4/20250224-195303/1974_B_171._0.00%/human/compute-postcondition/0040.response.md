Output State: **`c` is 99; `mapping['c']` is 'char'; the character 'b' is not in the values of `mapping`**.

Explanation: The code `mapping[chr(c)] = char` updates the dictionary `mapping` by setting the key `chr(c)` (which is 'c' since `c` is 99 and `chr(99)` is 'c') to the value `char`. The initial state of `c` is 99, and the character 'b' is not in the values of `mapping`, which remains unchanged.
