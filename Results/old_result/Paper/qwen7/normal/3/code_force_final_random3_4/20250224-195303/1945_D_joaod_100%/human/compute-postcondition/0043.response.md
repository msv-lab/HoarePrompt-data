Output State: **`total` is the minimum cost between `0 + custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]` and `best`, `v` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` adds the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`. Given the initial conditions, if `v - 1` was less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` would have been updated to either `0 + custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]` or `best`, and `v` would have been decremented by 1. Since the condition to update `total` and decrement `v` has been met, `total` now includes the cost of passing through `b` at position `v`, and `v` is decremented by 1.
