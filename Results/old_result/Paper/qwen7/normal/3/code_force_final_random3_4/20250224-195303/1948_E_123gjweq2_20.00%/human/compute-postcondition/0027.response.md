Functionality: **The function `make_array` accepts two integers `left` and `right` (with `left` less than `right`) and an integer `clique` representing a clique identifier. It fills the array `arr` with a specific pattern of values between indices `left` and `right`, inclusive, and sets corresponding elements in the array `cliquess` to the given `clique` identifier. Specifically, it first populates the array segment from `left` to `left + mid - 1` with increasing values starting from `small_element`, and then populates the segment from `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` with decreasing values starting from `big_element`. After executing the function, the array `arr` and the array `cliquess` will reflect these changes, and the variables `left`, `right`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` will retain their original values.**
