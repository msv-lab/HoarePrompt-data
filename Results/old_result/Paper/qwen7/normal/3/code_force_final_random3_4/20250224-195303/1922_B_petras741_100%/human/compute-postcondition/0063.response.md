Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, and if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is the sum of all terms calculated in the loop, which can be expressed as \(\sum_{j=1}^{n} q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + \sum_{j=1}^{n} q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho. If `n` is less than 3, `res` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]` takes a single line of space-separated integers as input, splits the input string into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `w`. The values of `t`, `buffer`, `i`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged unless further operations modify them.
