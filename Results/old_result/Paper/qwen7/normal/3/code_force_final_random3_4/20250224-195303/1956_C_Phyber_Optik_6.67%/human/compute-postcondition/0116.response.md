Postcondition: **`sum` is either `2 * sum + n * (n + 1) // 2` or `sum + i * n`, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least `1`, `t` is an input integer representing the number of remaining iterations, `r` is either `i` or `0` depending on whether the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true or false, `i` is `i + 1**.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `sum` will be updated according to the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. If the condition is true, `sum` becomes `2 * sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`; otherwise, it becomes `sum + i * n`. The other variables `j`, `n`, `t`, `r`, and `i` retain their respective properties as described.
