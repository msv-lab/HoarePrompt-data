Output State: **`p[s]` is decreased by 1, `k` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sm` to be the maximum value between its current value and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`. Given that `k` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a[s] * 0 + sp`, which is just `sp`. Therefore, `sm` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `sp`. The other variables (`p[s]`, `k`, `i`, `bm`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
