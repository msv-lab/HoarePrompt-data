Output State: **`test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `i`, and `clues`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
