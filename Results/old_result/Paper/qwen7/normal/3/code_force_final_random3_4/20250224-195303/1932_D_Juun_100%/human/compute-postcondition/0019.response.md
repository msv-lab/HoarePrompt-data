Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string input by the user, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list containing one element which is a string formed by joining the elements of a list obtained by sorting `[suits[suit], rank]` and then converting each element to a string and joining them with spaces if `suits[suit]` is None, otherwise `answers` remains an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values all set to `None` if `suits[suit]` is None, otherwise values are all set to `rank`, `rank` is the rank of the card, `suit` is the suit of the card, and `suits[suit]` is either None or set to `rank`.
