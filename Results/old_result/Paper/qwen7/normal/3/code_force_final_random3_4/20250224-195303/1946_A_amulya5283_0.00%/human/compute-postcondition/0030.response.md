Output State: **`test_cases` is used to assign its i-th element to `n` and `arr`; `arr` is sorted; `median_index` is n // 2; `current_median` is arr[median_index]; `heap` is arr[median_index:]; `heap` is converted into a min-heap.**

Explanation: The code `heapq.heapify(heap)` transforms the list `heap` into a min-heap without changing the values of the other variables. A min-heap is a binary tree where the parent node is less than or equal to its child nodes. The structure of the heap is preserved, but the order might change to maintain the heap property.
