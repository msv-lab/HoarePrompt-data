Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is the variable `f` from the range of `F`.

2. **Determine the initial state before the loop starts**:
   - `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.
   - `l` is equal to `h`.
   - `mid` is the midpoint between `l` and `h` during the last iteration.
   - `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`.
   - `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.

3. **Understand what happens inside the loop**: The loop iterates over each value of `f` in the range `F`. However, since we are only adjusting the state at the start of the loop, we don't need to consider the loop body.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The only variable that changes with each iteration of the loop is `f`. Therefore, `f` will take the next value in the range `F` in the next iteration.
   - All other variables (`ans`, `l`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`) remain unchanged until the loop body updates them.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `ans` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `l` remains `h`.
   - `mid` remains the same as it was during the last iteration.
   - `mid_sum` remains `D[mid] + f`.
   - `mid_next_sum` remains `D[mid + 1] + f`.
   - `f` will be the next value in the range `F`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `l` is equal to `h`, `mid` is the midpoint between `l` and `h` during the last iteration, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `f` is the next value in the range `F`**.
