Output State: **`possible` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is `t + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately surrounding the `break` statement in the given code snippet, the `break` statement effectively indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or conditional block we were inside. The values of the other variables (`possible`, `i`, `n`, `a[i]`, and `c[i]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
