Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `c` is decreased by 1. This means `c` could be any value, but it has been decremented by 1.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1. So, `n` can be 1 or any number greater than 1.
   - `cntl[j]` is less than 2. Since `j` is 1, this means `cntl[1]` is less than 2.
   - Either `c` is false or `j` is equal to `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(j)`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

- The value of `j` is explicitly stated to be 1.
- The other variables (`c`, `n`, `cntl[1]`, and the condition involving `c` and `n`) do not affect the value of `j` that is being printed.

Therefore, the print statement will simply output the value of `j`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
