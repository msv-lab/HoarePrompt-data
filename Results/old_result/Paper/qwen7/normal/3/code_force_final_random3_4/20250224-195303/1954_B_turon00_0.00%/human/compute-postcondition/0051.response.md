Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0, and the first element of `a` is not equal to `tmp`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt = 0` initializes `cnt` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still 0, `n` must still be greater than 0, `ans` remains the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, and the first element of `a` is still not equal to `tmp`.
