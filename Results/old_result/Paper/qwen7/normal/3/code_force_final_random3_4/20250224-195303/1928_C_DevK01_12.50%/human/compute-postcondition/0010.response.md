Output State: **`i` is 1, `w` is an integer such that `w` is the integer part of the square root of `q` and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, and `q` is divisible by `i`; `M` is a list containing the element `i` (which is 1).**

Explanation: The line `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `M`. The values of `i`, `w`, and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states.
