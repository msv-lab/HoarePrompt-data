Output State: **`ans` is the sum of all elements in `tmp` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1` plus `y`, otherwise `ans` remains the same as its value after the last iteration where `y` was greater than or equal to `i - 1`.**

This means that the value of `ans` is updated by adding `y` to it only if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`. If this condition is not met, `ans` retains its value from the last iteration where the condition was true. The other variables (`i`, `tmp`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
