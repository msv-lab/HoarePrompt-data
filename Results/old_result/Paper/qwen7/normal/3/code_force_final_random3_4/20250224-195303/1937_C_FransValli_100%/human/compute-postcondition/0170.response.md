Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means the loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `res` is '<'
   - `maxi` is 1

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop starts from 1 and increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1 = 2`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is now 2, `n` must still be greater than 2.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to 2.
   - `n` must remain greater than 2 to allow the loop to continue.

7. **Other states**: The states of `res` and `maxi` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2**
