Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `x - k + 3`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `x - k + 3`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is an integer.
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `x - k + 3` must be at least 1.
   - `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < x - k + 3`, we need to ensure that `x - k + 3` remains valid for the next iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x - k + 3` must be at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `x - k + 3` must still be at least 1.
   - The value of `i` will increase by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `k` remains the same.
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `x - k + 3` must still be at least 1.
   - `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, and `x - k + 3` must be at least 1; `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`**.

However, since `i` is incremented by 1, we need to reflect this change in the state:

State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, and `x - k + 3` must be at least 1; `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state but is part of the loop condition, the final state should focus on ensuring the loop condition holds true for the next iteration.

Final State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, and `x - k + 3` must be at least 1; `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`**.
