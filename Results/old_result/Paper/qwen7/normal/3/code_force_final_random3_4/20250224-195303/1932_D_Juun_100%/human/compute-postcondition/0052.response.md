Output State: **`rank` is unchanged, `suit` is the next key in the `suits` dictionary, `trumps` is a list with one element less than before, `answers` is a list with a new element `f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'**.

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `rank`, `suit`, `trumps`, and `answers` remain as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.
