Output State: `i` will be `n + 1`, and `n` must be greater than 5.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the final value of `i` will be `n + 1`. The loop starts with `i` as 3 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`. For the loop to run all iterations, `n` must be greater than 5, as it needs to go through at least 3 increments (from 3 to 4, then 4 to 5, and so on) to reach `n`. Therefore, after the loop completes, `i` will be `n + 1` and `n` must be greater than 5.
