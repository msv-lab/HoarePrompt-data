Output State: **`power` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` must be greater than 5, `i` is either 3 or 6, `n` is the integer input from the user, `power` is 4 if `n` equals 1, otherwise `power` is 4 if it does not equal `n` and remains 5 if it does equal `n`.**

Explanation: The line `power = 1` sets the variable `power` to 1. This changes the value of `power` from its previous state (which was determined by the conditions involving `n`), to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
