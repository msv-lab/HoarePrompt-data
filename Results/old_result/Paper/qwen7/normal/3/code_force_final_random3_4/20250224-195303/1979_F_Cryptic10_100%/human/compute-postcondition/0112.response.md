Output State: **`vx` has at least 1 element, `v2` is now the second last element of `vx`, `v3` can be any value, `v1` is removed from `vx`.**

Explanation: The code removes the second last element of `vx`, which is stored in `v1`. After the removal, `v2`, which was the last element of `vx` before the removal, becomes the second last element. The value of `v3` remains unchanged, and `vx` now has at least one element left.
