Output State: **`i` is 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[v]` contains `[u]`**

Explanation: The code `nodes[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `nodes[v]`. Initially, `nodes[v]` contains `[v]`. After executing the code, `nodes[v]` will contain both `v` and `u`, making it `[v, u]`. However, since the initial state only specifies that `nodes[v]` contains `[v]`, we update it to say that `nodes[v]` now contains `[u]` after the append operation. The values of `i`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged.
