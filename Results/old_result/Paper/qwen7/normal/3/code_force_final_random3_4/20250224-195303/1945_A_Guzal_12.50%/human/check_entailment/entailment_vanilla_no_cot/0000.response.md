Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle all edge cases as specified in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of tents required is flawed. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Participants**: The current implementation checks if `b + c` (extroverts and universals combined) is divisible by 3. If not, it increments the tent count by 1. However, this logic does not account for the fact that remaining extroverts need to be paired with universals, and if there aren't enough universals, it should return `-1`.

2. **Logic for Remaining Extroverts**: The program should ensure that every extrovert can find a partner (either another extrovert or a universal). If there are leftover extroverts without a partner, it should return `-1`.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        k = 0
        
        # Tents for introverts
        k += a
        
        # Tents for extroverts and universals
        # Calculate how many full groups of 3 can be formed
        full_groups = (b + c) // 3
        k += full_groups
        
        # Remaining people after forming full groups
        remaining_people = (b + c) % 3
        
        # Check if there are any remaining extroverts without a partner
        if remaining_people > 0 and b > 0:
            if remaining_people == 1:
                # One remaining extrovert cannot form a group
                print(-1)
                continue
            elif remaining_people == 2:
                # Two remaining extroverts can form a group with one universal
                if c >= 1:
                    k += 1
                    c -= 1
                else:
                    print(-1)
                    continue
        
        # Remaining universals after pairing extroverts
        c -= (b + c) // 3
        
        # Tents for remaining universals
        k += c // 3
        
        # Remaining universals after forming tents
        remaining_universals = c % 3
        
        # If there are remaining universals, they can form one more tent
        if remaining_universals > 0:
            k += 1
        
        print(k)
```

This corrected version ensures that all participants' preferences are respected and handles the edge cases properly.
