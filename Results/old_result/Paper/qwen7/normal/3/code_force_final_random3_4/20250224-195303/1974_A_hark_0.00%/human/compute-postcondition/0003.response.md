The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\). For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0**
