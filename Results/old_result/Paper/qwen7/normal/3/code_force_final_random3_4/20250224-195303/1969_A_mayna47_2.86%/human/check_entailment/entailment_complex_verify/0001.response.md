### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Friend Best Friend Mapping**: In `func_1`, it correctly initializes a list `v` to store the best friend mapping and updates it with the input values.
3. **Special Case for Two Friends**: For `n = 2`, the program correctly prints `2` because both friends need to be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
4. **Checking for Direct Pairings**: The program checks if there exists a pair `(i, v[v[i]])` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such a pair exists, it means inviting both friends in this pair will ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. In this case, the program prints `2`.
5. **General Case**: If no direct pairings exist, the program prints `3`, which is the correct answer based on the problem statement and examples provided.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the logic, we find that the program has a flaw in its logic for checking the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i`.

- **Flaw in Logic**: The program constructs the list `v` as follows:
  ```python
  v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
  ```
  This means `v[0]` is always `0`, and the rest of the elements are the indices of the best friends. When checking `v[v[v[i]]] == i`, the program is essentially checking if the best friend of the best friend of the best friend of `i` is `i`. However, this does not guarantee that both `i` and `v[i]` will be invited to the party. Instead, it should check if `v[i]` and `v[v[i]]` form a cycle of length 2.

- **Correct Approach**: To ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party, we need to check if there exists a cycle of length 2 in the best friend mapping. Specifically, we need to check if `v[v[i]] == i` for any `i`.

- **Example Counterexample**: Consider the input:
  ```
  1
  4
  2 3 4 1
  ```
  - The best friend mapping is `v = [0, 2, 3, 4]`.
  - The program will check `v[v[v[1]]] == 1`, `v[v[v[2]]] == 2`, `v[v[v[3]]] == 3`, and `v[v[v[4]]] == 4`.
  - None of these conditions are true, so the program will print `3`, but the correct answer should be `2` because friends 1 and 4 can be invited directly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the program's logic for checking the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` is flawed. The correct approach is to check for cycles of length 2 directly.

### Final:
**False**
