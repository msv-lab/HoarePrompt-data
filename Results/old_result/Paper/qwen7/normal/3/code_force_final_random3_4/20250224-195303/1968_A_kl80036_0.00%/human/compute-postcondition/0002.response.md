Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x // 2`**.

This means that `i` remains unchanged at 0, `t` stays as a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `x` retains its original value as an input integer, and `y` is now assigned the value of `x` divided by 2 using integer division.
