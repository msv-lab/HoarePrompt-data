Output State: **`prev` is equal to `curr`, `curr` is one of the elements in `nodes[curr]` that is not equal to `e` and is different from `prev`.**

Explanation: The code `prev = curr` updates the value of `prev` to be the same as `curr`. The initial conditions state that `prev` is equal to `curr`, and `curr` must be one of the elements in `nodes[curr]` that is not equal to `e` and is different from `prev`. Since `prev` is now equal to `curr`, `prev` still meets the condition of being equal to `curr`, and `curr` still must be one of the elements in `nodes[curr]` that is not equal to `e` and is different from `prev`.
