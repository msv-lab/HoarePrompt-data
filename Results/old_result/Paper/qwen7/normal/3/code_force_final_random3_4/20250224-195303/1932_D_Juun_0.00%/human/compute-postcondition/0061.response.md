Output State: **`suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values all set to None (one key-value pair processed), `trumps` is a list with one less element than before, `answers` is a list with one new element which is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump', we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no specific action is taken within the loop body following the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The `suits` dictionary, `trumps` list, and `answers` list retain their previous conditions, and the loop continues.
