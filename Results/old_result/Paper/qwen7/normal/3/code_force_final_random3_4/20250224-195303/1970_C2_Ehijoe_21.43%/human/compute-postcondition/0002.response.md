Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `empty` is True.**

The variable `empty` is set to `True`, which means no edges have been added to the list `edges`. All other variables retain their initial states.
