Output State: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `current_sum` found during the loop execution, `best_y` is the corresponding `y` value when `max_sum` was updated, `x` is the last value of `x` processed in the loop, `y` is the last value of `y` processed in the loop, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `max_sum` will hold the highest sum of the greatest common divisor plus `y` found across all `x` values in `test_cases`, and `best_y` will be the `y` value that produced this maximum sum. The values of `x` and `y` will be the last pair processed in the loop, and `gcd_val` and `current_sum` will reflect the values from the last iteration of the loop.
