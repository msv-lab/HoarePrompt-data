Output State: **`prev` is equal to `curr`, `curr` is equal to `curr`, `tree` now contains the elements `s`, `curr`, and `e` is different from `curr`.**

Explanation: The code `prev = curr` updates the value of `prev` to be the same as the current value of `curr`. Since `curr` must be one of the elements in `nodes[curr]` that is not equal to `e` and is different from `prev`, the value of `curr` remains unchanged. The precondition that `prev` was initially equal to `curr` still holds true, and `curr` is still one of the elements in `nodes[curr]` that is not equal to `e` and is different from `prev`.
