Output State: **The `trumps` list is sorted in descending order.**

The code `trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)` sorts the `trumps` list in descending order. This means that the ranks of the cards that were part of the trump suit are now arranged from the highest rank to the lowest rank. The `answers` list and the `suits` dictionary remain unchanged from their initial state.
