Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[i]`, `curr` remains unchanged, `resb` is the maximum of its current value and `curr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where the assignments to `i`, `preb`, `curr`, and `resb` were made. Since the `break` statement does not modify the values of these variables, their states remain as they were before the `break`.
