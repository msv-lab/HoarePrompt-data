Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 because `range(n - 1)` generates values from 0 to `n-2`.
3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n - 1`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the initial value of `i` is 0 and that `n` is within the specified range (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5). The other variables (`t`, `edges`, `start`, `empty`, and `nodes`) do not affect the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 2×10^5 inclusive**.
