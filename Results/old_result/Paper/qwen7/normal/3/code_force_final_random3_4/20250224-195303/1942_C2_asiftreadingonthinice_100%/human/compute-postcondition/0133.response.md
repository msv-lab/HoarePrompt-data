Postcondition: `i` is the second element of `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list with at least two elements, and `ans` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus the second element of `tmp` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
