Output State: **`na_frente` is now decreased by 2, `c` is 0, `v` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from input split and converted to integers.**

This means that the value of `na_frente` has been decreased by 1 (as per the initial state), and the code further decreases it by 1 more, making it decreased by 2 in total. The value of `pos_final` is reduced by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
