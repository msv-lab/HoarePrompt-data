You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b such that 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and it is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b.

    #State: Output State: The `test_cases` variable remains as an integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\). The `i` variable is now equal to `test_cases - 1` since the loop has completed all its iterations. The `answers` list contains the results of applying the given logic to each set of input clues for all `test_cases`.
    #
    #In more detail, for each of the `test_cases` provided:
    #- If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is 1, 'Draw' is appended to `answers`.
    #- Otherwise, based on the parity (even or odd) of `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, and the comparison between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]`, 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' is appended to `answers`.
    #
    #The final state of `answers` is a list containing the outcomes for each of the `test_cases` according to the rules defined in the loop.
    for j in answers:
        print(j)
        
    #State: `i` is `test_cases - 1`, `answers` is a list containing the results for each of the `test_cases` according to the rules defined in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of six integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. It verifies that h and w meet specific constraints, and that x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b are within certain ranges. Depending on whether x_a equals x_b or y_a equals y_b, it either returns a specific value or performs additional checks.
