Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `mdx`.

2. **Determine the initial values**:
   - `mdx` is given as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - `i` is initially set to `mdx`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `mdx` to `n`.

4. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is `t - 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - `i` is `mdx`.
   - `res` is incremented by 1 if the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at `mdx` and the loop runs until `i < n`, after the previous iteration, `i` would be `mdx + 1`.
   - `mdx` remains unchanged as it is determined by `n` and does not change within the loop.

6. **Update the states**:
   - `t` is `t - 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `mdx` remains the same.
   - `i` is now `mdx + 1`.
   - `res` is incremented by 1 if `a[mdx] == a[i]` in the previous iteration, but its value remains the same unless the condition is met again.
   - `a` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, `res` is incremented by 1 if the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, and `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.**
