Output State: **`j` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the current value of `s[n - 1 - j]`; `done` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `j`, `n`, `s[j]`, `s[n - 1 - j]`, or `done`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently inside. Therefore, these conditions remain unchanged.
