### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if Bob can form a new rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
   - Two rectangles are considered the same if one can be rotated to match the other (e.g., a \(6 \times 4\) rectangle is the same as a \(4 \times 6\) rectangle).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, no matter how you cut the rectangle, the resulting smaller rectangles will also be odd in both dimensions, and thus cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle (since the product of their dimensions would still be odd).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that a new rectangle can be formed.
   - If the condition is false, it prints 'No', indicating that no new rectangle can be formed.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly identifies when a new rectangle can be formed (i.e., when at least one dimension is even).
   - The logic correctly identifies when a new rectangle cannot be formed (i.e., when both dimensions are odd).

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the program. The program only checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, but it does not account for the specific cases where a new rectangle can be formed even if both dimensions are odd. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle, such as the \(2 \times 6\) example provided in the problem statement.

### Example Counterexample:
- Consider the test case \(2 \times 6\):
  - Both \(a = 2\) and \(b = 6\) are not even, so the program would incorrectly print 'No'.
  - However, as shown in the problem description, from a \(2 \times 6\) rectangle, Bob can cut it into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and rearrange them to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should check if the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle. This involves checking if the dimensions allow for such a cut and rearrangement.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the program does not correctly handle all cases where a new rectangle can be formed, particularly when both dimensions are odd but the rectangle can still be cut and rearranged.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
