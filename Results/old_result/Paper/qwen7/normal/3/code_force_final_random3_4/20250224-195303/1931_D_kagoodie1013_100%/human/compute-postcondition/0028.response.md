State: **`count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` must be defined and `arr` must be a non-empty list**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable in the for loop is `num`, which iterates over each element in `arr`.
2. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in the array.
3. The initial values of `count` and `residue_map` are given as 0 and an empty dictionary, respectively. These values do not directly affect whether the loop can execute, but they should be included in the state for completeness.
4. Since `num` is the loop variable, it must be defined and take the value of each element in `arr` during each iteration. However, the exact value of `num` is not specified, so we only need to ensure that `arr` contains at least one element.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `arr` must be a non-empty list.
