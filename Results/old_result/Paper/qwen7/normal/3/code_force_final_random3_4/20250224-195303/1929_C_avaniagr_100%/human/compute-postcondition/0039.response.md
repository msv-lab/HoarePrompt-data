Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is set to the integer value of the first space-separated token from `s`, `x` is set to the integer value of the second space-separated token from `s`, `a` is set to the integer value of the third space-separated token from `s`, `z` is equal to \(2^n \times (k - 1) + n\), where `n` is the number of times the loop has executed, and `i` is `i + 1`. Additionally, if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` remains unchanged; if `a` is less than `z`, then `a` remains unchanged as well.**
