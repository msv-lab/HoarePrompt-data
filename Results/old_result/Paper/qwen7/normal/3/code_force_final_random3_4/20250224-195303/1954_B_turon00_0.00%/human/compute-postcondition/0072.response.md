Output State: **`ans` is the minimum value between its initial value and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t - 1`, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `tmp = a[0]` simply assigns the first element of the list `a` to the variable `tmp`. Since no other changes were made to the other variables, their states remain the same as the initial state.
