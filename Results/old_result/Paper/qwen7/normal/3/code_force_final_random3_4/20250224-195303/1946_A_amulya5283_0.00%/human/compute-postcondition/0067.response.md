Output State: `arr` is sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2] - 3`; `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[n // 2 + 3]` to the end of `arr` with each element incremented by 3; `operations` is 6.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the `current_median` will be `arr[n // 2] - 3` because the smallest element in the heap (which starts from `arr[n // 2]`) is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs, and it runs 3 times initially. Since the smallest element is incremented by 1 each iteration, after 3 iterations, it will be incremented by 3. The `heap` will start from `arr[n // 2 + 3]` and include elements that were originally in the heap but have been incremented by 3. The `operations` counter will be 6, as it increments by 1 each time the loop runs and the loop runs until the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` is no longer satisfied.
