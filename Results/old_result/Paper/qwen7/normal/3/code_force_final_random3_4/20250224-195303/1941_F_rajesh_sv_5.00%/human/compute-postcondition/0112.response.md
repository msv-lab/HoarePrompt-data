Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `total` is undefined, `students` is undefined, `left` must be less than `right` plus `f`, `l` is `mid + 1`**.

Explanation: The variable `l` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The values of `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `total`, `students`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged from their initial states.
