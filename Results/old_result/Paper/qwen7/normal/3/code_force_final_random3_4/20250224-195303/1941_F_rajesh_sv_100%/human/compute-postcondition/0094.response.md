Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is now `mid`, `ans` is set based on the comparison between `mid_sum - left` and `right - mid_next_sum`.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. The values of `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `h`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
