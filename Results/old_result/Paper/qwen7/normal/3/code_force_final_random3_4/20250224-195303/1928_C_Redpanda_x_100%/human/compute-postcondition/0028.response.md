Output State: **`prime_to_i` is `factor * prime * prime_to_i * prime`, `rest` is the list without its first element, `factor` is the first element of `rest`, `factors[prime]` is incremented by 1, and no new value is yielded.**

Explanation: The code multiplies `prime_to_i` by `prime`. Since `prime_to_i` was initially `factor * prime_to_i * prime`, after the multiplication, it becomes `factor * prime * prime_to_i * prime`. The other variables (`rest`, `factor`, and `factors[prime]`) remain unchanged from their initial states. No new value is yielded since the yield statement is outside this line of code.
