Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the conditions where it's impossible to accommodate all participants based on the constraints provided.
2. The logic for calculating the minimum number of tents is mostly correct but needs some adjustments to ensure accuracy:
   - The program checks if there are enough universals to accommodate all extroverts in groups of three. If not, it directly prints `-1` which is correct.
   - The calculation for the number of tents required should account for the exact distribution of participants into tents.
   - The program increments `k` (the number of tents) by `a` (introverts) and `(b + c) // 3` (groups of three people including extroverts and universals).
   - If there are leftover people after forming complete groups of three, it adds one more tent for those remaining.
3. The program seems to handle the test cases as expected, printing the correct number of tents or `-1` when necessary.

Given the above points, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the solution based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
