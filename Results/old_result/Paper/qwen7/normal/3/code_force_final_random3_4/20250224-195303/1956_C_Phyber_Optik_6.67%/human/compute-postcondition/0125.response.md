Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head defines the variables `j` and the range `1` to `n + r + 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values:**
   - `sum` will accumulate values based on the conditions inside the loop.
   - `j` will start from `n + r + 1` and remain unchanged as the loop progresses.
   - `n` will be decremented to 0 after the loop.
   - `t` will retain its value from the last iteration of the loop.
   - `r` will retain its value from the last iteration of the loop.
   - `i` will start from 1 and increase by 1 in each iteration until `n` becomes 0.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `j` is defined by the range `1` to `n + r + 1`, the initial value of `n + r + 1` must be set correctly.
   - `n` will be decremented to 0, so we need to ensure `n` is set to an appropriate initial value.
   - `t` and `r` should retain their values from the last iteration, but since we are starting the loop, these values are not yet determined. We can assume they are initialized appropriately.
   - `i` starts from 1 and increments, but since we are focusing on the loop head, we don't need to adjust `i` directly.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n + r + 1` and `n`.

State: **`n + r + 1` must be a positive integer, `n` must be a non-negative integer**.

This ensures that the loop can execute with the correct initial values for `j` and `n`.
