Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The logic in `func_1` does not ensure that the maximum beauty is achieved. Specifically, the approach of sorting the array and then interleaving the smallest and largest remaining elements does not always yield the maximum possible beauty.

To achieve the maximum beauty, we should aim to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. The optimal strategy is to sort the array and then pair the smallest element with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. This ensures that the differences (and thus the beauty) are maximized.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, arr)
    results.append(result)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(n // 2):
        max_beauty += abs(arr[i] - arr[n - 1 - i])
    if n % 2 == 1:
        max_beauty += arr[n // 2]
    return max_beauty
```

This corrected function sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by pairing the smallest and largest elements, ensuring the maximum possible differences between consecutive elements.
