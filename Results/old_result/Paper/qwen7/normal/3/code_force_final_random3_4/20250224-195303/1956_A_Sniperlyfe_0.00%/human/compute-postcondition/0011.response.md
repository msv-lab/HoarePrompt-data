Output State: **`res` now contains the result of `func_1(n, p)`, and `n` is the next element in `qs`.**

Explanation: The code `res.append(func_1(n, p))` appends the result of the function call `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. The variable `n` is the next element in the list `qs`, and `p` retains its original value. The initial state of `res` containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` remains unchanged except that the new result is added to `res`. The value of `n` also remains the next element in `qs`.
