Output State: **`prev` is equal to `curr`, `tree` contains all elements from `s` up to and including `e`, `curr` is equal to `e`, and `start` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `start = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `start`. The values of `prev`, `curr`, and `tree` remain unchanged from their initial states.
