Output: **string[:1], string[1:] (where string[:1] is the substring of string from the start up to but not including index 1, and string[1:] is the substring of string starting from index 1 to the end)**

Explanation:
- `j` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is explicitly given as 2.
- `done` is explicitly given as True, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])` will split the string `string` into two parts:
- `string[:j]` will be the substring from the start of the string up to but not including the character at index `j` (which is 1).
- `string[j:]` will be the substring starting from the character at index `j` (which is 1) to the end of the string.

Therefore, the output will be the two substrings separated by a comma.
