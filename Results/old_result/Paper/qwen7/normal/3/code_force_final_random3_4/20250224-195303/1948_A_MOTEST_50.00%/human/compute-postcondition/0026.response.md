Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is 'AAAS', `x` is 1**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` updates the string `ans` by appending twice the character at index `x` of the string `s`. Given that `x` is 1, `ans` originally is 'AAA', and assuming `s` is at least 'A' (since `x` is 1, the character at index 1 of `s` would be 'A'), `ans` becomes 'AAAS'. The values of `t`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged.
