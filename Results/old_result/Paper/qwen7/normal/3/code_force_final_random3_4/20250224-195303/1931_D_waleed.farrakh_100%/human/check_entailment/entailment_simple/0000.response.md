### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads input from standard input and processes it to form test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and stores each test case in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), and the array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Takes a list of test cases and processes each one to find the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It uses a frequency dictionary to keep track of the remainders when elements of the array are divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
   - For each element in the array, it calculates the required remainders and checks if they exist in the frequency dictionary to count the number of beautiful pairs.
   - The logic to calculate the remainders and update the frequency dictionary is correct.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - It processes each test case individually and computes the number of beautiful pairs accurately.
   - The final results are printed correctly.

Given the detailed state transitions and the correctness of the logic in both functions, the program appears to be functioning as intended.

### Correctness:
