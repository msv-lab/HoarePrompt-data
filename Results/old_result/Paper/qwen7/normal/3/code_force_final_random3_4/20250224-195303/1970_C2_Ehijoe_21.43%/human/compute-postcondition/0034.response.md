Output State: **`leaves` is a deque containing all nodes that have only one neighbor in the tree, `moves` is the result of calling `func_1(nodes, start)`, `start` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `moves = func_1(nodes, start)` assigns the return value of `func_1(nodes, start)` to the variable `moves`. The initial state of `leaves` and `start` remains unchanged. Therefore, `leaves` still contains all nodes that have only one neighbor in the tree, `moves` now holds the result of the function call, and `start` remains an input integer.
