Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string, `n` is 1, `done` is False, and the count of `x` in `s` is equal to 1.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
