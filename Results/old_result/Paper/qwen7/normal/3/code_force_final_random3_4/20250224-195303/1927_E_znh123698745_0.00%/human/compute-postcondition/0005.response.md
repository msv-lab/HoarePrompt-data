Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` in the range `1` to `n`. Therefore, `i` should start at `1` and the condition `1 <= i < n` should hold true for the loop to execute.
3. **Check the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least `1` because the loop starts with `i = 1` and goes up to `n-1`.

Given the initial states:
- `a` is `[1, -1]`
- `n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to int
- `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to int
- `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to n inclusive
- `answer` is a list containing the integer 1

The only variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` and `n`. Since `i` starts at `1`, and the loop condition requires `1 <= i < n`, `n` must be at least `1`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` should be `1`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `1`

So, the final state to be adjusted is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
