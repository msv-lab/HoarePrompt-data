Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list, `tmp` is an integer, and `cnt` is an integer. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `cnt`.
