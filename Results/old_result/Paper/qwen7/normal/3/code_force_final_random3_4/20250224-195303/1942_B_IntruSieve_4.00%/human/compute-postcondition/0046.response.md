Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, `minn` is updated based on whether `minn` equals `maxx` or not (either `maxx + 1` or increased by 1), and `mex` is appended with the current value of `minn`. Additionally, `maxx` is the maximum of the absolute differences between `arr[i]` and `minn`, and `arr[i + 1]` and `minn` if `arr[i] > 0`; otherwise, `minn` and `mex` are updated based on the value of `arr[i + 1]`.
