Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `mapping` is an empty dictionary; `decoded` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `decoded`. The variables `encoded` and `mapping` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the length of `encoded` and the fact that `mapping` is an empty dictionary are preserved, while `decoded` is now an empty list.
