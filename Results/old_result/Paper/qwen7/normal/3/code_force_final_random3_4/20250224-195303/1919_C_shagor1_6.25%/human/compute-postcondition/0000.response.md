Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value used to determine the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as the input value (let's call it `num_tests`) is a positive integer. From the given constraints, `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, where `t` is the input value, we know that `num_tests` must be within this range.

3. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop depends on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value meets the required condition. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that the input value is a positive integer within the specified range.

Given the constraints and the loop structure, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that the input value is a valid number of tests.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.

Since the loop itself does not initialize or modify `t`, and the loop will execute based on the input value, the state before the loop starting should reflect the requirement for the input value.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
