Output State: **`arr` is sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n // 2` to the variable `median_index`. Since `n` is equal to `test_cases[i][0]`, `median_index` is calculated as `test_cases[i][0] // 2`. The array `arr` remains sorted in ascending order as no operation was performed on it.
