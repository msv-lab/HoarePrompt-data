Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` is less than 60, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` now contains one additional element which is the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is updated by subtracting the product of `Min` and `Max` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, including the condition that `k` must be greater than 0 and `rep` is less than 60. The values of `Min` and `Max` are recalculated based on the new value of `n`, but they are not explicitly updated in the output state since they depend on the current value of `n`.
