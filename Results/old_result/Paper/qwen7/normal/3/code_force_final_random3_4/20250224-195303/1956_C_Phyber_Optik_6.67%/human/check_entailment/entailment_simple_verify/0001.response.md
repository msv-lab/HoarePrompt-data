### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calculates the sum of the matrix and the number of operations needed.
   - The logic inside the loop seems to be calculating the sum of the matrix and determining the number of operations required.
   - The sum calculation is based on the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) for the first \( r \) rows and \( i \cdot n \) for the remaining rows, where \( r \) is determined such that \( n \cdot (n + 1) / 2 > i \cdot n \).
   - The number of operations is calculated as \( n + r \), where \( r \) is the number of full rows before the partial row.
   - The operations are printed in the format specified: each operation is either a row permutation or a column permutation, and the permutations are simply the identity permutation (1, 2, ..., n).

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic for calculating the sum and the number of operations seems correct. The sum is maximized by filling the top \( r \) rows with the largest possible values and the remaining rows with the next largest values.
   - However, upon closer inspection, the provided solution does not actually perform any operations to achieve the desired permutation. Instead, it prints the identity permutation for both row and column operations, which does not change the matrix at all.
   - The sum calculation is still correct, but the operations themselves are not performing any actual permutations. This means the solution does not satisfy the requirement of performing operations to maximize the sum.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The solution provided does not perform the necessary operations to achieve the desired permutations, even though the sum calculation is correct.
   - Therefore, the solution is not correct according to the problem statement.
