Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `n` must be non-zero; `k` must be greater than 0; `rep` is 0; `number` is 0; `tab` is an empty list; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns `Min` and `Max` based on the values of `n`, `k`. Specifically, `Min` is set to the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, while `Max` is set to the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
