Output State: **`a` is updated to the next element from `inp`, `x` retains its current value, `y` is now equal to `a`, and the result of `x == y` is a boolean value (True or False) depending on whether `x` is equal to `y`.**

This means that `y` has been updated to the value of `a`, which is the next element from `inp`. The values of `x` and the result of `x == y` remain unchanged from their previous states.
