Output State: **`rep` is 2, `k` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `number` is `min(n // k, k)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `Min` to `number`. Since `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)`, `number` will also be `min(n // k, k)`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
