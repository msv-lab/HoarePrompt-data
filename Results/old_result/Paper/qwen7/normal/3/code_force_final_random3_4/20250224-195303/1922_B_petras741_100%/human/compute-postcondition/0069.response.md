Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `j` and the condition `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `j` is currently 1.
   - `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < n`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `j`**: Since `j` starts at 1 and the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue if `j < n`. Since `j` is now 2, the condition `j < n` will be true as long as `n` is greater than 2.

6. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: 
   - `j` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 2 (since `j` is now 2 and the loop will continue as long as `n > 2`).

7. **State the final state for the next iteration**: The state of `q[w[j]]` being incremented by 1 does not change the loop condition or the value of `j`, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `n` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1**
