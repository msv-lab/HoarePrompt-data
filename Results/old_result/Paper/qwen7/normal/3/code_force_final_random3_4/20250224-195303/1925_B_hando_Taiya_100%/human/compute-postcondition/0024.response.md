Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n` (where `n = isqrt(x) + 1`).

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 0.
   - `i` is a divisor of `x` plus 1.
   - `isqrt(x) + 1` must be a positive integer.
   - `ans` is the maximum value between the previous `ans` and `x // i`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is a divisor of `x` plus 1, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some divisor of `x` plus 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains `isqrt(x) + 1` because it does not change within the loop.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be the next divisor of `x` plus 1.
   - `n` remains `isqrt(x) + 1`.
   - `ans` remains the same unless `x % i == 0` and `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, but since we are just starting the next iteration, `ans` does not change.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`total` is 0, `i` is a divisor of `x` plus 2, `isqrt(x) + 1` must be a positive integer, and `ans` is the maximum value between the previous `ans` and `x // i`**.
