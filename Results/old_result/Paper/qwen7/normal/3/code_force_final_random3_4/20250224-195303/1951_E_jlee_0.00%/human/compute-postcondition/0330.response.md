Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 3.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.
- `done` is True.
- `count` is 3.

For the `print` statement `print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])`, we need to determine the values of `string[:j - 1]` and `string[j - 1:]`.

Given:
- `j` is 3.
- Therefore, `string[:j - 1]` means `string[:2]`.
- And `string[j - 1:]` means `string[3:]`.

Since the exact content of `string` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact characters in these slices. However, we know the structure of the slices based on the value of `j`.

Output: **string[:2], string[3:]**
