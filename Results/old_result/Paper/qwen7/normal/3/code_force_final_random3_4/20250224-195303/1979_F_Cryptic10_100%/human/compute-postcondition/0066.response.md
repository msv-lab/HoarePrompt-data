Postcondition: `v1` is equal to `len(vx) - 4`; `v2` is equal to `len(vx) - 2`; `vx` has had its `v1` element removed. If `v2 > 0`, then `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`. Otherwise, `ops` is equal to `[('v3', 0), ('len(vx) - 4', 0)]`, `v1` is equal to `len(vx) - 4`, `v2` is equal to `len(vx) - 2`, `vx` does not contain `v3`, and `_` is not used.
