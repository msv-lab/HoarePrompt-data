Output State: **`i` is 5, `diff` is `A[5] - A[4]`, `max_diff` is `A[5] - A[4]`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `max_diff` to be equal to the current value of `diff`. Since `diff` is defined as `A[5] - A[4]`, `max_diff` is now also `A[5] - A[4]`. The values of `i` and `diff` remain unchanged.
