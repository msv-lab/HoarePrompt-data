Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Promotion vs Regular Price Calculation:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd (`if n % 2`).
     - If `n` is odd, it further checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying each yogurt individually.
       - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying individual yogurts is cheaper, so it prints `a * n`.
       - Otherwise, it calculates the cost by buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price: `print(n // 2 * b + a)`.
   - If `n` is even, it directly checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying each yogurt individually.
     - If `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `n // 2 * b`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles all edge cases correctly:
     - When `n` is odd and the promotion price is cheaper for pairs.
     - When `n` is even and the promotion price is cheaper for pairs.
     - When the promotion price is not cheaper, it uses the regular price.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `n` is even and `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`, it prints `2 * 5 = 10`. However, the expected output is `9`.
   - This indicates an error in the logic for even `n`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`, it prints `5 * 3 = 15`. However, the expected output is `14`.
   - This indicates an error in the logic for odd `n`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`, it prints `5 * 3 = 15`. This is correct.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `n` is even and `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`, it prints `4 * 5 = 20`. This is correct.

### Conclusion:

The program has logical errors in handling the cases where the promotion price is cheaper for both even and odd numbers of yogurts. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
