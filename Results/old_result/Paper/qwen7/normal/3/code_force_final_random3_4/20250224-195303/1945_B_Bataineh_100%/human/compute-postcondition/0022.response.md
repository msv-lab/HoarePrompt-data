Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers where `a`, `b`, and `m` are assigned values from the input split into integers.**

The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial conditions for `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
