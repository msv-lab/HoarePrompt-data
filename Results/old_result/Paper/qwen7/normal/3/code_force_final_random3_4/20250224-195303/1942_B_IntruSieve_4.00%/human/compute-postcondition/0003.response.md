Output State: **`mex` is an empty list, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 (and its value is input from the user), `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `minn` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `minn = 0` initializes the variable `minn` to 0. The values of `mex`, `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
