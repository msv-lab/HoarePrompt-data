Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `_` is t, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer**.

The code initializes the variable `i` to 0. The other variables (`cnt`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
