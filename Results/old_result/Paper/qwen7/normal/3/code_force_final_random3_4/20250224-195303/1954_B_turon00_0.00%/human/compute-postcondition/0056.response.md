Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. Since `ans` and `cnt` were not previously defined in the initial state, they are assumed to be initialized to some values before this line of code is executed. However, their exact values are not specified, so we only know that `ans` is now the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
