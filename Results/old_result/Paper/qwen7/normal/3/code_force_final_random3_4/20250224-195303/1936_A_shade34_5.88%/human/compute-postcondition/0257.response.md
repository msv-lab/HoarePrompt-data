Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `pans`, which is `2n - 1`, `mak` is equal to `2n - 1`, and `pans` is a list containing all integers from `n` to `2n - 1` inclusive. The value of `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called for each iteration of the loop.**

This output state indicates that the variables `i`, `mak`, and `pans` retain their values from the end of the loop, and the `sys.stdout.flush()` method has been called for each iteration, ensuring that the output is flushed to the standard output after each iteration.
