Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `count + 1`, `done` is True, `count` is equal to `j`, and `count2` is either greater than or equal to `count` (if `count` > 1) or 0 (otherwise).**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the initial state and no changes to the variables were made within the scope of the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
