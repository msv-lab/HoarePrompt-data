The function processes multiple inputs where each input consists of an integer `n` and a string `s`. It checks specific conditions based on the value of `n` and the content of `s`. If `n` is 2 and `s` is '00', it prints 'YES'. For other values of `n`, it counts the number of '1's in `s`. If the count of '1's is odd or if there is exactly one occurrence of '11' and the count of '1's is 2, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked.
