The function reads an integer `n` and a binary string `a` of length `n`. It then constructs a list `S` where each element contains the counts of '0's and '1's encountered up to that point in the string `a`. After processing the string, it finds and prints the index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `i` and `n/2`, while ensuring that the number of '0's and '1's on both sides of `i` meet specific conditions.
