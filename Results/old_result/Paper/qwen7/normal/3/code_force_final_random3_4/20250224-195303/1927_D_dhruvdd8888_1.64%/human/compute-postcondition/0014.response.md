Output State: **`N` is a valid integer input, `arr` now contains a new tuple `(4, i, num)`, `num` is equal to `nums[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `num = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `num`. Since `arr` now contains a new tuple `(2 + s, i, num)` and `s` is equal to `i`, the tuple becomes `(2 + i, i, num)`, which simplifies to `(4, i, num)`. The value of `num` remains unchanged from its previous state, which was equal to `nums[i]`. All other variables and conditions remain the same as the initial state.
