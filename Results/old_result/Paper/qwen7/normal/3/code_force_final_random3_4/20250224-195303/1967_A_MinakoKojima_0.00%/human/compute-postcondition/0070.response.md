Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n - 1`.
   - `n` is the first integer input.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `i < n`.

4. **Check the current state**:
   - `i` is currently `n - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is `n - 1`, the loop will execute exactly once (if `n > 0`).
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be greater than 0.

6. **Consider other variables**:
   - `a`, `k`, `t`, `ans`, `m`, and `next_input` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly. They can remain as they are.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
