Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `k` is `0`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * 0 + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * 0 + sp`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`. If `bm > sm`, then `bm` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `bm` equals `sm`.**
