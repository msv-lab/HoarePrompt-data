Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is either `n-1` or any value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` contains the element `n`, `s` is an input string, `s` is not equal to `<`, and the current value of `s` is equal to `=`**

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Given that `i` is initially `n`, after appending, `pans` will contain `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state except for `i`, which is decremented by 1 (since `i` was `n` and now it becomes `n-1`).
