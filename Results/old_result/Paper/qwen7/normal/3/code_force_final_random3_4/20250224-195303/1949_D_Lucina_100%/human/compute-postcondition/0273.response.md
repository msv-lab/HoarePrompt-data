Output State: **`i` is 1, `sb` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is 0 for all `i` from 1 to `n+1`, `b` is a list of integers where `b[i] is 0 for all `i` from 1 to `n+1`, `n` is the original value it started with (greater than or equal to 3), `xx` is an empty list, `j` is `n`, `sa` is an empty list, `nx` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The line `nx = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `nx`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `sb`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `xx`, `j`, and `sa` remain unchanged.
