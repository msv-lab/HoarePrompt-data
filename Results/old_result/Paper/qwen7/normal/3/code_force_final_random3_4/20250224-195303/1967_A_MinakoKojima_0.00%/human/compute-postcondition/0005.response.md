Postcondition: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer input followed by a space and then the second integer `k`, `a` is a list containing two integers, the first one is `n` and the second one is `k`, `m` is the minimum of `n` and `k`, and the current value of `k` is greater than or equal to `n` times `m`.
