Based on the initial state provided:

- `a`, `b`, `c` are integers from input.
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `i` is assigned the value of `t`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'STAIRS'`.

Since the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, and `i` do not affect the output of the `print` statement, the output is solely determined by the string provided within the `print` function.

Output: **'STAIRS'**
