Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9; `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned the values from the input split into integers. The current value of `x` is less than `k - 1`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`.
