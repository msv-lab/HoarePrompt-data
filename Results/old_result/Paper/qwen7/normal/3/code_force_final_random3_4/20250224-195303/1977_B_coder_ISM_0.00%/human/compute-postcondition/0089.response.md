Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, length)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `length`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(1, length)`. This means `i` must be less than `length`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `flag` is 0
   - `i` is 2
   - `length` is 29
   - The current value of `s[i]` is '0'
   - The current value of `s[i - 1]` is '-1'

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `length` remains unchanged at 29.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `length` remains 29.

6. **Final state**:
   - `flag` is still 0 (unchanged).
   - `i` is now 3.
   - `length` is still 29.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`flag` is 0, `i` is 3, `length` is 29**.
