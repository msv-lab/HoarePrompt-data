Output State: **`xx` is a 2D list, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `j + 1`, `nx` is the string that was previously concatenated with 'F'**.

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Since no specific value for `nx` was given initially, we only know that `nx` was previously concatenated with something (if it wasn't '?') and now it has been further modified by appending 'F'. The values of `xx`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
