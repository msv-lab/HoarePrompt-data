Based on the initial state provided, the value of `ans` is determined by iterating through all integers from 1 to \(\lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor\), checking if they are divisors of \(x\), and updating `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and either \(i\) or \(x // i\), provided that \(n \leq x // i\) or \(n \leq i\). After completing the iteration, `ans` holds the largest divisor \(d\) of \(x\) that satisfies the condition.

Given this, the `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the largest divisor of \(x\) such that either \(d\) or \(x / d\) is less than or equal to \(n\).

Output: **ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x such that either d or x/d is less than or equal to n)**
