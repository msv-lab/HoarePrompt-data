Output State: `n` must be at least 8.

Explanation: The loop starts with `j` initialized to 4. For each iteration, `j` increments by 1. After 3 iterations, `j` reaches 7 (since it starts at 4 and increments 3 times). Therefore, for the loop to execute all its iterations, `n` must be at least 8, as the loop continues until `j` reaches `n + 1`.
