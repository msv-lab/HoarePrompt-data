Based on the initial state provided:

- `qs` must contain at least one element.
- `n` is the first element in `qs`.
- `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `n` is the first element of the list `qs`.
2. `res` is a list that contains the result of calling `func_1(n, p)` and appending it to an empty list (or possibly another list, but since no other elements are added to `res`, it only contains the result of `func_1(n, p)`).

The `map(str, res)` function converts the single element in `res` to a string, and `' '.join(...)` joins this string with a space.

Therefore, the output will be the string representation of the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

Output: **'result_of_func_1(n, p)' (where result_of_func_1(n, p) is the string representation of the result of the function call func_1(n, p))**
