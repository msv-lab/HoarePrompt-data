Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l < h`.
2. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `l` and `h`.
3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `l < h` must still hold true.

Given the postconditions:
- `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`
- `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`
- `h` is either `mid` or `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`
- `l` is the index such that all elements in `D` before index `l` are less than `left - f`, and `l` is the smallest index where `D[l]` is greater than or equal to `left - f`, and `l` is less than `h`
- `l` is updated based on the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`

To ensure the loop continues, we need to maintain the condition `l < h`. This means both `l` and `h` should be such that `l < h` holds true.

Since `l` and `h` are the only variables in the loop head, and the loop will continue as long as `l < h`, we need to ensure that `l` is less than `h`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the states such that `l` is less than `h`.

**State:**
- `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`
- `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`
- `h` is either `mid` or `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`
- `l` is the index such that all elements in `D` before index `l` are less than `left - f`, and `l` is the smallest index where `D[l]` is greater than or equal to `left - f`, and `l` is less than `h`

In summary, the state at the end of the previous iteration needs to be modified to ensure that `l` is less than `h`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is either `mid` or `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` is the index such that all elements in `D` before index `l` are less than `left - f`, and `l` is the smallest index where `D[l]` is greater than or equal to `left - f`, and `l` is less than `h`**
