Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over the variable `itm` which takes values from the list `mex`.

2. **Understand the Purpose of the Loop:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that `itm` will take each element of the list `mex` one by one.

3. **Determine the Initial State Needed:**
   - Since the loop iterates over `mex`, the initial state must include the list `mex` and the variable `itm`.
   - We need to ensure that `mex` is a list and `itm` is set to the first element of `mex` for the first iteration.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - The state before the loop starts should reflect that `itm` is set to the first element of `mex` and `mex` is a list containing all the required values as described.

Given this analysis, the state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`mex` is a list containing all the values of `minn` updated during each iteration where `arr[i] > 0`, and the absolute differences between `arr[i]` and `minn` when `arr[i] <= 0`, `itm` is the first element of `mex`**.
