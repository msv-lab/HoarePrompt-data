Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `j` is 1; `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q[w[j]]` by 1. Given that `j` is 1, `w[j]` refers to `w[1]`. Therefore, `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
