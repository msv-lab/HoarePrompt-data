Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `input_value` must be a positive integer, `n` is the converted integer value of the first split value from input, `k` is the converted integer value of the second split value from input, `pb` is now the final value obtained after all iterations of the loop, `ps` is the converted integer value of the fourth split value from input, `p` is a list containing `[a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]]`, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]` repeated as many times as the loop iterated, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for index `pb - 1` which is set to 1, and `vis` is now `[1, 0, 0, ..., 0]` (with 1 at index `pb - 1` and 0s elsewhere), `vis[ps - 1]` is now equal to 1.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    paths.append(a[ps - 1])
    ps = p[ps - 1]
    if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `input_value` must be a positive integer, `n` is the converted integer value of the first split value from input, `k` is the converted integer value of the second split value from input, `pb` is now the final value obtained after all iterations of the loop, `ps` is the converted integer value of the fourth split value from input, `p` is a list containing `[a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]]`, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]` repeated as many times as the loop iterated, `paths` is a list containing the element `a[ps - 1]`, `vis` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for index `pb - 1` which is set to 1, `vis` is now `[1, 0, 0, ..., 0]` (with 1 at index `pb - 1` and 0s elsewhere), `ps` is the value of `p[3]`. Additionally, the value of `vis[ps - 1]` is equal to 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`input_value` must be a positive integer, `n` is the converted integer value of the first split value from input, `k` is the converted integer value of the second split value from input, `pb` is now the final value obtained after all iterations of the loop, `ps` is the converted integer value of the fourth split value from input, `p` is a list containing `[a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]]`, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]` repeated as many times as the loop iterated, `paths` is a list containing the element `a[ps - 1]` appended to it, `vis` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for index `pb - 1` which is set to 1, `vis` is now `[1, 0, 0, ..., 0]` (with 1 at index `pb - 1` and 0s elsewhere), `ps` is the value of `p[3]`, and `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`. If `vis[ps - 1] == 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `input_value` must be a positive integer, `n` is the converted integer value of the first split value from input, `k` is the converted integer value of the second split value from input, `pb` is now the final value obtained after all iterations of the loop, `ps` is the converted integer value of the fourth split value from input, `p` is a list containing `[a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]]`, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]` repeated as many times as the loop iterated, `paths` is a list containing the element `a[ps - 1]` appended to it, `vis` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for index `pb - 1` which is set to 1, `vis` is now `[1, 0, 0, ..., 0]` (with 1 at index `pb - 1` and 0s elsewhere), `ps` is now equal to `a[ps - 1]`, `paths` has been appended with `a[ps - 1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
