Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `c`, which is being initialized and incremented within the loop. The loop runs from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `c`**: Since the loop starts with `c` being assigned the value of `ord('a')`, the initial state of `c` should be `ord('a')`.

3. **Check if the Loop Can Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `c` is less than or equal to `ord('z') + 1`. Therefore, `c` must be in the range `[ord('a'), ord('z') + 1)`.

4. **Adjust the States**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `c`, which should be set to `ord('a')` at the start of the loop.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`c` is `ord('a')`**

This ensures that the loop can start executing correctly.
