Output State: **`c` is decreased by 3, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `cntl[2]` is less than 2, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `n`. The values of `c`, `j`, `n` (original), and `cntl[2]` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new value of `n` is an integer obtained from user input.
