Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum balance of a problemset, which is defined as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of all sub-problems. The goal is to split the total difficulty \(x\) into \(n\) sub-problems such that the GCD of these sub-problems is maximized.

2. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. It then reads the values of \(x\) and \(n\) for each test case and calculates the maximum balance.

3. The function `func_1()` iterates through all integers from 1 to \(\lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor\). For each integer \(i\), it checks if \(i\) is a divisor of \(x\). If \(i\) is a divisor, it checks whether \(n \leq x // i\) or \(n \leq i\). This ensures that the sub-problems' difficulties are feasible given the constraint \(n\).

4. The variable `ans` is updated to store the maximum divisor found during the iteration. This approach works because the GCD of \(x\) divided by any of its divisors will always be at least as large as the divisor itself.

5. Finally, the function prints the maximum balance found for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
