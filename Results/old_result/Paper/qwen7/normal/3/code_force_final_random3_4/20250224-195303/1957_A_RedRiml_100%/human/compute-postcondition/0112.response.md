Output State: **`ln` is an input integer, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `d` is a dictionary where the count of each element in `palka` is stored, `pl` is an empty list, `palka` is updated to a list of integers obtained from input, `_` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `pl = []` initializes `pl` as an empty list. This operation does not affect the values of `ln`, `shapes`, `d`, `palka`, or `_`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as described in the initial state, except that `pl` is now an empty list.
