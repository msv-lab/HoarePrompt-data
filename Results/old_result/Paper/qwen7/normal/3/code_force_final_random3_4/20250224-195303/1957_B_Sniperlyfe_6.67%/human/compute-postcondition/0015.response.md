Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. It initializes a list `nums` of length `n` where each element is set to the maximum value that can be represented with `k`'s bit length minus one. It then reduces `k` by the sum of all values in `nums` and increments the last element of `nums` by the final value of `k`. The function returns the modified list `nums`.**
