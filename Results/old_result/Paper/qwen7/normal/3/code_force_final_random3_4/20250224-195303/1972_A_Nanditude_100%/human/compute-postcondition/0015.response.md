Postcondition: `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 0. If the current value of `b[j]` (which is `b[0]`) is less than the current value of `a[i]` (which is `a[0]`), then `cnt` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.
