Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is 0
- `i` is the last element in the list `tab`
- `n` is 0
- `k` is 0
- `rep` is 60
- `Min` is 0
- `Max` is 0
- `number` is 0
- `tab` is a list that must have at least one element

The code snippet `print(i, end=' ')` will print the value of `i`, which is the last element in the list `tab`. Since `tab` must have at least one element, `i` will be the last element of this list.

Output: **the last element in the list tab**
