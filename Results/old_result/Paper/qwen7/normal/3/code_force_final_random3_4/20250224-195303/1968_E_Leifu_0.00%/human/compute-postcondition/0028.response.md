Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop is defined as: `for j in range(4, n + 1):`
- We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is within the range `[4, n+1)`. This means `j` should be less than `n+1`.

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- We don't have explicit values for `j` and `n` from the problem statement, but we know that the loop just finished an iteration. Let's assume the loop just finished with some value of `j` and `n`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Determine the Value of `j` at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - Since the loop just finished, `j` was the last value it took before the loop condition failed (i.e., `j` was equal to `n`).

2. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and checked against `n+1`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `n` (the value it had at the end of the previous iteration) plus 1, making it `n + 1`.

### Conclusion:
- The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `j` is now `n + 1` and `n` remains the same.

### Final Answer:
State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `n` is the same as before**.

If we want to provide specific values, we would need the value of `n` from the previous iteration. However, since the exact value of `n` is not given, the general form is sufficient.

State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `n` is the same as before**.
