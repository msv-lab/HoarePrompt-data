Output State: `power` is 4, `n` must be greater than 8, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is not equal to 1.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `power` by 1 as long as `power` is less than the base-2 logarithm of `n`. From the given information, we can see that after 3 iterations, `power` is 3 and `n` must be greater than 4. Each iteration increments `power` by 1. Therefore, after 4 iterations, `power` will be 4. For the loop to continue for 4 iterations, `n` must be greater than \(2^3 = 8\). All other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and the condition that `n` is not equal to 1) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
