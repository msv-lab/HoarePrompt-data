Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is `n - Min * Max * 59`, `k` is `k - 59 * (min(n // k, k))`, `rep` is 60, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` repeated 60 times, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the final iteration, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the final iteration, and `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k` for the final iteration.**
