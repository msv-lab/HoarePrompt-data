Output State: **`i` is `len(paths) + 2`, `k` is an integer less than `len(paths) + 1`, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` to the variable `curr`. Here, `i` is `len(paths) + 2` and `k` is an integer less than `len(paths) + 1`. Since no other variables are affected, their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `curr` based on the given expressions.
