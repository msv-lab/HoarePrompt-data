Output State: **`flag` remains False, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), and `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`, `val` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `cnt` is 0, and `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`.**

In this case, the code updates `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is 0, `ans` will be updated to 0 if `ans` was previously greater than 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
