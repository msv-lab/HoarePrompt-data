Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100; `n` is the first integer input followed by a space and then the second integer `k`; `a` is a list containing two integers, the first one is `n` and the second one is `k`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into two parts using space as a delimiter, converts each part to an integer, and stores them in a list `a`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `k` is now the second integer input after `n`. Therefore, `a` is a list containing these two integers.
