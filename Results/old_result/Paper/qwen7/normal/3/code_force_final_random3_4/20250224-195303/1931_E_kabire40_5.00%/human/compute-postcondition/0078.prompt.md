Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `rev_val` is an empty list, `y` is `n`, `max_power` is the second input value, `list_len` is the first input value, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the string `x`. If the length of `x` is equal to the length of the string representation of `x_rev`, then `rev_res` is incremented by `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the first string in the list. If the length of `x_rev` as a string is equal to the length of the first string in `operational_list`, `rev_res` is equal to `rev_res` plus `x_rev`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of the first string in `operational_list`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `operational_list` is a list of strings, `x` is the next string in the list, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`, `rev_res` is either `rev_res` plus `x` or unchanged, and `rev_val` is either the list with the reversed string of `x` appended or unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
