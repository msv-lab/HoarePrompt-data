Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1 + 1`, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - i`, and `ans` is either 0 or the value that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, ensuring that the condition `(left * 2 >= lsum) and (right * 2 >= rsum)` still holds true, and if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is smaller than the current `ans`, then `ans` is updated to `i`.

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `i` is incremented by 2, `left` remains as `S[i][0]`, `lsum` remains as `i`, `right` remains as `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` remains as `n - i`, and `ans` is updated to `i` if the new `i` provides a smaller absolute difference with `n / 2`, while maintaining the condition `(left * 2 >= lsum) and (right * 2 >= rsum)`.
