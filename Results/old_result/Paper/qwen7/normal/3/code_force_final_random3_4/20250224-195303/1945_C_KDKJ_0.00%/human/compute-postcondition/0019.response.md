Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1'; `S` is a list containing a sublist [x+1, y] or [x, y+1] depending on the last character of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `S.append([x, y])` appends a new sublist `[x, y]` to the list `S`. The values of `x` and `y` are determined based on the last character of the string `a`. If the last character of `a` is '0', `x` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `y` is incremented by 1. Since the exact value of `a` is not specified, we express the updated values of `x` and `y` in terms of their original values plus 1, depending on the last character of `a`. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
