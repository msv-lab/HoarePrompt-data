Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, and `n` is even; `s` is '110110...110' (repeated `n//2` times)**

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the value `'110' * (n // 2)`. Since `n` is even, `n // 2` will be a positive integer. Therefore, `s` will be the string `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times. The conditions on `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
