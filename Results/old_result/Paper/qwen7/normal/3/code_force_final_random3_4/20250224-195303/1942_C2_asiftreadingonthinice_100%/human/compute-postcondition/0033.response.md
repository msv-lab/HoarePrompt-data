Postcondition: **After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 1`. The variable `ans` will be incremented by 1 each time the difference between consecutive elements in the list `a` is exactly 2. The variable `tmp` will contain the half of the difference between consecutive elements in `a` whenever this difference is even but not 2. The sum of the first element `a[0]` and the value of `n` is 2 more than the last element `a[len(a) - 1]`**.
