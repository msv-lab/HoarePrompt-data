Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`. If `n` equals 2, `s` is either '00' or not '00'. Otherwise, `count_1` is the number of '1's in `s`, and if `count_1` is odd, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If `count_1` is even, `count_1` is even, and either `s.count('11') == 1` and `count_1 == 2`, or `s.count('11') != 1` or `count_1 != 2`.
