Output State: **`max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is still 1, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is `x - 1`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 1)`, `current_sum` is `math.gcd(x, x - 1) + y**.

Explanation: The line `max_sum = current_sum` updates the value of `max_sum` to be the same as `current_sum`. All other variables (`best_y`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
