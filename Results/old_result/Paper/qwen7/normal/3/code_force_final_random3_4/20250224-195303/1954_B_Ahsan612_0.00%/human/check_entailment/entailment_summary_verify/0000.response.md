### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the program does not correctly solve the problem.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful.
   - A beautiful array allows us to perform the operation: choose an index \(i\) (where \(2 \le i \le n-1\)) such that \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\), and replace \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\).

2. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function summary states that the function calculates the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number.
   - This summary does not reflect the actual logic implemented in the program, which is incorrect for the problem.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The program iterates through the array and counts the lengths of consecutive segments of the same number.
   - It then finds the minimum length among these segments.
   - If the minimum length is infinite (`inf`), it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length.

4. **Example Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the test case `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`:
     - The program correctly identifies the minimum segment length as `1`.
     - However, the correct answer should be `1` because removing the `2` at index `2` makes the array non-beautiful.
   - For the test case `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`:
     - The program identifies the minimum segment length as `3`.
     - However, the correct answer should be `3` because removing the `5` and one of the `3`s (any one will do) makes the array non-beautiful.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not account for the optimal strategy of removing elements to break the beauty condition.
   - It only calculates the minimum length of consecutive segments, which is not sufficient to solve the problem.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
