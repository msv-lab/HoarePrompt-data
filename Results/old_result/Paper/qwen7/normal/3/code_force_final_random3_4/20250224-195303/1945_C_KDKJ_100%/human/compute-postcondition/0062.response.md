Postcondition: `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2; `left` equals `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`; `ans` remains unchanged unless the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, in which case `ans` is updated to `i`.
