To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head and the given conditions step by step.

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop head is:
```python
while i < len(ar):
```
This means the loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `ar`.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `minn` is 1
- `same` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `ar[i-1]` equals `num`
- `num` is either `ar[0]` or `ar[i-1]` based on the condition
- `ar` is updated with integers from the input
- `n` is an input integer
- `i` is either 2 or 4
- `same` is set to 1 in the else part

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `i < len(ar)`.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: `i` is either 2 or 4.
3. **Length of `ar`**: We need to know the length of `ar` to determine if the loop can continue. However, the length of `ar` is not directly provided in the given states.

Given that `i` is either 2 or 4, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(ar)` for the loop to execute one more time.

### Determining the Adjustment
- If `i` is 2, then `i < len(ar)` implies `len(ar) > 2`.
- If `i` is 4, then `i < len(ar)` implies `len(ar) > 4`.

Since `i` is either 2 or 4, the minimum requirement for the loop to execute one more time is `len(ar) > 4`.

### Adjusted States
- `i` must be 4 (since 2 would not allow the loop to execute again if `len(ar) <= 4`).
- `len(ar)` must be greater than 4.

### Final Answer
State: **`minn` is 1, `same` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `ar[i-1]` equals `num`, `num` is either `ar[0]` or `ar[i-1]` based on the condition, `ar` is updated with integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 4, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 4**.
