### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given array to make it non-beautiful.
   - An array is considered beautiful if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Operation Explanation:**
   - The operation involves choosing an index \(i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq |a| - 1\)) such that \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\), and replacing \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\).

3. **Key Observation:**
   - For an array to be beautiful, there must be at least one sequence where the elements alternate in a way that allows the operation to be performed indefinitely.

4. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - The function `func()` reads the input and processes the array to find the minimum number of elements to remove.
   - It initializes `same` to count consecutive occurrences of the same element and `minn` to track the minimum length of such sequences.
   - The loop iterates through the array, updating `same` and `num` when a different element is encountered.
   - After the loop, it checks if `minn` is still infinity (`inf`) and prints `-1` if no such sequence exists, otherwise, it prints `minn`.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in the code correctly identifies the minimum length of sequences where the array could potentially remain beautiful.
   - However, the code does not fully address the requirement to ensure the array stops being beautiful after removals.
   - The code only counts the minimum length of such sequences but does not account for removing elements to break these sequences.

6. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - For the given examples, the code seems to produce the correct results, but it might fail in more complex scenarios where the array structure is more intricate.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem because it only counts the minimum length of sequences where the array could remain beautiful, without ensuring that removing elements breaks these sequences. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
