Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `not_mid - 1`
- `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `clique`
- `arr[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `big_element - i`

### Loop Statement
```
for i in range(not_mid):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = not_mid - 1`.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `not_mid - 1`.

### Next Iteration
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be `not_mid`.

### Adjusted States
- `i` is now `not_mid`.
- The values of `cliquess[left + mid + i]` and `arr[left + mid + i]` will be updated in the loop body, but their current states remain unchanged until the loop body is executed.

### Final State
State: **`i` is `not_mid`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `clique`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `big_element - i`**
