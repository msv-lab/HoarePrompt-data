Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`**

Explanation: The code updates `sm` to be the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`. Given that `k` is 0, `a[s] * k + sp` simplifies to `sp`. Since `sp` is already defined as `a[s] + sp`, and `k` is 0, `a[s] * k + sp` is simply `sp`. Therefore, `sm` remains unchanged because it is already the maximum of itself and `sp`. All other variables remain unaffected by this operation.
