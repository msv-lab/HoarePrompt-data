Postcondition: `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` retains its original value, `x` retains its original value, `y` retains its original value, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even, `tmp` remains an empty list otherwise, `i` is 2, `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even.
