Output State: **`i` is `n - 1 + t`, `possible` is True if any character `c[i]` does not match either `a[i]` or `b[i]` for any `i` from 0 to `n - 1`; otherwise, `possible` is False, `a` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().strip()` reads a line of input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `a`. The values of `i`, `n`, `t`, and `possible` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new information is that `a` now holds the input string.
