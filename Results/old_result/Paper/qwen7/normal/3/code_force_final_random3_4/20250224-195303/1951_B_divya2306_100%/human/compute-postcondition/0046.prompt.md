You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The list a is a list of n distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        wins += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `wins` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element from the input split into an integer, `i` is 3.
    #
    #**Explanation**: The loop continues to increment the `wins` variable as long as the condition `a[i] > a[k - 1]` is not met. After the loop has executed 3 times, it means that `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` were all less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`. The loop will continue to execute until `a[i]` becomes greater than `a[k - 1]` or until `i` reaches `n`. Since the loop has already executed 3 times, `i` is now 3. If `a[3]` is not greater than `a[k - 1]`, then `wins` will still be 3 after all iterations of the loop.
    if (wins >= k) :
        print(wins - 1)
        #This is printed: 2
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `wins` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element from the input split into an integer, and `a[3]` is less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`
    win_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        win_with_swap += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `win_with_swap` is equal to `k - 1`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `win_with_swap` as long as `a[i]` is less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` and `i` is less than `k - 1`. After 3 iterations, `win_with_swap` has been incremented 3 times. Since the loop condition checks `i < k - 1`, once `i` reaches `k - 1`, the loop will terminate. Therefore, `win_with_swap` will be set to `k - 1` when the loop finishes. All other variables' states remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))
    #This is printed: k - 1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns None.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
