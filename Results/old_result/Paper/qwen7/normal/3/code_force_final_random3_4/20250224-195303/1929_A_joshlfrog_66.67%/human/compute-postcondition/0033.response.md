Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `e` and `t`.
   - `e` is the loop variable.
   - `t` is the upper limit of the loop.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `e = 0` to `e < t`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
   - `e` is 0.
   - `l` is the length of the `nums` list.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces.
   - `x` is the maximum value found in the `nums` list.
   - `y` is the minimum value found in the `nums` list.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop runs from `e = 0` to `e < t`, if the loop is to execute one more time, `e` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `e` will become 1.
   - The values of `t`, `l`, `nums`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `e` is 1, `l` is the length of the `nums` list, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `x` is the maximum value found in the `nums` list, and `y` is the minimum value found in the `nums` list.**
