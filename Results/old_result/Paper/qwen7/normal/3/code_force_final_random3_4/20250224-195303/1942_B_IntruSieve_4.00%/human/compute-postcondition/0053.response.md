Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `mex` is a list.
   - The third element of `mex` is `itm`.
   - `itm` is also the third element of `mex`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(itm, end=' ')
   ```

Given the initial state, we know that `itm` is the third element of the list `mex`. Since `itm` is explicitly defined as the third element of `mex`, we can directly use this information to determine what will be printed.

Therefore, the output will be the value of the third element of the list `mex`.

Output: **itm (which is the third element of the list mex)**
