### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Digits**: For each test case, it correctly reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIRS' if this condition is met. This is correct according to the problem statement.
4. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met. However, there is a typo in the condition check. It should be `a < b and b > c` instead of `a < b > c`. The current condition `a < b > c` will always evaluate to `True` because `b > c` is checked after `a < b`, which means the condition will always be true if `b` is greater than `c`.
5. **Default Case**: If neither condition is met, the program prints 'NONE'. This handles all other cases correctly.

Given that the program has a logical error in the peak condition check due to the typo, it will incorrectly identify some test cases as 'PEAK' when they should be 'NONE'.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect due to the logical error in the peak condition check.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
