You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 40, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n, and the function `make_array` is defined elsewhere to fill the array `arr` based on the given parameters.
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `cliques` must be at least 1, `i` equals `cliques`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 40\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 2n\), `arr` is a list of `n` zeros, `cliquess` is a list of `n` zeros, `arr` is updated to contain values from `0 * k` to `min((cliques) * k - 1, n - 1)` inclusive, with a length of `cliques`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `cliques` will still be at least 1, `i` will now be equal to the final value of `cliques`, `n` will remain within the range of 2 to 40, `k` will stay within the range of 1 to 2n, `arr` will still be a list of `n` zeros, and `cliquess` will also remain a list of `n` zeros. The `arr` list will be updated to include values starting from `0 * k` up to the minimum of `(cliques * k - 1)` and `n - 1`, with the length of this segment being equal to `cliques`.
    print(*arr)
    #This is printed: [0, 10, ..., min((cliques * k - 1), n - 1)] (where the list starts from 0 * k and ends at the minimum of (cliques * k - 1) and n - 1, with a total of cliques elements)
    print(cliques)
    #This is printed: cliques (where cliques is at least 1)
    print(*cliquess)
    #This is printed: 0 0 0 ... 0 (n times)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 40, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 2n. It calculates the number of cliques (`cliques`) based on these parameters and uses the `make_array` function to fill an array `arr` with specific values. After processing, it prints the updated array `arr`, the number of cliques, and an array of zeros (`cliquess`). The final state of the program includes an updated `arr` containing values from `0 * k` to `min((cliques * k - 1), n - 1)`, a `cliques` value indicating the number of cliques, and a `cliquess` array consisting entirely of zeros.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are integers such that left < right, and clique is an integer representing the clique identifier.
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + i] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: All elements in `arr` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are set to values starting from `small_element` and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent index. The corresponding elements in `cliquess` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are all set to `clique`. The variable `i` will be equal to `mid - 1` after the loop finishes, and both `left` and `right` will retain their original values.
    #
    #In more detail:
    #- `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` will contain the sequence of integers starting from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`.
    #- `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` will all be set to `clique`.
    #- The loop variable `i` will be `mid - 1` after the loop completes.
    #- The variables `left`, `right`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` will retain their initial or updated values from before the loop started, but no further changes will occur within the loop itself.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: The array `arr` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` will contain the sequence of integers starting from `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` to `big_element - 1`. The corresponding elements in `cliquess` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` will all be set to `clique`. The variable `i` will be equal to `not_mid` after the loop finishes, and both `left`, `right`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` will retain their original values from before the loop started.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the elements in `arr` from `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` will be filled with decreasing values starting from `big_element - 1` down to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`, while the corresponding elements in `cliquess` will all be set to `clique`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_array` accepts two integers `left` and `right` (with `left` less than `right`) and an integer `clique` representing a clique identifier. It fills the array `arr` with a specific pattern of values between indices `left` and `right`, inclusive, and sets corresponding elements in the array `cliquess` to the given `clique` identifier. Specifically, it first populates the array segment from `left` to `left + mid - 1` with increasing values starting from `small_element`, and then populates the segment from `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` with decreasing values starting from `big_element`. After executing the function, the array `arr` and the array `cliquess` will reflect these changes, and the variables `left`, `right`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` will retain their original values.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to satisfy the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques based on the given constraints.

Here is a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Partitioning Logic**: The function `func_1` attempts to partition the vertices into cliques by simply dividing the vertices into segments of size `k`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting partition will minimize the number of cliques. For example, consider the case where `n = 5` and `k = 4`. According to the problem, the graph should be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques. A valid partition would be to place all vertices in a single clique since `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j|` will always be less than or equal to `k` for any pair of vertices `(i, j)`.

2. **Example Case**: Let's take the case `n = 5` and `k = 4`. The program will output:
   ```
   1 2 3 4 5
   2
   1 1 1 1 1
   ```
   This partition is incorrect because it places all vertices in a single clique, but the problem requires the minimum number of cliques. A correct partition would be:
   ```
   1 2 3 4 5
   1
   1 1 1 1 1
   ```

3. **General Case**: The function `make_array` does not handle the assignment of values to vertices in a way that ensures the minimum number of cliques. It simply divides the vertices into segments and assigns them to the same clique, which may not be optimal.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
