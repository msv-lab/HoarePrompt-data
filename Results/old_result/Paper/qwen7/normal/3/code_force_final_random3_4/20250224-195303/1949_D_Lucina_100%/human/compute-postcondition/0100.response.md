Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is set to `i_end + 2`, `j` is `j_end + 2`, and the condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` still holds true; `a[j]` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the variable `a[j]` has been incremented by 1. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, and the condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
