The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and then a set of integers from 1 to `n`. It repeatedly removes pairs of integers from the set based on certain conditions and records the operations performed. After processing, it reconstructs the original set and applies the recorded operations in reverse order to produce a final sequence of integers. This sequence is then printed as the result.
