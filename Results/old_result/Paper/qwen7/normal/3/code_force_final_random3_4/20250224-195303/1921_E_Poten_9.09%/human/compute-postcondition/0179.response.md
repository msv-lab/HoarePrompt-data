Postcondition: `test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `answers` is a list. Based on the conditions of the if and else parts, `answers` will contain one of the following:
- If `clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0` or `(clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0)` is true, and `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, based on the comparison of `clues[3]` and `clues[5]`:
  - If `clues[3] < clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then `answers` contains 'Draw'.
  - If `clues[3] < clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1, then `answers` contains 'Bob'.
  - If `clues[3] > clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then `answers` contains 'Draw'.
  - If `clues[3] > clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1, then `answers` contains 'Bob'.
- If the above condition is false, and `clues[3] == clues[5]`, then `answers` contains 'Alice'. Otherwise, based on the comparison of `clues[3]` and `clues[5]`:
  - If `clues[3] < clues[5]` and `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) > 1` is true, `answers` contains 'Draw' if `clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` is true, otherwise `answers` contains 'Alice'.
  - If `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) <= 1` is true, `answers` contains 'Draw' if `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` is true, otherwise `answers` contains 'Alice'.
  - If `clues[3] >= clues[5]` is true, `answers` contains 'Draw' if `clues[3] > clues[5]` and `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) > 1`, otherwise `answers` remains unchanged.
