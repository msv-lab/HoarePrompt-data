Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `r` is `i + 1`; `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2` plus the previous value of `sum`**.

The code updates the `sum` variable by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value. The values of `i` and `r` remain unchanged from their initial state, which is `i + 1`. The `sum` variable now includes the new value added to it.
