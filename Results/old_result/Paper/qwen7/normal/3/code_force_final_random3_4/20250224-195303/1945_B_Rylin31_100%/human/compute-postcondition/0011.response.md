Output State: The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 9999 (since the loop runs from `i` in range(t) and `t` is at most \(10^4\)), and `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces for the last iteration of the loop.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will still hold its initial value as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to `t - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` will be the ones provided by the input for the last iteration of the loop.
