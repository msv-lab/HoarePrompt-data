Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the range for the variable `v`, which iterates from `na_frente` to `-1` in steps of `-1`. The key variables here are `v`, `na_frente`, and `n` (which is implied by the range).

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - **`v`**: This variable starts at `na_frente` and decrements until it reaches `-1`. Therefore, `v` should start at `na_frente` and decrement until it reaches `-1`.
   - **`na_frente`**: This is already given as `na_frente` being the original value minus 2.
   - **`n`**: Although `n` is not explicitly mentioned in the loop head, it is implied by the range `range(na_frente, -1, -1)`. For the loop to execute, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to `-1`.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - We know `total` is 0 and does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `cases` must be greater than 0, but this does not affect the loop directly either.
   - `na_frente` is correctly defined as the original value minus 2.
   - `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1 and does not affect the loop directly.
   - `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers and do not affect the loop directly.
   - `best` is set to the maximum floating-point value and does not affect the loop directly.

Given these points, the only adjustments needed are for `v` to start at `na_frente` and for `na_frente` to be such that the loop can execute (i.e., `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to `-1`).

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`total` is 0, `na_frente` is the original value minus 2, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1, `v` starts at `na_frente` and decrements until it reaches -1**.
