Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `array` is unchanged, `a` is [1], `answer` has an element appended which is `array[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `a[0] += 1` increments the value of `a[0]` by 1. Initially, `a` is `[0]` (implied from the context), so after the operation, `a[0]` becomes `1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `a` becomes `[1]`. The value appended to `answer` remains `array[a[0]]`, which is now `array[1]`.
