Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly determines whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle based on the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Cutting Logic**: For each test case, the program checks if either dimension (`a` or `b`) is even. If at least one dimension is even, it prints 'Yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed. If both dimensions are odd, it prints 'No', indicating that no other rectangle can be formed.
3. **Edge Cases**: The logic handles all edge cases where one or both dimensions are even, ensuring that the program outputs the correct result for every test case.

Given the problem constraints and the examples provided, the program works as intended. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
