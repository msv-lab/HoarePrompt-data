Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(N + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `N`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `N` is a valid integer input.
   - `arr` now contains a new tuple `(4, i, num)`.
   - `num` is equal to `nums[i]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `N + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it iterates, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `N + 1`.

Given that `i` was used in the previous iteration, let's assume `i` was `k` (where `k < N`). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `N` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `arr` will contain a new tuple `(4, k+1, num)`, where `num` is `nums[k+1]`.

So, the updated state for the next iteration is:
- `N` is a valid integer input.
- `arr` now contains a new tuple `(4, i, num)`, where `i` is `k + 1` and `num` is `nums[i]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`N` is a valid integer input, `arr` now contains a new tuple `(4, i, num)`, `num` is equal to `nums[i]` where `i` is `k + 1`**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can generalize it as `i` being incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Final Answer:
State: **`N` is a valid integer input, `arr` now contains a new tuple `(4, i, num)`, `num` is equal to `nums[i]` where `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
