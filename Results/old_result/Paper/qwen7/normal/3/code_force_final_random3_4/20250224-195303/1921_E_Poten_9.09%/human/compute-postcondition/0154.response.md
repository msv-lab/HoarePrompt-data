Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', `clues` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The line `answers.append('Alice')` adds the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. The initial value of `i` is 1, and after executing the line of code, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
