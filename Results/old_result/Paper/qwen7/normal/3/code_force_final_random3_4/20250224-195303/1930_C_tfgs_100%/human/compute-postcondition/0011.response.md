Output State: **`cur` is 0, the value of `i` is `n-1`, for every index `j` in the list `a`, the value of `a[j]` is `2j + 1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `cur` to 0. No changes are made to the values of `i`, the list `a`, or the `counter` object. Therefore, these values remain unchanged from their initial states.
