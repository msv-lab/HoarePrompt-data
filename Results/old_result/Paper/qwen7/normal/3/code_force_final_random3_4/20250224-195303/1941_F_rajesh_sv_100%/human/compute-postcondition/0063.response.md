Postcondition: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is set to `mid` and `l` remains unchanged, ensuring `l` is still the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F` and `l` is less than `h`.**
