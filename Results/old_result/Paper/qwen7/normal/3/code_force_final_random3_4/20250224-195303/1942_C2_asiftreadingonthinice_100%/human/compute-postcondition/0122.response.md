Output State: **`i` is the first element of `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list that must have at least one element, and `ans` is increased by `i`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += i` adds the value of `i` (which is the first element of `tmp`) to `ans`. Since `tmp` is a sorted list and must have at least one element, `i` retains its original value as the first element of `tmp`. The value of `ans` is updated by adding `i` to its current value.
