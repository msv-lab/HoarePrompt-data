Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, v is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9, and p is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**
