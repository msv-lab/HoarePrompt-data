Output State: **`i` is 0; `curr` is `pres` + `paths[0]` * (`k` - 0); `pres` is `pres` + `paths[0]`; `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`**

Explanation: The line `ress = max(ress, curr)` updates `ress` to be the maximum value between its current value and `curr`. Since `curr` is defined as `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`, and `pres` is already updated to `pres + paths[0]`, the value of `curr` remains unchanged from its definition. The values of `i` and `pres` remain the same as their initial states because they are not directly affected by the line of code.
