Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 999 inclusive.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is a new string input from the user.
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the string `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found.
   - `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr`.
   - `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before the index `n - y`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - `print(z.count('0'))`

To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the components of `z`:

- `x` is the index of the first '1' in `arr`.
- `y` is the index of the last '1' in the reversed `arr`, which means it corresponds to the first '1' from the end in the original `arr`.
- `z` is a substring from `x` to `n - y` (exclusive).

Given these definitions, `z` contains a segment of the string `arr` starting from the first '1' and ending just before the position corresponding to the last '1' from the end of the string.

The `count('0')` method counts how many times the character '0' appears in the substring `z`.

Since the exact values of `arr`, `n`, and the positions of '1' are not specified, we cannot determine the exact number of '0's in `z`. However, we can describe the general behavior:

- If `x` is -1 (meaning no '1' is found in `arr`), then `z` would be an empty string, and `z.count('0')` would be 0.
- Otherwise, `z` will contain a segment of `arr` starting from the first '1' and ending just before the position corresponding to the last '1' from the end. The count of '0's in this segment depends on the content of `arr`.

Thus, the output will be the count of '0's in the substring `z`.

Output: **z.count('0') (where z is the substring of arr starting from the first occurrence of '1' and ending just before the position corresponding to the last occurrence of '1' from the end)**
