Output State: **`k` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is 0, `res[c]` is 0, `l` is 4, `c` is 3**

Explanation: The value of `l` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 (if the character at index 1 of `s` was 'L') or 3 (if the character at index 1 of `s` was not 'L') to 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
