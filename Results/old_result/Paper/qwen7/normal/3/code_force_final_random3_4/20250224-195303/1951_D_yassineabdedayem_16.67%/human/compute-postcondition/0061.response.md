Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the input, `k` is the integer value of the second space-separated token from the input, `t` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `k - 59 * (min(n // k, k))` is calculated using the new value of `n` and `k`, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the final iteration, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the final iteration, and `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k` for the final iteration.**

Explanation: The code initializes `tab` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `rep`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `number`, `Min`, `Max`, or the calculation of `k - 59 * (min(n // k, k))`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states.
