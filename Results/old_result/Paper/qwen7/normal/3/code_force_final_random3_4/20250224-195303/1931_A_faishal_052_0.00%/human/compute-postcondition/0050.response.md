Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, printing the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' (assuming `lex` is 26, making `arr` = [1, 1, 26]).

Explanation: Since the loop runs for 3 iterations, it prints the characters corresponding to the values in `arr` after adding 96 to each element. With `arr` containing [1, 1, 26], the characters printed are 'a', 'a', and 'z'. Therefore, the final output state is the completion of the loop with these characters printed.
