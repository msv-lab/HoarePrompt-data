Output State: **`i` is 6, `diff` is `A[6] - A[5]`, `max_diff` is equal to `diff`, `next_max_diff` is equal to `max_diff`, `index` is 6**

Explanation: The line `index = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 6) to the variable `index`. No other changes occur to the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `diff`, `max_diff`, and `next_max_diff` remain unchanged, and `index` is set to 6.
