Reasoning:
1. The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the required number of special characters.
3. The logic to check if `n` is odd is correct because if `n` is odd, it's impossible to have exactly `n` special characters since each special character must have exactly one neighbor that is different, which would require an even number of special characters.
4. The construction of the string `s` using '110' repeated `n // 2` times is a valid approach to ensure that each character (except the first and last) has exactly one neighbor that is different, making them special. This ensures that the number of special characters is `n`.
5. The condition `if len(s) < 200:` checks if the generated string is within the allowed length, and if so, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. If the length exceeds 200, it prints 'NO', which is also correct based on the problem constraints.

Given the above points, the provided code appears to meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
