Output State: **`resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `preb + pathb[2] * (k - 2)`, `i` is 3, `preb` is `preb + pathb[2]`.**

Explanation: The line `resb = max(resb, curr)` updates `resb` to be the maximum of its current value and `curr`. Given that `curr` is defined as `preb + pathb[2] * (k - 2)`, and `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[2]`, the value of `preb` remains `preb + pathb[2]` after the line of code is executed. The values of `i` and `curr` are not directly affected by this line of code, so they remain as initially stated.
