Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `number` is either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, and `Max` is adjusted based on whether `n * Min <= k` or not. If `n * Min <= k`, then `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k) - k`; otherwise, `Max` is `k - min(n // k, k)`**.

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated by subtracting `Min * Max` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
