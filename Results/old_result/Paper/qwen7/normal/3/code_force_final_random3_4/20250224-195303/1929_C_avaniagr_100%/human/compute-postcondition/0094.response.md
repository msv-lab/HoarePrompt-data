Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the next line `s`, `x` is the integer value of the second space-separated token from the next line `s`, `a` is the integer value of the third space-separated token from the next line `s`, and `z` is the result of:
- If `x == k - 1`, then `z` is `k - 1` plus the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 1 to either `x - k + 3` or `x - k + 2` depending on whether `a >= z` is true or false.
- Otherwise, `z` is the result of repeatedly adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to itself, starting from the initial value of `k - 2`, for a total of `x - k + 3` times.
