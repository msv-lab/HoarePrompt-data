Output State: `mid` and `h` will be such that `l` is no longer less than `h`. This means the loop has terminated because the condition `l < h` is no longer satisfied. During the last iteration, `mid` was calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, and depending on the comparison between `mid_sum - left` and `right - mid_next_sum`, either `mid` was updated to `mid + 1` and `h` was set to `mid`, or `h` was updated to `mid`. The values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` will be those corresponding to the final `mid` value. The variables `total` and `students` remain undefined as they were not affected by the loop.
