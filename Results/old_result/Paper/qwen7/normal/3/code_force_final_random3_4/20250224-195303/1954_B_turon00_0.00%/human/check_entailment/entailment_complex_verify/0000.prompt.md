You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and the given array a is beautiful. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.

        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        tmp = a[0]
        
        aa = set(a)
        
        if len(aa) == 1:
            print(-1)
        
        cnt = 0
        
        ans = n
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == tmp:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                ans = min(ans, cnt)
                cnt = 0
        
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` will be 0, `ans` will be the minimum value among all calculated `cnt` values across all test cases, `tmp` will be the first element of the list `a` from the last test case processed, `aa` will be a set containing all unique elements from the list `a` of the last test case, and `n` will be the length of the list `a` from the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and implicitly an integer `t`. For each test case, it determines if the list `a` is beautiful (i.e., all elements are the same). If `a` is beautiful, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the first element in `a` and prints this value. The function outputs the minimum such count across all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing the correct elements. Here’s a detailed explanation:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Array Removal Logic**: The program attempts to count the consecutive occurrences of the first element (`tmp`) and then finds the minimum count among these segments. However, this approach does not account for the possibility of removing elements in a way that breaks the beauty condition without necessarily having the longest segment of identical elements.

2. **Example Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the input: `5 1 2 1 2 1`. According to the problem, the correct answer should be `1` because removing the second element (which is `2`) makes the array `[1, 1, 2, 1]`, which is no longer beautiful.
   - The program, however, would incorrectly output `3` because it counts the maximum segment of identical elements (`1` appears three times consecutively), and it removes the minimum of these segments, which is `1`.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, you need to identify the longest segment of identical elements and then calculate the number of elements that need to be removed to break the beauty condition. This involves checking the transitions between different elements and determining the minimum number of removals needed to ensure no two adjacent elements are equal.

Since the provided program does not handle the problem correctly for certain cases, the correctness is **False**.
