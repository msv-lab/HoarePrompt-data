Output State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `suits` dictionary keys are set to `None`, `answers` is a list containing 16 unique strings, each formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump', and `trumps` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `trumps = sorted(trumps)` attempts to sort the `trumps` list. However, since `trumps` is initially an empty list, calling `sorted()` on an empty list does not change its contents. Therefore, `trumps` remains an empty list after executing the code. The other variables (`suits` and `answers`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
