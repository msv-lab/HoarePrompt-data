Output State: **`operations` is 5, `heap` has had its smallest element replaced with `smallest + 1`, and `smallest` is the new value after removing the smallest element from the heap.**

Explanation: The variable `operations` was initially set to 4. After executing `operations += 1`, the value of `operations` is incremented by 1, making it 5. The values of `heap` and `smallest` remain unchanged from their initial state, as no operations were performed on them within the given code snippet.
