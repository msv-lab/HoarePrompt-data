Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `ar` minus `n`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `same` is 1, `num` is the last element of `ar` if it was not equal to the previous `num` when the loop ended, otherwise, `same` can take any value from 1 to the maximum value of `same` observed during the loop, `ar` is updated with integers from the input, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The line `same = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `same`. This updates the value of `same` but does not affect any other variables or their relationships. Therefore, the output state retains all the initial conditions except that `same` is now explicitly set to 1.
