### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. The beauty is maximized by arranging the array in such a way that the positive differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array elements.
   - It calls `func_1(n, arr)` to compute the maximum beauty.
   - `func_1` sorts the array and then alternately appends the smallest and largest remaining elements to `new_arr`. This approach aims to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Checking the Logic in `func_1`**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest and largest elements are considered first.
   - By alternating between the smallest and largest elements, the function tries to create the largest possible differences between consecutive elements.
   - The loop calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

4. **Validation**:
   - The logic in `func_1` seems to follow the strategy of maximizing differences by alternating between the smallest and largest elements.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation. When `left` equals `right`, the code appends `arr[left]` to `new_arr`, but it does not handle the case where the array has an odd number of elements properly. This can lead to incorrect results when the array has an odd length.

### Example to Illustrate the Flaw:
Consider the array `[1, 2, 3]`:
- After sorting, `arr` is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- `left` starts at 0 and `right` starts at 2.
- The loop will append `3` and `1` to `new_arr`, resulting in `new_arr = [3, 1]`.
- The beauty calculation will be `abs(1 - 3) = 2`, which is correct.
- However, the original array had three elements, and the correct `new_arr` should be `[1, 3]` to ensure the middle element is placed correctly.

### Corrected Implementation:
To fix this, we need to ensure that the middle element (if the array length is odd) is placed correctly. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    # Ensure the middle element is placed correctly if n is odd
    if len(new_arr) % 2 != 0:
        new_arr.pop()
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
    return max_beauty
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate in identifying the general logic but overlooked the handling of arrays with an odd number of elements. The provided solution needs a minor adjustment to correctly handle the middle element.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
