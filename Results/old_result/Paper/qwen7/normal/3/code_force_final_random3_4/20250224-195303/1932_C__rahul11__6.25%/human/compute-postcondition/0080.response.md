Postcondition: `s` is a string, `k` is an index within the string `s`, `ans` is the result of either `ans // arr[l] % MOD` (if the character at index `k` in string `s` is 'L') or `ans // arr[r] % MOD` (if the character at index `k` in string `s` is not 'L'), `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is increased by 1 if the character at index `k` is 'L', and `r` is decreased by 1 if the character at index `k` is not 'L'.
