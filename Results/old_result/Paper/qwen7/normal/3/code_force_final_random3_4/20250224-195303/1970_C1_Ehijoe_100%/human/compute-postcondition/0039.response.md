Output State: **`ends` is a list of all keys from the dictionary `nodes` whose corresponding value lists have a length of exactly one; `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the list `ends`, respectively; `tree` is a list containing the elements `s` and `curr`; `prev` is equal to `s`; `curr` is the first element of `nodes[s]` and must not be equal to `e`; `tree` has been appended with `curr`.**

This means that the `tree` list has been updated by appending the current node (`curr`) to it, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states except for `tree`.
