Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50. Based on these values, the function returns a specific output without explicitly being defined in the given snippet.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return value are not specified in the given snippet, so the functionality focuses on the constraints and the fact that the function processes two integers within specified ranges.
