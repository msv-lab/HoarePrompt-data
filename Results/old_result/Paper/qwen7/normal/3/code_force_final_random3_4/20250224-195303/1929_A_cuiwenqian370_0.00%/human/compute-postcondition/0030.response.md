Output State: `left` is `n - 1`, `right` is `n - 1`, and `new_arr` is a list containing all elements from `arr` but in a mirrored order.

To understand this, let's break down the loop:

- The loop continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`.
- If `left` equals `right`, it means there's only one element left between `left` and `right`, so that element is appended to `new_arr`.
- Otherwise, the elements at `right` and `left` are appended to `new_arr`, and then both `left` and `right` are adjusted to move towards the center of the array.

After the loop completes, `left` will be equal to `right` and will be the last index where elements were processed. At this point, `new_arr` will contain all elements from the original array but in a mirrored order.
