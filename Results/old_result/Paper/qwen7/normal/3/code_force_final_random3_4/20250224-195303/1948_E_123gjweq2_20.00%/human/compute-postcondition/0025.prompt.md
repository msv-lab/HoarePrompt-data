Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: All elements in `arr` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are set to values starting from `small_element` and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent index. The corresponding elements in `cliquess` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are all set to `clique`. The variable `i` will be equal to `mid - 1` after the loop finishes, and both `left` and `right` will retain their original values.

In more detail:
- `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` will contain the sequence of integers starting from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`.
- `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` will all be set to `clique`.
- The loop variable `i` will be `mid - 1` after the loop completes.
- The variables `left`, `right`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` will retain their initial or updated values from before the loop started, but no further changes will occur within the loop itself.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(not_mid):
    arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
    cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `not_mid - 1`; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `clique`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `big_element - i`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `not_mid`; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `clique`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `big_element - i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `not_mid`; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `clique`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `big_element - i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
