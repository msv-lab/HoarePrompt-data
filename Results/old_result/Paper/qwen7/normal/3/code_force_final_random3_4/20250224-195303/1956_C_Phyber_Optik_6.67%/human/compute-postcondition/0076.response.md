Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `r` is the largest integer such that `r * n < n * (n + 1) / 2`.
   - `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, otherwise it is the sum of `i * n` for those iterations.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(sum, n + r)
   ```

3. **Determine `r`**:
   - `r` is the largest integer such that `r * n < n * (n + 1) / 2`.
   - This means `r = floor((n + 1) / 2) - 1`.

4. **Determine `sum`**:
   - We need to check if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
   - Since `i = n`, the condition simplifies to checking if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > n * n`.
   - Simplifying further, we get `(n + 1) // 2 > n`, which is false because `(n + 1) // 2` is always less than or equal to `n` for any positive integer `n`.
   - Therefore, `sum` will be the sum of `i * n` for those iterations, which is just `i * n` since there are no iterations where the condition is true.
   - So, `sum = n * n`.

5. **Final Values**:
   - `sum = n * n`
   - `r = floor((n + 1) / 2) - 1`
   - `n + r = n + floor((n + 1) / 2) - 1`

6. **Output**:
   - The code will print `sum` and `n + r`.
   - `sum` is `n * n`.
   - `n + r` is `n + floor((n + 1) / 2) - 1`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **n * n, n + floor((n + 1) / 2) - 1**
