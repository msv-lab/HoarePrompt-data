Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and for each test case, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with a length between 1 and 10^6. The sum of the lengths of all strings `s` does not exceed 10^6. The function returns a result based on the processing of each test case.**
