Based on the initial state provided:

- `mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`.
- `i` is equal to `n-1`.
- `maxi` is `n-2`.
- `res` is the new input string from the user, and currently, its value is '<'.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `maxi` is `n-2`.
- `i` is `n-1`.

So, the print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `maxi` and `i`, which are `n-2` and `n-1` respectively.

Output: **'? n-2 n-2 n-1 n-1'**
