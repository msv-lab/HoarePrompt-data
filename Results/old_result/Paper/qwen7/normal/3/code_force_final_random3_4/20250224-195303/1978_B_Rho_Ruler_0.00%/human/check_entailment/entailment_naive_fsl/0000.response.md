Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize Bob's profit. Specifically, the binary search approach used in the `func_1` function is not appropriate for this problem. The goal is to find the optimal value of \( k \) that maximizes the profit, but the current implementation does not explore all possible values of \( k \) and instead uses a binary search which may not find the optimal solution.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: \( n = 4 \), \( a = 4 \), \( b = 5 \)
- Expected output: 17 (as explained in the example)

However, the program outputs a different result because it does not correctly evaluate all possible values of \( k \). For instance, the binary search might prematurely terminate without checking all possible values of \( k \).

A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of \( k \) from 0 to \( n \) and calculating the profit for each \( k \) to find the maximum profit. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(n + 1):
            profit = k * b + (n - k) * a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This version iterates over all possible values of \( k \) and calculates the profit for each, ensuring that the maximum profit is found.
