Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + (data[idx - data[idx]])`, `n` is `int(data[idx])`, `a` is a list of integers created by mapping `int` over the slice of `data` from `idx` to `idx + n`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a)`, `t` is `t - 1 and must be greater than 1**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `n` to be the integer value of `data[idx]`. All other variables remain in their previous states. The value of `idx` is updated according to its previous definition, and `a` and `results` are left as they were, with `results` having an additional element due to the return value of `func_1(n, a)`.
