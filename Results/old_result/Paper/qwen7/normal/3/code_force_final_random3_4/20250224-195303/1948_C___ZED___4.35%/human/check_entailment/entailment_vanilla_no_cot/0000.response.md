Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Handling of Test Cases**: The solution does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It processes only one test case per call to `func()`. To handle multiple test cases, you need to loop over the number of test cases (`t`) as specified in the problem statement.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The logic for determining if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` is flawed. Specifically:
   - The condition `if b[-2] != '>'` is too restrictive and does not account for all possible scenarios.
   - The logic for checking if the robot can move from the first row to the second row and then to the last column is overly complex and incorrect.

3. **Incorrect Looping Logic**: The loops for checking the path are not correctly implemented. The conditions for determining if the robot can move to the last column are not properly evaluated.

### Corrected Solution:
Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Check if the last column can be reached from the second row
        if b[-1] != '>':
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if the robot can move from the first row to the second row
        can_move_down = True
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == '<' and b[i] == '<':
                can_move_down = False
                break
        
        if can_move_down:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Call the function with the input
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Loop Over Test Cases**: The outer loop iterates over the number of test cases.
2. **Check Last Column**: The condition `if b[-1] != '>'` checks if the last column can be reached directly from the second row.
3. **Check Path from First to Second Row**: The inner loop checks if the robot can move from the first row to the second row. If both the current cell in the first row and the corresponding cell in the second row have arrows pointing left, the robot cannot move down.
4. **Output Result**: Based on the above checks, the appropriate output is printed.

This solution correctly handles the problem as described and ensures the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)` if possible.
