Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ppp` is explicitly given as 23.
   - `l` and `r` are integers obtained from input, but their specific values are not provided.
   - `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted into `arr` to maintain it sorted. Since `arr` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `eli` without knowing `arr` and `l`.
   - `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned values from `arr[min(eli, LA)]` or `arr[max(eli, LA)]` depending on the condition `s > l`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s - 1, s)
   ```

Given the initial state, we know:
- `s` is derived from `arr[min(eli, LA)]` or `arr[max(eli, LA)]` based on the condition `s > l`.

Since `s` is derived from the array `arr` and the condition `s > l`, we need to consider the possible values of `s`. However, without the exact values of `l` and `arr`, we cannot determine the exact value of `s`. But we can still describe the output format.

The output will be two values separated by a space, where the first value is `s - 1` and the second value is `s`.

Output: **s - 1, s**
