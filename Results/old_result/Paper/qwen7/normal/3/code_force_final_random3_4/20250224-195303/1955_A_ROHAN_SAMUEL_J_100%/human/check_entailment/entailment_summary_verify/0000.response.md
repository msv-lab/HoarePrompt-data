### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- The goal is to minimize the cost of buying \( n \) yogurts where the cost per yogurt is \( a \) and the promotional cost for two yogurts is \( b \).
- If \( n \) is odd, we need to buy one yogurt at the regular price \( a \) and the rest in pairs at the promotional price \( b \).
- If \( n \) is even, we can either buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price \( b \) or buy some at the regular price \( a \) and some at the promotional price \( b \).

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function processes multiple test cases, each with three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
- It calculates and prints the minimum cost for each test case.
- The function does not modify the input values across different test cases.

#### Program Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
```

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Odd Number of Yogurts (\( n \% 2 == 1 \))**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( n \) is odd by buying one yogurt at the regular price \( a \) and the rest in pairs at the promotional price \( b \).
   - This part of the logic is correct.

2. **Even Number of Yogurts (\( n \% 2 == 0 \))**:
   - The program has two conditions:
     - If \( 2 * a < b \), it prints \( a * n \), which means it buys all yogurts at the regular price.
     - Otherwise, it prints \( n // 2 * b \), which means it buys all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price.

   - The issue lies in the second condition. The program does not consider the scenario where buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price might still be cheaper than buying some at the regular price and some at the promotional price.

   - To illustrate, consider the example provided in the original assessment:
     - Input: `2 5 8`
     - Here, \( n = 2 \), \( a = 5 \), and \( b = 8 \).
     - The optimal way is to buy both yogurts at the promotional price, so the cost should be \( 2 * 5 / 2 * 8 = 20 \) burles.
     - However, the program prints \( 5 * 2 = 10 \) burles because it incorrectly assumes that buying all at the regular price is cheaper when \( 2 * a < b \).

   - Another example:
     - Input: `2 5 10`
     - Here, \( n = 2 \), \( a = 5 \), and \( b = 10 \).
     - The optimal way is to buy both yogurts at the promotional price, so the cost should be \( 2 * 5 / 2 * 10 = 20 \) burles.
     - The program correctly prints \( 10 \) burles.

   - The program fails to handle the general case where the promotional price is less than twice the regular price and the number of yogurts is even.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the case where the promotional price is less than twice the regular price and the number of yogurts is even. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final:
**False**
