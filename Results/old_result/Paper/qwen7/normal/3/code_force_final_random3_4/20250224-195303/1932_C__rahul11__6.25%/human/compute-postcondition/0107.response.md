Output State: **`c` is 3, `k` is `n` - 2, `ans` is the result of repeatedly dividing `ans` by either `arr[l]` or `arr[r]` based on the characters in `s` up to index `n` - 2, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is the leftmost index that hasn't been divided out yet, and `r` is the rightmost index that hasn't been divided out yet; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split into integers.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the result in the list `arr`. The values of `c`, `k`, `ans`, `res`, `l`, `r`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
