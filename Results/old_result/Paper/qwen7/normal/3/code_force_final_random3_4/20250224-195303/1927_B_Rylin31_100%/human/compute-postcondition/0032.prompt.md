Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `k + 1`, `input_value` must be greater than `k + 1`, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` elements, each initialized to 0, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `ans` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in array:
    ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
    s[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `k + 1`, `input_value` must be greater than `k + 1`, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` elements, each initialized to 0, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `ans` is a string with the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97` appended to it, `j` is the first element of the `array`, `s[j]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `k + 1`, `input_value` must be greater than `k + 1`, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` elements, each initialized to 0, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `ans` is a string with the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97` appended to it twice, `j` is the second element of the `array`, `s[j]` is incremented by 1, `s[j]` is now one more than its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `k + 1`, `input_value` must be greater than `k + 1`, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` elements, each initialized to 0, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())` but now the first element is removed (the previous `j`), the next element becomes the new `j`, `ans` is a string with the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97` appended to it once, `j` is the next element in the `array` (the element after the previous `j`), `s[j]` is incremented by 1, and `s[j]` is now one more than its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
