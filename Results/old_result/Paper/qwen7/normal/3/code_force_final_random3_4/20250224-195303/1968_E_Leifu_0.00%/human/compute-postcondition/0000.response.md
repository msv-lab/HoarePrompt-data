Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive; `n` is not defined yet.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input is an integer within the range 1 to 50, the value of `t` is updated accordingly. However, the variable `n` is not defined or assigned any value in this snippet, so it remains undefined.
