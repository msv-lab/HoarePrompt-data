Output State: `mid` and `h` will be such that `l` is no longer less than `h`. This means the loop has terminated, and `mid` will be the last midpoint calculated where the condition `l < h` was still true. `l` will be equal to or greater than `h`, indicating the search range has been exhausted. The values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` will be the sums of `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` respectively, based on the last calculation within the loop. The variables `total` and `students` remain undefined as they were not involved in the loop's logic.

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the loop has found the best possible midpoint (`mid`) where the condition `l < h` no longer holds, and the variables `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` hold the relevant sum values from the last iteration. The loop termination ensures that further calculations are not performed.
