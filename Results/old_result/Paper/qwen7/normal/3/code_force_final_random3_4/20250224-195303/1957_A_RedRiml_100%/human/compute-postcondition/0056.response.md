Output State: **`shapes` is increased by the total count of each element in `palka` divided by 3, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they appeared, and the count of each element in `d` is greater than or equal to 3 after all iterations, `w` is decreased by 1, `ln` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `ln = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `ln`. The other variables (`shapes`, `pl`, `d`, and `w`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
