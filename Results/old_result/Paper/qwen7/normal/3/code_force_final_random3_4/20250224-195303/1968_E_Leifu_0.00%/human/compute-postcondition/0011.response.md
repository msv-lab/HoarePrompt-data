Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `j` as the variable iterating over the range `4` to `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be at least 4.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `j` starting from 4 up to `n + 1`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 4 and increments by 1 each time, the loop will continue until `j` reaches `n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have been `n`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` remains unchanged at 0.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `n` must still be at least 4, but since the loop will continue, `n` must now be at least 5 (because `j` was `n` in the previous iteration and will increment to `n + 1`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` must be at least 5**
