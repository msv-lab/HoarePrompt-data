Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers t, a, and m for each test case, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a, b, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}. It returns the result based on the value of t, processing a, b, and m accordingly for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving three integers (a, b, and m), and the number of test cases is specified by the integer t. The function processes these integers according to the given constraints and returns a result based on the value of t and the values of a, b, and m for each test case.
