Output State: **`test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces. Clues[3] is less than clues[5], and the absolute difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is greater than 1. Clues[2] is greater than clues[4], or clues[2] is odd while clues[4] is even, or clues[2] is even while clues[4] is odd. Additionally, the difference between clues[1] and clues[5] is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between clues[2] and clues[4], or the difference between clues[5] and clues[3] is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between clues[2] and clues[4].**

Explanation: The code appends the string 'Draw' to the list `answers`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions involving the list `clues` remain valid as no changes were made to its elements.
