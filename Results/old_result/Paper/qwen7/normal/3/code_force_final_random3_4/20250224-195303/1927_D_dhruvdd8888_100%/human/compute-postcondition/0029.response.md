Output State: `i` is equal to `N`, `N` is a valid positive integer, `num` is equal to `nums[N]`, `s` is `N`, and `arr` contains tuples starting from `(1 + s, 0, num)` up to `(N + s, N, nums[N])`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be equal to `N`, indicating that the loop has completed its execution. The variable `num` will hold the value of `nums[N]` since it gets updated to `nums[i]` on each iteration. The variable `s` will also be equal to `N`, as it gets updated to `i` whenever `nums[i]` is different from `num`. The list `arr` will contain all the necessary segments defined by the conditions inside the loop, starting from the initial segment `(1 + s, 0, num)` up to the final segment `(N + s, N, nums[N])`.
