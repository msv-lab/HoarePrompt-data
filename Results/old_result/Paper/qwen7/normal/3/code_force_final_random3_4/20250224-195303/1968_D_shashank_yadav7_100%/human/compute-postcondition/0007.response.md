Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n`, `k`, `b` are integers inputted from the user, `s` is `s - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `sp` is the element at index `s` in list `a`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the element at index `s` in the list `a` to the variable `sp`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `s` is updated to `s - 1` from the initial state.
