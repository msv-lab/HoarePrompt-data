Output State: The final value of `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between every consecutive pair of elements in `new_arr`.

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `max_beauty` will hold the total sum of the absolute differences between each pair of adjacent elements in the `new_arr` list. This means `max_beauty` will be incremented in each iteration by the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i-1]` for every `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
