Postcondition: `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y), `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` contains at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary, `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `rx` is (-`a` % `x` + `x`) % `x`, `ry` is `a` % `y`. If `current_pair` is already in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `freq` is updated to include the key `current_pair` with value 1.
