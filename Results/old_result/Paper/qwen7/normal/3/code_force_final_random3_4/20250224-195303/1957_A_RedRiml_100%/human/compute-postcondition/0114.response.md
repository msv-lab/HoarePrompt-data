Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in palka:`. The only object involved here is `i` and `palka`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `palka` is a list of integers obtained from input.
   - `i` will take each value from `palka` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `palka`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if `palka` is not an empty list.

4. **Consider the other given states**:
   - `ln` is an input integer (not relevant to the loop execution).
   - `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3 (not relevant to the loop execution).
   - `d` is an empty dictionary (not relevant to the loop execution).
   - `pl` is an empty list (not relevant to the loop execution).
   - `_` is incremented by 1 (not relevant to the loop execution).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop depends on `palka` having at least one element, we need to ensure `palka` is not empty.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `palka` should not be an empty list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`palka` is a non-empty list of integers**
