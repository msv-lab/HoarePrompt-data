### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1()` is called for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, the string `s` is converted into a list of characters.
   - The length of the string `n` is determined.

3. **Finding Tandem Repeats:**
   - The program iterates over possible lengths of tandem repeats from the largest possible (half the length of the string) down to 1.
   - For each possible length `j`, it checks substrings of length `2*j`.
   - It uses a counter `count` to check if the characters at positions `k` and `k+j` match or are question marks.
   - If a match is found, `count` is incremented; otherwise, `count` is reset to 0.
   - If `count` equals `j`, it means a valid tandem repeat of length `2*j` has been found, and the program prints `2*j` and returns.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If no valid tandem repeat is found after checking all possible lengths, the program prints `0`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Handling Question Marks:**
   - The program correctly handles question marks by allowing them to match any lowercase Latin letter.
   - This ensures that the maximum possible tandem repeat length is considered.

2. **Iterating Over Possible Lengths:**
   - The program iterates over possible lengths of tandem repeats from the largest to the smallest, ensuring that the first valid tandem repeat found is the longest one possible.

3. **Checking Substrings:**
   - The program correctly checks each substring of length `2*j` to see if it forms a tandem repeat.
   - It uses a counter to keep track of matching characters, which is essential for determining valid tandem repeats.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles strings where no tandem repeat is possible by printing `0`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function `func_1()`**:
  - The function correctly processes the string `s` and checks for tandem repeats.
  - It iterates over possible lengths of tandem repeats from the largest to the smallest.
  - It uses a counter `count` to ensure that the characters at positions `k` and `k+j` match or are question marks.
  - If a valid tandem repeat is found, it prints the length and returns.
  - If no valid tandem repeat is found, it prints `0`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles edge cases correctly, such as strings without any tandem repeats.

- **Overall Logic**:
  - The logic implemented in the function is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to find the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat after replacing each question mark with a lowercase Latin letter.

### Final Answer:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
