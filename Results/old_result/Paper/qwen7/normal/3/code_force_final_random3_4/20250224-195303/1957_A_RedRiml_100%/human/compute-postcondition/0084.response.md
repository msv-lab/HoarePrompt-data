Output State: **`d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key whose value is incremented by 1, `pl` contains the next element of `i`, and `i` is the next element in `palka`.**

This means that the dictionary `d` has the key `i` with its value incremented by 1. The list `pl` still contains the next element of `i`, and `i` is updated to the next element in the list `palka`.
