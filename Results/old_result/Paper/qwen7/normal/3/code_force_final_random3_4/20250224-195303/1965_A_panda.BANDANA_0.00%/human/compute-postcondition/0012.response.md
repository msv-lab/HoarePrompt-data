Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. `e` is a set containing unique elements from the list `l`; `m` is the length of the list `l`. If the list `l` contains the integer 1, then 1 is included in the set `e`. Otherwise, the list `l` does not contain the integer 1.
