Output State: **`nx` is the string 'xx[i][j - 1]', `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The string `nx` is concatenated with the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. Since `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` now includes this value. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, while `n` remains greater than or equal to 1 and `j` stays as 1.
