Output State: **`n` is the final number of iterations, `j` is `n + 1`, `eta` is a list containing the value `n + 1`.**

The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` (which is `n + 1`) to the list `eta`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `eta` now contains the value `n + 1` in addition to any other values it may have had before.
