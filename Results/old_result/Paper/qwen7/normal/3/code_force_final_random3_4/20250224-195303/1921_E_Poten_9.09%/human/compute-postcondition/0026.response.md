Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Bob', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces. Clues[2] is less than or equal to clues[4], clues[0] is not equal to 1, and either both clues[2] and clues[4] are even or both are odd. Additionally, clues[3] is not equal to clues[5], and the current value of `clues[3]` is less than the current value of `clues[5]`. The absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1. If the condition `(clues[3] - 1 >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[5] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))` is true, `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'.**
