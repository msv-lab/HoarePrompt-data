The function calls another function `func_2()` with specified parameters including an integer `t`, an integer `n`, an integer `m`, an integer `k`, a sorted list `a` of integers, and two other lists `d` and `f`. It then returns the result of this call. The parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are bounded within certain ranges, and the lists `a`, `d`, and `f` have specific constraints on their contents and lengths.
