Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for j in range(adv):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `adv`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**:
   - `cur` is decreased by `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`.
   - `adv` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is within the range `[1, len(a) - 1]`.
   - `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order.
   - `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the new list `a`.
   - `cnt` is `n - len(a)`.
   - `ans` is a list containing `a[i - 1] - 1`.
   - `j` is 1.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `adv` must be greater than 0.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and the loop runs for `adv` iterations, if `adv` is greater than 1, `j` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, if the loop is to execute again, `j` will be 2.
   - `adv` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `adv`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cur` is decreased by `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `adv` must be greater than 0, `i` is within the range `[1, len(a) - 1]`, `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the new list `a`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list containing `a[i - 1] - 1`, `j` is 2**
