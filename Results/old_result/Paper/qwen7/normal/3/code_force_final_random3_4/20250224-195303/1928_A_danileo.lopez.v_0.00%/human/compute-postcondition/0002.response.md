Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the underscore variable `_` is still 0.
