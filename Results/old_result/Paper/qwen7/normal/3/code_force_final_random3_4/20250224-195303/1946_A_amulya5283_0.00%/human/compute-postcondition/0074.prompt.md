You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer n (the length of the array a) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (each a_i is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive). The length of each array a is between 1 and 10^5, and the sum of all lengths n across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n, arr = test_cases[i]
        
        arr.sort()
        
        median_index = n // 2
        
        current_median = arr[median_index]
        
        heap = arr[median_index:]
        
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        
        operations = 0
        
        while heap[0] <= current_median:
            smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
            heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
            operations += 1
        
        results.append(operations)
        
    #State: `results` is a list containing the total number of operations performed for all test cases, `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `i` is equal to `t-1`, `n` is the last element's first value from `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the last tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index] - 3 * t`, `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[median_index + 3 * t]` to the end of `arr` with each element incremented by 6 * t, `operations` is the total number of operations performed across all test cases, and `smallest` is the smallest element popped from `heap`, with `smallest + 1` being pushed onto `heap`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list named 'results' which contains the total number of operations performed for all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (the length of the array `a`) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (each `a_i` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive). For each test case, it returns the total number of operations performed, and finally, it returns a list named 'results' containing the total number of operations for all test cases.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list named 'results' which contains the total number of operations performed for all test cases.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
