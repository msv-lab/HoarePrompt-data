Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, and the elements at index `i` of arrays `a` and `b` are not equal. If `c[0]` is either equal to `a[0]` or `b[0]`, then the function does nothing further. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True, and the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
