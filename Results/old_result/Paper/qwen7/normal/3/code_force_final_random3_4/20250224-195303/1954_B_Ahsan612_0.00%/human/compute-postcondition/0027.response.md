Output State: **`same` is either 2 or 3, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list `ar`, `i` is incremented by 1 and `i + 1` must be less than `len(ar)`, `same` remains unchanged if `ar[i]` equals `num`, otherwise `same` becomes 1, `minn` is updated to be the minimum of `minn` and `same`, and `num` is set to `ar[i]`**.

In natural language: The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The condition that `i + 1` must be less than `len(ar)` is still valid. If `ar[i]` equals `num`, `same` remains unchanged (either 2 or 3). Otherwise, `same` becomes 1, `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and 1, and `num` is set to `ar[i]`. All other variables retain their original conditions and values.
