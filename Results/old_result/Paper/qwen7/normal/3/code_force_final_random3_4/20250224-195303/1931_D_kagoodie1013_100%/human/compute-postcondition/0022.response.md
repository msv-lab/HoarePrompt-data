Output State: `count` is the sum of all values obtained from `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each `num` in `arr`; `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key `(-num % x, num % y)` is mapped to its frequency (i.e., how many times it appears as a result of the operations within the loop for different `num` values in `arr`); `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`, and `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `count` will be the total number of occurrences of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` derived from the elements of `arr`. The `residue_map` dictionary will contain every unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair found during the loop's execution, with the value being the count of how many times that specific pair was encountered.
