You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #- `curr` will hold the value of `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - len(paths) + 1)`, which represents the final calculation of `curr` when `k` equals the length of `paths`.
    #- `pres` will be the sum of all elements in the `paths` list.
    #- `ress` will contain the maximum value between its initial value and all the calculated `curr` values during the loop iterations. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, `ress` will be updated to the maximum value between `ress` and `resb`.

    #In summary, after all iterations, the decision ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') will be based on the comparison between `resb` and `ress`, with `resb` and `ress` being updated according to the calculations performed within the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game." Specifically, the program does not account for the possibility of a player moving back and forth between positions, which could potentially maximize their score. Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

- **Testcase Input:**
  - `n = 4`, `k = 2`, `P_B = 3`, `P_S = 2`
  - Permutation: `[4, 1, 2, 3]`
  - Array `a`: `[7, 2, 5, 6]`

- **Expected Outcome:**
  - Bodya starts at position 3 (value 3). His possible moves are:
    - Stay at 3: Score = 5 (since `a[3-1] = 5`).
    - Move to position 2 (value 1): Score = 5 (since `a[3-1] = 5`).
  - Sasha starts at position 2 (value 1). His possible moves are:
    - Stay at 2: Score = 2 (since `a[2-1] = 2`).
    - Move to position 4 (value 3): Score = 2 (since `a[2-1] = 2`).

- **Actual Output:**
  - The program calculates the scores as follows:
    - Bodya's score: `5 + 5 = 10` (staying at 3 for both turns).
    - Sasha's score: `2 + 2 = 4` (staying at 2 for both turns).

- **Issue:**
  - The program does not consider the optimal strategy for Sasha. Sasha can move from position 2 to position 4, and then back to position 2, achieving a higher score of `2 + 3 + 2 = 7`.

Therefore, the program does not handle all possible optimal strategies for the players, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
