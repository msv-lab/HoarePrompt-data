### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously in the sky.
- Each installation launches fireworks at regular intervals \(a\) and \(b\) respectively.
- Each firework is visible for \(m + 1\) minutes after launch.
- The key point is to account for the overlapping visibility periods of fireworks launched at different intervals.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes up to 10,000 test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates and prints the value of \(m // a + m // b + 2\).
- This formula is incorrect because it does not account for the overlapping visibility periods of fireworks launched at different intervals.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\).
2. Determine how many fireworks are launched within the visibility period \(m\).
3. Account for the overlapping intervals.

Let's manually verify the correct solution for the case `7 8 56`:

- Fireworks from the first installation: `[56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112]`
- Fireworks from the second installation: `[56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112]`

The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is indeed 17, but the program's logic does not correctly handle the overlapping intervals. 

The provided program uses the formula \(m // a + m // b + 2\), which is incorrect because it does not account for the overlapping intervals. The correct approach involves using the LCM of \(a\) and \(b\) to determine the number of overlapping intervals.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not account for the overlapping intervals of fireworks launched at different intervals.
