Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `operational_list`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `operational_list`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string.
   - `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the string `x`.
   - `rev_res` is incremented by `x` if the length of `x` is equal to the length of the string representation of `x_rev`.
   - Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `operational_list`, the next `x` will be the next string in the list.
   - Therefore, `operational_list` will lose its first element (the current `x`).

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `operational_list` must now be a list of strings that has at least one less string than before.
   - `x_rev` will be the integer value of the reverse of the new `x` (which is the next string in the list).
   - `rev_res` and `rev_val` remain unchanged for the purpose of determining the next state.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the next string in the list.**
