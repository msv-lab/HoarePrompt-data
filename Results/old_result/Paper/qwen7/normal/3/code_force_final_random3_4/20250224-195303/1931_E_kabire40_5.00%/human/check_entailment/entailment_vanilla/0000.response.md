Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the rules and logic of the game described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `y`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the list `list_len` and the parameter `max_power`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `operational_list`.

2. **Reversing Elements:**
   - The program iterates through each element in `operational_list`.
   - For each element, it reverses the digits and checks if the length of the reversed number is the same as the original number.
     - If the lengths are the same, it appends the original number to `rev_res`.
     - If the lengths differ, it appends the reversed number to `rev_val`.

3. **Sorting Reversed Values:**
   - The reversed values in `rev_val` are sorted.

4. **Constructing the Result String:**
   - The program constructs a new string `rev_res` by alternating between elements from `rev_val` and their reversed forms.
   - This alternation ensures that Sasha and Anna's moves are simulated in a way that maintains the game's turn-based nature.

5. **Checking Winning Condition:**
   - Finally, the program checks if the constructed string `rev_res` is greater than or equal to \(10^{max_power}\).
     - If true, Sasha wins.
     - If false, Anna wins.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Reversed Lengths:**
   - The program incorrectly handles the condition where the reversed number has the same length as the original number. Instead of appending the original number to `rev_res`, it should append the reversed number to `rev_val`.

2. **Incorrect Alternation Logic:**
   - The alternation logic is flawed. The program should alternate between elements from `rev_val` and their reversed forms, but the current implementation does not correctly simulate the game's alternating turns.

3. **No Consideration for Game Rules:**
   - The program does not implement the game rules correctly. Specifically, it does not simulate Sasha and Anna taking turns and removing elements as per the rules.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that properly simulates the game:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (list_len, max_power) = map(int, input().split())
        operational_list = list(map(int, input().split()))

        # Reverse each number and store in a list
        reversed_list = [str(num)[::-1] for num in operational_list]

        # Sort the reversed numbers
        reversed_list.sort()

        # Simulate the game
        while len(reversed_list) > 1:
            # Anna's move: reverse one number
            reversed_list[0] = reversed_list[0][::-1]
            # Sasha's move: concatenate two numbers
            first = reversed_list.pop(0)
            second = reversed_list.pop(0)
            combined = int(first + str(second))
            reversed_list.append(str(combined))

        # Check the final number
        final_number = int(reversed_list[0])
        if final_number >= 10 ** max_power:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Anna')

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not properly simulate the game rules. The corrected program above should accurately determine the winner based on the optimal play of both players.

**Correctness: False**
