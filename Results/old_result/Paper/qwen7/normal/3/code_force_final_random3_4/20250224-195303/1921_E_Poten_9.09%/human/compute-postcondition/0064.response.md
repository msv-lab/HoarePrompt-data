Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob' or 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces. Clues[2] is less than or equal to clues[4], clues[0] is not equal to 1, and either both clues[2] and clues[4] are even or both are odd. If clues[3] equals clues[5], `answers` is ['Bob']. Otherwise, based on the absolute difference between clues[3] and clues[5] and certain conditions involving clues[1], clues[2], clues[3], clues[4], and clues[5], `answers` will contain either 'Draw' or 'Bob'.**
