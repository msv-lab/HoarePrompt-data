Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least three elements, `rev_val` is a sorted list of the reversed integers of the reversed strings in `operational_list` whose reverse does not have the same length as the original string, `rev_res` is the sum of all integers in `rev_val` plus the integer value of the last element of `operational_list` if its reverse has the same length as the original string, otherwise it includes the reversed integer of the last element, `y` remains 1, `x` is `x + 1`, and `val_in` is the value of `rev_val[x]`, `rev_res` is updated by adding the reverse of `val_in`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res += val_in[::-1]` updates `rev_res` by adding the reverse of `val_in` to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
