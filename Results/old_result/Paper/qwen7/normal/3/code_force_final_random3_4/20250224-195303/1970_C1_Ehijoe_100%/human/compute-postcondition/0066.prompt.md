Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ends` is a list of all keys from the dictionary `nodes` whose corresponding value lists have a length of exactly one; `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the list `ends`, respectively; `tree` is a list containing the element `s`; `prev` is equal to `s`; `curr` is the first element of `nodes[s]`.
Code of the loop:
while curr != e:
    tree.append(curr)
    if nodes[curr][0] == prev:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][1]
    else:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `prev` is equal to `curr`, `tree` contains the elements `s` and `curr`, and `curr` is the first element of `nodes[prev]` that is not equal to `e`. If `nodes[curr][0]` is equal to `prev`, then `curr` is the second element of `nodes[s]`. Otherwise, `curr` is the first element of `nodes[old curr]` that is not equal to `e`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `prev` is equal to `curr`, `tree` contains the elements `s`, `curr`, and `curr` is either the first or the second element of `nodes[curr]` that is not equal to `e`. If `nodes[curr][0]` is equal to `prev`, then `curr` is the second such element; otherwise, `curr` is the first such element.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `prev` is equal to `curr`, `curr` is either equal to the second element in `nodes[curr]` that is not equal to `e` and different from `prev`, or it is equal to the first node connected to `curr` in the `nodes` list, and `tree` now contains the elements `s`, `curr`, and `e` is different from `curr`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
