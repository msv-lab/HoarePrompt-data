Output State: **`cases` is 3, `arr` is [26], `j` must be between 0 and 1 inclusive, `lex` is an input integer greater than or equal to 26**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Since `lex` was initially an input integer greater than or equal to 52, after subtracting 26, `lex` becomes an input integer greater than or equal to 26. The other variables (`cases`, `arr`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
