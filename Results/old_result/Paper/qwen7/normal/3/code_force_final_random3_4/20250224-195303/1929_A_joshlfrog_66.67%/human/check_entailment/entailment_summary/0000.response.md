Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding the maximum possible beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

The provided program only calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. This approach does not account for the arrangement of elements to maximize the beauty of the array. To achieve the maximum beauty, we should sort the array in either non-decreasing or non-increasing order and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Here's the correct approach:
1. Sort the array.
2. Calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Let's evaluate the given program with this understanding:

1. It reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
2. For each test case, it finds the maximum and minimum values in the array.
3. It calculates the difference between these two values and prints it.

This method does not guarantee the maximum beauty because it does not consider the optimal arrangement of elements to maximize the sum of differences.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
