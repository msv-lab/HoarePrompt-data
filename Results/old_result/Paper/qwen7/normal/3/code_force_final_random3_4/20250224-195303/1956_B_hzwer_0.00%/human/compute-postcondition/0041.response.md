Output State: **`j` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `dp[i][j]` is calculated as the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. The count of `j + 1` in `cards` is 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the maximum of two expressions. The variables `j` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The count of `j + 1` in `cards` remains 1 as no operation affects it.
