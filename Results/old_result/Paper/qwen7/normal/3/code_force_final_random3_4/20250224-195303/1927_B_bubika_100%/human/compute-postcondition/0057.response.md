Output State: **`r` is now `2 * a[x]`, `s` must contain at least one element, `b[x]` is increased by 2, `x` is the index of `i` in list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `b[x] += 1` increases the value of `b[x]` by 1. Since `b[x]` was previously increased by 1 (as per the initial state), it is now increased by 2 in total. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
