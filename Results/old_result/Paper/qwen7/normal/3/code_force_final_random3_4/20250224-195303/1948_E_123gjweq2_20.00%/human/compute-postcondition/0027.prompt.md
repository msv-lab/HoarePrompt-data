You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are integers such that left < right, and clique is an integer representing the clique identifier.
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + i] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: All elements in `arr` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are set to values starting from `small_element` and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent index. The corresponding elements in `cliquess` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are all set to `clique`. The variable `i` will be equal to `mid - 1` after the loop finishes, and both `left` and `right` will retain their original values.
    #
    #In more detail:
    #- `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` will contain the sequence of integers starting from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`.
    #- `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` will all be set to `clique`.
    #- The loop variable `i` will be `mid - 1` after the loop completes.
    #- The variables `left`, `right`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` will retain their initial or updated values from before the loop started, but no further changes will occur within the loop itself.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: The array `arr` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` will contain the sequence of integers starting from `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` to `big_element - 1`. The corresponding elements in `cliquess` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` will all be set to `clique`. The variable `i` will be equal to `not_mid` after the loop finishes, and both `left`, `right`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` will retain their original values from before the loop started.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the elements in `arr` from `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` will be filled with decreasing values starting from `big_element - 1` down to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`, while the corresponding elements in `cliquess` will all be set to `clique`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two integers `left` and `right` (with `left` less than `right`) and an integer `clique` representing a clique identifier, without specifying any explicit return value.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
