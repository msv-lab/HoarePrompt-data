Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x // 2`**.

Explanation: The code `x = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input (converted to an integer) to the variable `x`. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged, and `y` is recalculated as `x // 2` based on the new value of `x`.
