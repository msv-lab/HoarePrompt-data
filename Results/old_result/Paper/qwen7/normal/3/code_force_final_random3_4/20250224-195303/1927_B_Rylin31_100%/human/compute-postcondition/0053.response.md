Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter t, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it accepts two parameters: n, a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a, a list of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The function returns a value based on the input parameters.**

This means the function `func` takes three inputs: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10,000. `n` is also a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, and `a` is a list containing `n` non-negative integers, each of which is less than `n`. The function processes these inputs and returns a specific value based on the given conditions.
