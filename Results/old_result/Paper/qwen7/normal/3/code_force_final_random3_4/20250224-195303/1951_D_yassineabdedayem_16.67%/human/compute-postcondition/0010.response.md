Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` must be non-zero, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` is 0, `number` is `Min`, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `k`**.

Explanation: The variable `number` is assigned the value of `Min`, which is defined as `min(n // k, k)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
