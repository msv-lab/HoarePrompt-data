Output State: **Postcondition: `j` is `n-1`, `done` is `True`, `count` is `n-1`, `count2` is `0`, and `i` is `-1`.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `j` will be equal to `n-1` because the loop decrements `j` from `n-1` to `0`. Since the loop exits when `done` is set to `True`, `done` will be `True` by the end. `count` will be `n-1` because it is incremented each time `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1 (which happens until `j` reaches `n-1`). `count2` remains `0` because it is only incremented when `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`, but since `count` is always incremented before `count2` can be incremented in the loop, `count2` never gets a chance to increment. Finally, `i` is set to `-1` outside the loop, so it remains `-1`.
