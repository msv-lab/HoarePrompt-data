### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally.
   - Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (the number of cards you have) and `a` (a list of integers representing the numbers on your cards).
   - It uses `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each number in `a`.
   - It calculates the number of pairs of cards (`pairs`) that have exactly 2 occurrences.
   - It returns the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and the list of integers `a`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Since Nene always plays optimally, she will try to maximize her score and minimize yours.
   - If you have a card that Nene also has, she will play that card to score a point.
   - To maximize your score, you should avoid giving Nene opportunities to score points by playing cards that she also has.

5. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the number of pairs of cards that can be played.
   - However, it does not fully account for the optimal strategy of Nene.
   - Specifically, `func_1` only counts pairs and does not consider the optimal play of Nene.

6. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - The logic in `func_2` is correct for reading and processing the input.
   - It correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.

### Conclusion:

- While `func_2` is correct for reading and processing the input, `func_1` does not fully implement the optimal strategy required to solve the problem.
- Therefore, the overall program is not correct because `func_1` does not correctly simulate the optimal play of Nene.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
