Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `k` is an input integer (not used in the loop condition)
   - `array` is a list containing numbers from 1 to `n`
   - `answer` is a list containing the number 1, and either the element at index -1 of list `a` (which is -2) or the element at index 1 of `array` (which is 2)
   - `a` is a list containing `[2, -1]`

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1 and the loop runs as long as `i < n`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` changes to 2.
   - `n` remains the same (an input integer).

6. **Final State**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is an input integer

Given this reasoning, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer**
