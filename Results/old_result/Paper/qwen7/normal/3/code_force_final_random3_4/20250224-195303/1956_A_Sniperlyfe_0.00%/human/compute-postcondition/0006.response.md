Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

The code initializes an empty list named `res`. The values of `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` remain unchanged from their initial states.
