Reasoning:
1. The provided program reads multiple test cases from standard input and processes each one to find the number of beautiful pairs.
2. The program correctly uses the `sys.stdin.read` method to read all input at once and then splits it into manageable parts.
3. For each test case, the program extracts the necessary parameters and the array.
4. The `func_1` function processes each array to count the number of beautiful pairs using a dictionary (`residue_map`) to keep track of the counts of residues.
5. The logic for determining beautiful pairs is correct:
   - For each element `num` in the array, it calculates `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.
   - It checks if there are any previous elements with the same `(r_x, r_y)` pair and adds their count to the current count.
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the current `(r_x, r_y)` pair.
6. The final result for each test case is appended to the `results` list, which is returned at the end.

Given the execution summary and the provided reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
