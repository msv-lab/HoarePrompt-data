### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided code, particularly in the functions `func_2` and `make_stairs`. Let's break down the issues and re-evaluate the code based on the annotated version.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function does not correctly handle the reconstruction of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
   - It attempts to reconstruct operations but does not ensure that the operations are applied in a way that maximizes the sum.
   - The function does not properly account for the MEX value being applied to the entire subarray.

2. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - The function is incomplete and does not correctly implement the logic to set the elements to the MEX value.
   - It does not ensure that the elements are set to the correct MEX value for the subarray.

#### Detailed Evaluation Based on Annotated Code:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum sum of subarrays.
   - It recursively splits the subarray and calculates the maximum sum for each split.
   - The base case handles single-element subarrays correctly.
   - The function returns the maximum sum for the given subarray.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function aims to find the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
   - It uses the results from `func_1` to identify the subarrays where the MEX value can be used to maximize the sum.
   - However, the logic is flawed as mentioned in the original assessment. It does not correctly reconstruct the operations.
   - The function does not ensure that the operations are applied in a way that maximizes the sum.

3. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - The function is intended to create a staircase pattern to achieve the maximum sum.
   - However, the function is incomplete and does not correctly implement the logic to set the elements to the MEX value.
   - It does not ensure that the elements are set to the correct MEX value for the subarray.

Given the detailed analysis, the original assessment is accurate in pointing out the flaws in the implementation. The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The functions `func_2` and `make_stairs` do not correctly generate the operations needed to maximize the sum of the array elements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements using the allowed operations.
