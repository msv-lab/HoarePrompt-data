Postcondition: `test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces. Clues[3] is less than or equal to 1 away from clues[5], Clues[2] is greater than clues[4], and clues[2] is not odd while clues[4] is even, and clues[2] is not even while clues[4] is odd.
