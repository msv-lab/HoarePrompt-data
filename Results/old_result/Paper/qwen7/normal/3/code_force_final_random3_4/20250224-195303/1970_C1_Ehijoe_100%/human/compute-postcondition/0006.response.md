Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be at least 2; `u` is an input integer; `v` is an input integer; `nodes[u]` now includes `v`.**

Explanation: The line `nodes[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `nodes[u]`. Since `u` and `v` are both input integers, the list `nodes[u]` will now contain `v`. The other variables (`i`, `n`) remain unchanged.
