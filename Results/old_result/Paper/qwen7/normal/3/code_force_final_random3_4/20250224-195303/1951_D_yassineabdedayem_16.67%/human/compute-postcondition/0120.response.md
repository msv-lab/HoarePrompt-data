Let's break down the conditions in the `while` loop and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time:

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while n != 0 and k > 0 and (rep < 60) and (n >= k):
```

We need to ensure that all parts of this condition are true for the loop to execute at least once.

1. **`n != 0`**: This means `n` must not be zero.
2. **`k > 0`**: This means `k` must be greater than zero.
3. **`rep < 60`**: This means `rep` must be less than 60.
4. **`n >= k`**: This means `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `rep` is 0
- `k` is a non-zero value
- `i` is the last element in the list `tab`
- `n` is an integer read from standard input
- `k` is an integer read from standard input
- `number` is 0
- `tab` is an empty list

We need to focus on adjusting the states of `n`, `rep`, and `k` because they are the only ones that can change based on the loop condition.

1. **`rep < 60`**: Since `rep` is initially 0, it already satisfies this condition.
2. **`n != 0`**: We need to ensure `n` is not zero.
3. **`k > 0`**: We are given that `k` is a non-zero value, so this condition is already satisfied.
4. **`n >= k`**: We need to ensure `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `n` to ensure it is not zero and is greater than or equal to `k`.

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` must be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a non-zero value, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list.**

However, since `k` is already a non-zero value, we can simplify the answer to focus on `n`:

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` must be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list.**
