You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x // 2
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `t - 1`, `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` will be the last input integer from the user, and `y` will be `x // 2`.
    #
    #This means that the loop will run exactly `t` times, incrementing `i` from 0 to `t-1`. The variable `x` will hold the value of the last input integer provided by the user during the final iteration, and `y` will be the result of dividing `x` by 2 using integer division.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers: `t` (number of iterations, 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and `x` (an integer, 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000). For each test case, it reads `t` values of `x`, calculates `x // 2` for the last input value of `x`, and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function ends with `t` remaining unchanged and within the specified range, `x` holding the last input value, and `y` being the result of the last integer division operation.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly find the integer \( y \) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. Instead, it simply sets \( y \) to be half of \( x \), which is not guaranteed to maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

For example, consider the input \( x = 10 \). The program outputs \( y = 5 \), but the correct output should be \( y = 5 \) because \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\). However, for \( x = 12 \), the program would output \( y = 6 \), but the correct output should be \( y = 4 \) because \(\gcd(12, 4) + 4 = 4 + 4 = 8\), which is greater than \(\gcd(12, 6) + 6 = 6 + 6 = 12\).

Thus, the program does not always find the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\), making it incorrect.
