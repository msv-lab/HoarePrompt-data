Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be at least 1, but its exact value is not specified.
- `n` must be greater than 2, but its exact value is not specified.
- `mak` is explicitly given as 2.
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

This will print the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak` and `i`, repeated twice. Specifically, it will print:
- `'?'` (a question mark)
- `mak`, which is 2
- `mak` again, which is 2
- `i`, which is 3
- `i` again, which is 3

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? 2 2 3 3'**
