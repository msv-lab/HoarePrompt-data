Output State: **`mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`, `res` is incremented by 1, and `n` is an integer not equal to 1 with `mdx < n`.**

Explanation: The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. The values of `mdx`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `mdx` is still `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is still `mdx + 2`, `res` is incremented by 1, and `n` is still an integer not equal to 1 with `mdx < n`.
