You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `x` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `y` is the second integer from the input converted to an integer.
    #
    #After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `x - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `x-1`. However, based on the provided information, we only know the state after 3 iterations, so we can only conclude that `i` is 2. The values of `x` and `y` will be the values entered in the last iteration of the loop, as the loop continuously updates these values with the new inputs. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was set initially and is not affected by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes an integer `t` within the range of 1 to 100, and for each test case, it processes two integers `x` and `y` within the range of 0 to 9. The function does not return any specific value but seems to perform some operations based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
