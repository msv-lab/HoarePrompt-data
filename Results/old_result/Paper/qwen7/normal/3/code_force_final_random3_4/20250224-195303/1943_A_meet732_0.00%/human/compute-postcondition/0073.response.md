Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postconditions are:
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `c` is 0
   - The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or an if statement.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n + 1`. Given that `j` is currently 1, the loop will execute again as long as `n` is greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, after the first iteration, `j` will be 2. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to 2. The variable `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise, but since no changes are mentioned, it stays the same. The variable `c` remains 0 as there is no indication that it should change within the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**: Based on the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
   - `j` is 2
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1 (unchanged)
   - `c` is 0 (unchanged)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 0**
