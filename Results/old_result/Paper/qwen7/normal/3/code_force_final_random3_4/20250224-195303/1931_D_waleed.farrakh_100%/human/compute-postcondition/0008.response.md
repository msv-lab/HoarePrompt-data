Output State: **`test_cases` is now a list containing one tuple (n, x, y, arr), `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the list `test_cases`. This means that `test_cases` now contains one additional element, which is the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
