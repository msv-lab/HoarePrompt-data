Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cntl[i]` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - The variable `a` remains unchanged as it is the iterable itself and not being modified within the loop.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` was used to index into `cntl` and was increased by 1, for the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `a`.
   - We need to ensure that `i` is set to the next value in `a`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` will be the next element in `a`.
- `cntl[i]` will be increased by 1 again for the next iteration.

Since we don't know the exact value of `a` or its contents, we can only express the state in terms of the next value of `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cntl[i]` is increased by 1, `i` is the next element in `a`**
