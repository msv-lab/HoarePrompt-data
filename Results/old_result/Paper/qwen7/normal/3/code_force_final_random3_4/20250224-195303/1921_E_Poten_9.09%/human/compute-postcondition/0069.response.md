Output State: **`test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the current value of `clues[3]` is equal to the current value of `clues[5]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` is an empty list. After executing `answers.append('Alice')`, `answers` contains the element `'Alice'`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
