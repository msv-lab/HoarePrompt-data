Postcondition: `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the first string in the list. If the length of `x_rev` as a string is equal to the length of the first string in `operational_list`, `rev_res` is equal to `rev_res` plus `x_rev`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of the first string in `operational_list`.
