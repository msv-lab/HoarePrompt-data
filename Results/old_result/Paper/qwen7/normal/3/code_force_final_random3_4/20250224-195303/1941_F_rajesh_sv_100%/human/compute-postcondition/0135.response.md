Output State: `total` is 0, `mid` is the final midpoint where the loop exits, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` and `h` are equal to each other, representing the final boundaries of the search range. The exact value of `mid` depends on the specific conditions met during the loop iterations, but it will be the last midpoint calculated before the loop exited. The values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` will be determined based on whether the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` was met during the last iteration, affecting how `l` and `h` were updated.

This final state indicates that the loop has completed all its iterations, with `mid` pinpointing the optimal search boundary, and `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` providing the necessary sums for further calculations or decisions based on the loop's purpose.
