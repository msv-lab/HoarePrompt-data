Given the initial state:
- `j` is 1
- `n` is a positive integer
- `j` is greater than `n`
- `r` is an integer that allows the loop to proceed correctly (though `r` is not used in the print statement)

The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Since `j` is 1 and `j` is greater than `n`, `n` must be less than 1, but since `n` is specified to be a positive integer, the smallest possible value for `n` is 1. Therefore, the range will include only the number 1.

Output: **1**
