Postcondition: `cards` is a list of integers, and `dp[i][j]` is updated based on the following rules:
- If `cards.count(j + 1) == 0`, then `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`.
- If `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.
- If `cards.count(j + 1) > 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.

No other variables are affected.
