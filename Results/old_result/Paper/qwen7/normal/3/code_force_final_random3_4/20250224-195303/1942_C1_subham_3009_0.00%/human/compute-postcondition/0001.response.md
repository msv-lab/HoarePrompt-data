Output State: **t is an input integer, and we are inside the if statement if (__name__ == '__main__'):**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input is read within the if statement `if (__name__ == '__main__')`, the execution continues inside this block. The initial state's condition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) remains valid, and the value of `t` is now the integer input provided by the user.
