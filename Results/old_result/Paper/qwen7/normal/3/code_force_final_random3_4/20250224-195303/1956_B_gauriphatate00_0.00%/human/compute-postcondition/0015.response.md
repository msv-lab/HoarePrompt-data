Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `n` is `data[idx - data[idx]]`, `a` is a map of integers starting from `data[idx - data[idx]]` and having length `data[idx]`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(data[idx], a)`, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is now a list of integers created by mapping `int` over the slice of `data` from `idx` to `idx + n`.**

Explanation: The code updates `a` by mapping `int` over the slice of `data` from `idx` to `idx + n`. This means `a` is now a list of integers derived from the specified slice of `data`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their previous states.
