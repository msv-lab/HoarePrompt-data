Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `t`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
   - `i` is 1.
4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 2.
- `t` must still be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).

So, the updated state is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 2**
