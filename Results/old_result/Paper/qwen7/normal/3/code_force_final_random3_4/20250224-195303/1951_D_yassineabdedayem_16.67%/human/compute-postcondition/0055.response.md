Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `n` is calculated as `n - Min * Max * 59`.
- `k` is calculated as `k - 59 * (min(n // k, k))`.
- `rep` is set to 60.
- `number` is set to `max(int(n / k), k)`.
- `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` repeated 60 times.
- `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the final iteration.
- `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the final iteration.
- `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is not greater than `k` for the final iteration.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('NO')
```

This print statement will output the string 'NO' regardless of the values of the other variables and objects described in the initial state.

Output: **NO**
