Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) values for the given array `arr` and constructing a list `mex` based on these calculations. However, upon closer inspection, the logic in the program does not correctly implement the MEX calculation as defined in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array segment up to the current index. Instead, it seems to be incrementing `minn` and checking against `maxx`, which does not align with the MEX definition.

Given the problem's requirements and the provided execution summary, the program does not correctly compute the MEX values as needed. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
