Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of possible values of \( k \) based on Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received during the settling \( x \). Specifically, the program does not handle the periodic nature of the settling pattern correctly.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input: `10 2`

According to the problem description, the settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions. For \( k = 2 \), the settling pattern is:

```
k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2
```

For \( k = 3 \):

```
k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2
```

For \( k = 5 \):

```
k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2
```

For \( k = 6 \):

```
k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2
```

The program attempts to determine the number of valid \( k \) values using the functions `func_1` and some arithmetic checks, but it does not correctly account for the periodicity and the specific pattern of the settling sequence. Therefore, the program fails to provide the correct number of valid \( k \) values for the given inputs.
