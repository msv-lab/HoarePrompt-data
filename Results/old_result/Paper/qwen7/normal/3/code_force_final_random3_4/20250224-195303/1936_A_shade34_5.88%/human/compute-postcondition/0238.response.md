Output State: **`i` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all integers from `n` to `2n - 1` inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It is a method used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all buffered data is written to the terminal or file immediately. Since no variables are assigned new values or modified by this command, the initial state remains unchanged.
