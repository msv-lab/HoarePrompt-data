Output State: **`suit` is a key in the `suits` dictionary, the rank associated with `suit` in the `suits` dictionary is `None`.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
