The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, both of which are positive integers with the constraint 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. It iterates from `i = 1` to `m`, updating a counter `cnt` based on the values of `x` and `y` derived from `n` and `i`. After completing the iterations, the function returns 20, with `i` being 5, `x` being `n - 27`, and `y` being 25.
