Output State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is a value less than or equal to -26, `arr` contains the elements 1 and 26.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Since `lex` was initially a value less than or equal to 26, subtracting 26 from it results in a value that is less than or equal to -26. The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
