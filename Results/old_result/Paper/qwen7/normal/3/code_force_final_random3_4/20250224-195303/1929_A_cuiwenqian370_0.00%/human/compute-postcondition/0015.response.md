Output State: **`left` is 1, `right` must be at least 1, `new_arr` is a list containing the element `arr[1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `arr[left]` to `new_arr`. Given the initial state where `left` is 1, `new_arr` will contain the element `arr[1]` after the append operation. The value of `right` remains unchanged, and the condition that `right` must be at least 1 still holds true.
