Based on the initial state provided:

- `ppp` is explicitly given as 23.
- `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
- `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to keep the list `arr` sorted.
- `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned values from `arr[min(eli, LA)]` or `arr[max(eli, LA)]` depending on the condition `s > l`.
- `int(input())` is decremented by 1 from its current value, but this value is not directly printed.

The `print(l, r)` statement will print the values of `l` and `r`.

Since the values of `l` and `r` are derived from user input, their exact values are not known without the actual input. However, they are guaranteed to be integers.

Output: **l, r (where l and r are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers)**
