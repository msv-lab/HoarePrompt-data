Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1', where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5.**

However, since the problem statement does not specify what the function should do with the string, I will assume the function simply returns the string `a` as given in the constraints.
