Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are the integer values of the first, second, and third space-separated tokens from the next line `s`, respectively.

The print statement `print('NO')` will simply output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
