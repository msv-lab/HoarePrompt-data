Postcondition: `v1` is `len(vx) - 3`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 2`, `vx` is the list with either one element removed at index `v1` or two elements removed at indices `v1` and `v3`, where `v3` is the first element returned by `q(0)`, and `ops` is a list containing tuples indicating the removal operations, specifically `ops` includes `(v1, v2)` if only one element is removed, and includes `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` if two elements are removed.
