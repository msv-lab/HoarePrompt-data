Output State: **`palka` must contain at least one element; `d.get(i)` returns 1.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Since `d.get(i)` was previously returning `None`, this assignment changes its return value to `1`. The precondition that `palka` must contain at least one element remains unchanged.
