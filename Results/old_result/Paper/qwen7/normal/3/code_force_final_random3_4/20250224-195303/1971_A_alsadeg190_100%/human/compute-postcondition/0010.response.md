Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
   - `i` is 0
   - `x` is an input integer and `x` is greater than 0
   - `y` is the second integer from the input
   - If `x` is less than `y`, then `x` remains the same as the first integer from the input and `y` remains the second integer from the input. Otherwise, `y` is replaced by the second integer from the input.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range of `x`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.
   - Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head that changes, we need to update its value.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `t`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by the loop itself and remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, which is not specified here.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - `t`, `x`, and `y` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer and `x` is greater than 0, `y` is the second integer from the input.**
