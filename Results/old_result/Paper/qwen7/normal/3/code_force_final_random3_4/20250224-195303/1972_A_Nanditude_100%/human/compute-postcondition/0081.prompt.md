Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    for j in range(n):
        if b[j] < a[i]:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `cnt` is either 0, 1, or any value up to `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `n`. The variable `j` will also be equal to `n-1` because the loop runs through `range(n)`, meaning `j` will iterate from 0 to `n-1`. The value of `cnt` can range from 0 to `n-1` because each time `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, `cnt` is incremented. However, since `i` eventually becomes `n`, no further increments to `cnt` can occur, making the maximum value of `cnt` `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `cnt` will be incremented by the number of times `b[j]` is less than `a[i]` during the loop execution. The value of `i` will be incremented each time the condition `b[j] >= a[i]` is true, and `j` will iterate from 0 to `n-1` throughout the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` will be `n - 1`, `i` will be either the final value it reached during the loop execution or equal to `n` if it never incremented beyond `n-1`, and `cnt` will be the total count of times `b[j]` was found to be less than `a[i]` during the loop execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
