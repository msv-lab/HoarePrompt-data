The function processes input data related to a card game, specifically dealing with a set of cards and a trump suit. It updates the `suits` dictionary to have all values set to `None`, modifies the `trumps` list to have one less element, and constructs the `answers` list with formatted strings based on certain conditions. The function prints the contents of `answers` and `trumps` in a specific order and returns `None`.
