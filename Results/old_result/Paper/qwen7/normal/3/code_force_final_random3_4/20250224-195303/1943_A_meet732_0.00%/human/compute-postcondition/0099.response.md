Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in a`. The variables involved here are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cntl[i]` is increased by 1.
   - `i` is the next element in `a`.

3. **Determine the Next State for the Loop to Execute**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in `a`, it means that `i` has been incremented or moved to the next element in the sequence defined by `a`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be set to the next element in `a`.

Given this information, we need to update the state such that `i` points to the next element in `a`.

**State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
- `cntl[i]` is increased by 1 (this state does not change as it is not part of the loop head).
- `i` needs to be updated to the next element in `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now pointing to the next element in `a`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cntl[i]` is increased by 1, `i` is the next element in `a`**
