Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all edge cases and scenarios as described in the problem statement. Specifically:

1. **Handling Introverts and Extroverts Together**: The current logic does not correctly account for the fact that introverts need to be placed in separate tents, and extroverts need to be placed in full tents (either 3 people per tent).

2. **Universal Participants**: Universal participants can share tents with anyone, but the current implementation does not optimally use them to reduce the number of tents required.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        k = 0
        
        # Tents for introverts
        k += a
        
        # Remaining people after placing introverts
        remaining_people = b + c
        
        # Tents for extroverts
        # Each extrovert needs a tent with 2 others
        k += b // 3
        
        # Remaining people after placing extroverts
        remaining_people -= b
        
        # Tents for universals
        # Universals can fill any remaining spots
        k += remaining_people // 3
        
        # Remaining people after placing universals
        remaining_people %= 3
        
        # If there are any remaining people, it's impossible to place them
        if remaining_people > 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(k)

```

This corrected function ensures that:
- All introverts get their own tents.
- Extroverts are placed in full tents.
- Universals are used optimally to fill any remaining spots in the tents.

With this corrected approach, the function should now handle all test cases correctly.
