Output State: **`ops` will have been partially processed in reverse order, with the current tuple being the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`; `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) excluding `v1`; `v1` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 2`; `v2` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 2`; `v2` is less than or equal to 0; `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)` and `_` is the second element of the returned tuple from `q(0)` which is discarded.**

In this output state, the variable `v3` has been assigned the result of the function call `q(0)`, and the second element of the returned tuple from `q(0)` is discarded (denoted by `_`). All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
