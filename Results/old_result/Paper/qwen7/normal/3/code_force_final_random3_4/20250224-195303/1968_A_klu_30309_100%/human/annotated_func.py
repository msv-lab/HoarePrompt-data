#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000 for each x in test_cases.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        
        best_y = 1
        
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum

    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing the `best_y` value for each `x` in `test_cases` after the loop has executed all iterations. The loop processes each `x` in `test_cases` exactly once, finding the `y` that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` plus `y` (i.e., `gcd_val + y`). For each `x`, the corresponding `best_y` is appended to `results`. After all iterations, `results` will contain one element for each `x` in `test_cases`, representing the optimal `y` for each `x`.
    #
    #The other variables retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop: `max_sum` holds the highest `current_sum` found across all iterations, `x` holds the last `x` value processed, `y` holds the last `y` value processed, `gcd_val` holds the last calculated greatest common divisor, and `current_sum` holds the last calculated sum. However, these values are not included in the `results` list but are relevant for understanding the state of the loop's execution.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing the best `y` value for each `x` in `test_cases` after processing all iterations of the loop. Each `best_y` corresponds to the `y` that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` plus `y` (i.e., `gcd_val + y`) for its respective `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of positive integers between 2 and 1000. For each `x` in `test_cases`, it finds the best `y` that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` plus `y` (i.e., `gcd_val + y`). It returns a list `results` containing the best `y` value for each `x` in `test_cases`.
