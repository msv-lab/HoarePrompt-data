Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game rules and does not account for Nene's optimal strategy to minimize the player's score. Specifically, the dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` does not accurately model the game's turns and the strategic decisions made by Nene.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

```
3
1 1
```

Here, you have two cards with the number 1. According to the problem description, Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. In this scenario, the optimal play would be for you to play one of the cards with 1, scoring 1 point, and Nene would then play the other card with 1, scoring 1 point. Therefore, the maximum number of points you can get is 0.

However, the provided program incorrectly calculates the result as 1. This is because the dynamic programming approach does not properly handle the alternating turns and the strategic decision-making process of Nene. Specifically, the logic inside the nested loops does not correctly simulate the game's progression and the optimal moves for Nene.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
