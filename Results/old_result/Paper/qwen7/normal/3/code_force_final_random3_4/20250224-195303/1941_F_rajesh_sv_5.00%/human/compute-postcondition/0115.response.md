Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `total` is undefined, `students` is undefined, `left` must be less than `right` plus `f`, `h` is `mid`.**

The code `h = mid` assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `h`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
