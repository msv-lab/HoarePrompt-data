Output State: **`results` is a list containing the value of `count`, which is the sum of all values obtained from `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each `num` in `arr`; `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key `(-num % x, num % y)` is mapped to its frequency (i.e., how many times it appears as a result of processing elements in `arr` through the loop); `current_key` is the last computed key `num % x, num % y` from the final iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The line of code `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` to the list `results`. This means that `count` is added as the last element in the `results` list. The values of `residue_map` and `current_key` remain unchanged because the code does not modify them directly. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `results` list with the new value of `count` and retains the original `residue_map` and `current_key` from the previous state.
