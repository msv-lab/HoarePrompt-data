Postcondition: `i` is 3, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`, and `ans` retains its original value based on the condition `a[2] - a[1]` if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0`. If the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 != 0`, the postcondition remains unchanged as there is no else part provided.
