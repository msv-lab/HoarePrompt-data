Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input from the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found in `arr`, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found in `arr`.**

The code `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` reverses the string `arr` and finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string. This gives us the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the original string `arr`. If '1' is not found, it returns -1. The other variables remain unchanged.
