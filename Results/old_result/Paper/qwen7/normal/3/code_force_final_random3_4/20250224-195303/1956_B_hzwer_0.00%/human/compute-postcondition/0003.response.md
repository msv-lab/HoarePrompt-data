Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1), initialized with 0's; `dp[n-1][0]` is 0.**

The code sets the value of `dp[n-1][0]` to 0. All other elements of the `dp` list remain unchanged and are still initialized with 0's. The values of `cards`, `t`, and `n` are not affected by this line of code.
