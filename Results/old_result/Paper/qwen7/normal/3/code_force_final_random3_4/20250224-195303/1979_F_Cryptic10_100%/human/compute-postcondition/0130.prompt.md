Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a lambda function `q` is defined which prints a query and reads a list of integers as input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    vx, ops = set(i for i in range(1, int(input()) + 1)), []
    while len(vx) > 2:
        v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
        vx.remove(v1)
        if v2 > 0:
            ops += [(v1, v2)]
        else:
            v3, _ = q(0)
            vx.remove(v3)
            ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]
    p1, p2 = list(vx), []
    for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
        (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)
    print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The list `ops` will have been fully processed in reverse order. For each tuple `(v1, v2)` in `ops[::-1]`, if the last element of the first tuple is equal to `v2`, then `v1` will be appended to the first tuple. If the last element of the first tuple is not equal to `v2`, the first tuple remains unchanged. This process will continue for all tuples in `ops[::-1]`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the first tuple in `ops` will have had its last element updated as many times as there are tuples in `ops` where the condition `p1[-1] == v2` is met. All other tuples in `ops` will remain unaltered.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `vx` is a set containing the two largest integers from the original set, `p1` is a list of the original elements in `vx`, `p2` is a list containing all elements added during the loop executions, `ops` is a list of tuples that has been fully processed, `v1` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops`, and `(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1)` appends `v1` to `p2` if the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`, otherwise it appends `v1` to `p1`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `p1` will still hold the original elements of the two largest integers from the original set, `p2` will contain all elements that were appended during each iteration of the loop, and `ops` will be an empty list since all tuples have been processed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, both being the last two elements of the original `vx` before the loop started; `p1` is a list of the original elements in `vx`; `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values appended according to the conditions inside the loop; `ops` is a list containing all tuples from the original operations but in reverse order; `v1` and `v2` are undefined.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `vx` remains unchanged as it only contains the last two elements of the original set. The lists `p1` and `p2` accumulate values based on the conditions specified within the loop. Specifically, `p2` collects `v1` values when the condition `(p1[-1] == v2)` is met, and `p1` collects `v1` values otherwise. The list `ops` retains all the tuples from the original operations but in reverse order, as the loop processes them in reverse. Variables `v1` and `v2` are no longer defined after the loop as they are placeholders for the elements within the tuples in `ops`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
