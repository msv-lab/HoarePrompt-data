Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\), `i` is 3, `answers` is a list with 'Bob' appended to it, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

In this output state, the variable `test_cases` remains unchanged, `i` remains 3, `answers` now contains the string 'Bob' added to its list, and `clues` retains its original list of integers obtained from the input string.
