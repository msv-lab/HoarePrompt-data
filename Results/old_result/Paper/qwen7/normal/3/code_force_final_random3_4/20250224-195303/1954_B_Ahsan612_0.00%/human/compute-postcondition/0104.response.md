Output State: **`minn` is infinity, `same` is 2, `num` is `ar[0]`, `ar` is updated with integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 1, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The variable `same` was initially set to 1. After executing `same += 1`, `same` is incremented by 1, making its new value 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
