Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is either `mid` or `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` is the index such that all elements in `D` before index `l` are less than `left - f`, and `l` is the smallest index where `D[l]` is greater than or equal to `left - f`, and `l` is less than `h`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`**

Explanation: The code reassigns the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` to be `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` respectively. However, since the initial values of these variables are already defined as `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f`, they remain unchanged. The other variables (`h`, `l`, and `mid`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so their conditions and relationships remain the same as the initial state.
