Output State: **`k` is -1, `i` is `n - 2`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * 0 + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * 0 + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `b = p[b] - 1` updates the value of `b` to `p[b] - 1`. All other variables (`k`, `i`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The most internal loop or if statement is also broken as per the initial postcondition.
