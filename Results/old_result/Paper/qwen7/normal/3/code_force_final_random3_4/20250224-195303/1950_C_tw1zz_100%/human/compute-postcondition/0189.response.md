Postcondition: `h1` is a string representing the hour part of a time, `m1` is the string converted from the second input split by `:`, and `time` is set to 'AM'. Specifically, if `h` is '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '00', '22', or '01', then `h1` is set to '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '00', '22', or '01' respectively, and `time` is set to 'AM'. If `h` is any other value, `h1` remains unchanged and `time` is set to 'AM'.
