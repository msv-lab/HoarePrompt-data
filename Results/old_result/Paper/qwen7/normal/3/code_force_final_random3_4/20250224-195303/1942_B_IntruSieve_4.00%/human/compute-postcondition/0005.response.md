Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head consists of the variable `i` and the range function arguments `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `i`: This variable is initialized to 0 in the loop head.
   - `n`: This is the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `mex` is an empty list.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) (and its value is input from the user).
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.
- `minn` is 0.
- `maxx` is 0.

The only variables that affect the loop execution are `n` and `i`. Since `i` is initialized to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`. However, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` being greater than 0.

**State:**
**`n` must be greater than 0**
