The function processes a list of integers `nums` and handles a series of queries. It first identifies segments in `nums` where the elements are the same and stores these segments along with their starting indices. Then, for each query defined by indices `l` and `r`, it determines the segment within the specified range and outputs the start and end indices of that segment, or `-1 -1` if no valid segment is found.
