Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variables involved in the loop head are `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `data` is unchanged
   - `idx` is `idx + n`
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - n]`
   - `a` is a list of integers starting from `data[idx - n]` and having length `n`
   - `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a)`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 (since `range(t)` will stop when `t` reaches 0).

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + n`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - n]`, `a` is a list of integers starting from `data[idx - n]` and having length `n`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a)`, `t` is `t - 1`**
