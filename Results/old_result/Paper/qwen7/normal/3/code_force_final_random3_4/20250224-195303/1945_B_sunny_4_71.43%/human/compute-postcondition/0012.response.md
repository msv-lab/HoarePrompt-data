Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `A` is equal to `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is equal to `int(m / b) + 1, `a` and `b` are updated to new input integers, `m` is updated to a new input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `m` respectively. It does not affect the values of `t`, `A`, and `B`. Therefore, `t` remains 0, and `A` and `B` are recalculated based on the new values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.
