Output State: **`ans` is 1, `x` is equal to `y`, `a` is greater than `y`, and `y` is equal to `a`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (likely 0 since it's not initialized elsewhere in the given snippet). The other variables (`x`, `a`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial state where `x` is equal to `y`, `a` is greater than `y`, and `y` is equal to `a`.
