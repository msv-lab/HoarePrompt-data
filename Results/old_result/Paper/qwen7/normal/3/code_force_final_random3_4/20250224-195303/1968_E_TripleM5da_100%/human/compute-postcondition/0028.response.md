Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(3, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - Initially, `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 5.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over values of `i` starting from 3 up to `n` (inclusive). For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 3, but since `i` is set to `n` initially, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. However, given the additional constraint that `n` must be greater than 5, we know that `n` must be greater than 5 for the loop to start.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is set to `n` initially, and the loop starts with `i` being 3, `n` must be at least 3. But due to the constraint, `n` must be greater than 5.
   - Therefore, `i` will start from a value that is at least 3, but since `i` is set to `n` initially, `n` must be greater than 5.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 5**
