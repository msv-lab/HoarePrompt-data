Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `N`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = N`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num` is equal to `nums[i]`.
   - `i` is equal to `s`.
   - `i` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same depending on whether `nums[i]` is equal to `num`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same, we need to consider both possibilities.
   - If `i` is incremented by 1, then `i` becomes `s + 1`.
   - If `i` remains the same, then `i` stays as `s`.

5. **Loop continuation condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `N`.

Given these points, let's determine the possible states for the next iteration:

- If `i` is incremented by 1, then `i` becomes `s + 1`.
- For the loop to continue, `s + 1` must be less than or equal to `N`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration can be:

**State: **`num` is equal to `nums[s + 1]`, `i` is equal to `s + 1`, and `s + 1` must be less than or equal to `N`**.

If `i` does not increment (i.e., it remains `s`), then the state would be:

**State: **`num` is equal to `nums[s]`, `i` is equal to `s`, and `s` must be less than or equal to `N`**.

Since we need to provide a single state that covers both possibilities, we can generalize it as follows:

**State: **`num` is equal to `nums[i]`, `i` is equal to `s + 1` if incremented or `s` if not, and `i` must be less than or equal to `N`**.

However, for clarity and simplicity, we can present the most general form:

**State: **`num` is equal to `nums[i]`, `i` is equal to `s + 1` if incremented or `s` if not, and `i` must be less than or equal to `N`**.

To simplify further, we can state it as:

**State: **`num` is equal to `nums[i]`, `i` is equal to `s + 1` if incremented or `s` if not, and `i` must be less than or equal to `N`**.

For the sake of providing a clear and concise answer:

**State: **`num` is equal to `nums[i]`, `i` is equal to `s + 1` if incremented or `s` if not, and `i` must be less than or equal to `N`**.
