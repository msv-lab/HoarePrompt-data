The loop condition in the given `while` loop is `heap[0] <= current_median`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` must be true.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `operations` is 4
- `smallest` is the smallest element in `heap` after removing the smallest element
- `heap[0]` is now `smallest + 1`
- The new smallest element is the new root of the heap

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check the value of `heap[0]` against `current_median`.

Given that `heap[0]` is now `smallest + 1`, for the loop to continue, `smallest + 1` must be less than or equal to `current_median`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `smallest + 1 <= current_median`.

Since `smallest` is the smallest element in the heap after removing the smallest element, and `heap[0]` is now `smallest + 1`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `smallest`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `smallest + 1 <= current_median`.

State: **`operations` is 4, `smallest` is such that `smallest + 1 <= current_median`, and the new smallest element is the new root of the heap**
