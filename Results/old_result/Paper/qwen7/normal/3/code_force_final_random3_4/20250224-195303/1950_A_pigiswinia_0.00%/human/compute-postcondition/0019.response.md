Based on the initial state provided:

- `a`, `b`, `c` are integers from input.
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `i` is `t-1`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'PEAK'`. Since no specific values for `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, or `i` are required to determine the output of this particular `print` statement, the output will be the string `'PEAK'` itself.

Output: **'PEAK'**
