Output State: **`test_cases` is used to assign its i-th element to `n` and `arr`; `arr` is sorted; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is `arr[median_index:]`; `heap` is converted into a min-heap; `operations` is 3; `smallest` is the smallest element in `heap` after removing the smallest element; `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median` and the new smallest element is the new root of the heap.**

Explanation: The code `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to `smallest`. After popping, the heap property is maintained, meaning the new root (heap[0]) is the smallest element in the remaining heap, and it must still be less than or equal to `current_median`. All other variables remain unchanged.
