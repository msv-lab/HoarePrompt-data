Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment until it reaches `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `start` is an integer.
- `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is an input integer.

We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `t` must be greater than 0. The values of `start` and `end` do not affect the loop's execution directly, but they are given as part of the context.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` being greater than 0.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
