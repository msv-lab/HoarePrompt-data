Postcondition: `is_already_stairs` is True, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, where n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 18, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `res` is a list that will store the operations performed, `j` is 0, `i` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 17, and the value of `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`.
