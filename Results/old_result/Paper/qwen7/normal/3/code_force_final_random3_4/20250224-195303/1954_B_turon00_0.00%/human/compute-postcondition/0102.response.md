Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`; `cnt` is reset to 0; `tmp` remains equal to `a[0]`; the set `aa` contains all unique elements from the list `a`; variable `n` remains as the input integer; `t` is `t - i - 1` where `i` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is reset to 0 after each iteration where `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` represents the count of consecutive occurrences of the same element in the list `a`. The other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
