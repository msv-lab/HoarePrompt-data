Output State: **All keys in the `suits` dictionary are set to `None`; `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is a list containing 16 unique strings, each formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump'.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over each suit ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S') and for each non-None `rank`, it appends a formatted string to the `answers` list and removes the suit from the `trumps` list. Since there are 4 suits and up to 16 possible ranks (though typically only 13 are used), the loop will fully process all ranks for all suits, resulting in 16 entries in the `answers` list. By the end of the loop, all ranks in `suits` will have been matched with a trump suit (if available), and the `trumps` list will be exhausted.
