Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `ps` - 1 set to 1, `num_iterations` is decremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the original `n`, `k` is the integer value of the original `k`, `pb` remains at the final value it was set to after the last iteration, `ps` is the integer value of the original `ps`, `p` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `pathb` is a list containing all the elements added during each iteration of the loop, `paths` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    paths.append(a[ps - 1])
    ps = p[ps - 1]
    if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `ps` - 1 set to 1; `num_iterations` is decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of the original `n`; `k` is the integer value of the original `k`; `pb` remains at the final value it was set to after the last iteration; `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]`; `p` is a list of integers entered by the user; `a` is a list of integers entered by the user; `pathb` is a list containing all the elements added during each iteration of the loop; `paths` is a list with the element `a[ps - 1]` appended; and the condition `vis[ps - 1] == 1` is true, leading to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `ps` - 1 set to 1; `num_iterations` remains decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of the original `n`; `k` is the integer value of the original `k`; `pb` remains at the final value it was set to after the last iteration; `ps` remains updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]`; `p` is a list of integers entered by the user; `a` is a list of integers entered by the user; `pathb` is a list containing all the elements added during each iteration of the loop; `paths` now contains the element `a[ps - 1]` appended to its previous content; if `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `ps` - 1 set to 1; `num_iterations` remains decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of the original `n`; `k` remains at the final value it was set to after the last iteration; `pb` remains at the final value it was set to after the last iteration; `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]`; `p` is a list of integers entered by the user; `a` is a list of integers entered by the user; `pathb` is a list containing all the elements added during each iteration of the loop; `paths` now contains the element `a[ps - 1]` appended to its previous content; if `vis[ps - 1] == 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
