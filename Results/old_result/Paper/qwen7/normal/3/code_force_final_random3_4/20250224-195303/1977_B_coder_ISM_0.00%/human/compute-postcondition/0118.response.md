Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and conditions**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(30)`. This means `i` will iterate from 0 to 29.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1 (since it was 0 in the first iteration and now it's 1).
   - `30` is 30 (this seems like a typo or unnecessary information; we'll ignore it).
   - `s` is a list. The postcondition states that if `x` and \(2^i\) are non-zero, then `s` is a list containing '1'. Otherwise, `s` is a list containing '0'.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will continue if `i < 30`.
   - The loop will increment `i` by 1 in each iteration.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented from 1 to 2.
   - The value of `30` is irrelevant to the loop condition, so it remains unchanged.
   - For the next iteration, the list `s` should be determined based on the new value of `i`.

5. **Postcondition for the next iteration**:
   - If `x` and \(2^2\) (which is 4) are non-zero, then `s` should contain '1'.
   - Otherwise, `s` should contain '0'.

Since the exact values of `x` are not given, we cannot definitively determine the content of `s`. However, we know that `i` will be 2 in the next iteration.

**Final State**:
- `i` is 2.
- `30` is 30 (unchanged).
- `s` is a list that will depend on the values of `x` and \(2^2\).

State: **`i` is 2, `30` is 30, and `s` is a list. If `x` and \(2^2\) are non-zero, then `s` is a list containing '1'. Otherwise, `s` is a list containing '0'.**
