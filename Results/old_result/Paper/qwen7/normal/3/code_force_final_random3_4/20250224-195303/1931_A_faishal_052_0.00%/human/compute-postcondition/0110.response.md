Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(2)`. The variables involved here are `j` and the range object.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop variables**:
   - `j` will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
   - The range object will generate values from 0 to 1 (inclusive).

3. **Adjust the states of the relevant variables**:
   - Since `j` is initialized to 0, we need to set `j` to 0.
   - The range object will generate values from 0 to 1, so no adjustment is needed for the range object itself, but we need to ensure that the loop can execute by setting `j` to the starting value.

4. **Consider other variables**:
   - `i`, `cases`, `arr`, and `lex` are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` to 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`j` is 0**
