Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `j`. The other variables mentioned in the postcondition (`nx`, `i`, `n`, `sa`, and `xx`) are not part of the loop head.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n + 1`. Therefore, at the start of each iteration, `j` will increment by 1.

3. **Determine the New State of `j`**: Since the loop starts with `j = 1` and increments by 1 each time, if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Check the Range Condition**: The condition for `nx` being 'F' or 'S' involves `i` and `j` being within the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`. However, since we are only adjusting the state of `j` and not `i` or `sa`, we don't need to worry about this condition changing based on the current value of `j`.

5. **Adjust the State**: The only variable that changes in the loop head is `j`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `k` (where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration). For the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `nx` is a string, either 'F' or 'S'.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The character at position `j - 1` in `xx[i]` is either not '?' or '?'.
- If either `i` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.

Since `j` is incremented by 1, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `nx` remains the same ('F' or 'S').
- `i` remains `n + 1`.
- `n` remains the same (greater than or equal to 1).
- The character at position `j` in `xx[i]` is either not '?' or '?'.
- The condition for `nx` being 'F' or 'S' still holds based on the values of `i` and `j` relative to `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`.

State: **`nx` is a string, either 'F' or 'S', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the character at position `j` in `xx[i]` is either not '?' or '?', and if either `i` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.**
