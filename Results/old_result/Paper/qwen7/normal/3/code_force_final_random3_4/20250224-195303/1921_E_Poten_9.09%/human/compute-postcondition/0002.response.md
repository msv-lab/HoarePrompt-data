State: **`test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `test_cases` must be greater than 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `test_cases`.
2. For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `test_cases`.
3. Before the loop starts, `i` is initialized to 0.
4. Since `i` starts at 0, `test_cases` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
5. The variable `answers` is not involved in the loop condition and its initial state is fine as it is an empty list.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `test_cases` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
