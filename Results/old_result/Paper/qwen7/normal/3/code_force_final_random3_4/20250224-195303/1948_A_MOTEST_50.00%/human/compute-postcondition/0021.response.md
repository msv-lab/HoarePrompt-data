Output State: `j` is equal to `n // 2`, `ans` is the concatenation of `s[x-1] * 2` for each iteration, `x` is equal to `n // 2`.

Explanation: Since the loop runs `n // 2` times (as indicated by the condition `for j in range(n // 2)`), after all iterations, `j` will be equal to `n // 2`. The variable `ans` will contain the concatenated result of `s[x] * 2` for each iteration, starting from `s[x-1] * 2` and increasing `x` by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, `ans` will be the sum of `s[x] * 2` for all iterations. Finally, `x` will be equal to `n // 2` because it is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
