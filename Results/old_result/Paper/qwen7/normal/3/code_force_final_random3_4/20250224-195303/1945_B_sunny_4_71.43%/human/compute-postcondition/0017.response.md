Output State: `t` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `A` is equal to `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is equal to `int(m / b) + 1`.

This means that after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` has reached 0, indicating that there are no more inputs left to process. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` from the last iteration are retained, and the calculations for `A` and `B` based on these values have been performed and printed.
