Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. The logic in the program is flawed because it does not account for the correct distance to the nearest free cell to the left for each chip.

For example, consider the input:
```
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```

The program's output is `1`, but the correct output should be `1`. Here's how the program fails:

1. It finds the first occurrence of '1' at index `1` (considering 0-based indexing).
2. It finds the last occurrence of '1' at index `6`.
3. It reverses the string and finds the first occurrence of '1' at index `2` from the end, which is correct.
4. It extracts the substring `arr[x:n - y]` which is `111011`.
5. It counts the number of zeros in this substring, which is `1`.

However, the program does not correctly handle the distances to the nearest free cells to the left for each chip. For instance, in the input `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`, the chip at index `3` needs to move to the nearest free cell to its left, which is index `1`. This requires one operation. Similarly, the chip at index `5` needs to move to the nearest free cell to its left, which is index `3`. This also requires one operation. Therefore, the total number of operations needed is `2`, not `1`.

To fix this, the program needs to calculate the distance of each chip to the nearest free cell to its left and sum these distances.
