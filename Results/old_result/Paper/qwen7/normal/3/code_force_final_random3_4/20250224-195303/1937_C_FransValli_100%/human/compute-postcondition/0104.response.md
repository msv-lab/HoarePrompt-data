Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 0.
   - `n` is not explicitly given its value in the initial state but is used as an upper bound for the loop.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, for the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be incremented to 1 (the loop starts from 1).
   - The value of `n` must be such that `i < n` is true when `i` is 1. This means `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

State: **`mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 1, and `res` is the final input string from the user.**
