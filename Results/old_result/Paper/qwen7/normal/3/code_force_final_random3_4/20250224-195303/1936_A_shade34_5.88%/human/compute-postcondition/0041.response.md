Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a string input from the user.
- `mak` is undefined.
- `pans` is undefined.
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- `n` is the same as before the previous iteration.

The `print` statement is:

```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Let's break down the values that will be printed:

- `'?'`: This is a literal string and will be printed as is.
- `mak`: It is explicitly stated that `mak` is undefined. In Python, printing an undefined variable results in `None` being printed.
- `mak2`: Similarly, `mak2` is also undefined and will be printed as `None`.
- `i`: It is defined as `k + 1`, but since `k` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact value. However, it is clear that `i` is `k + 1`.
- `mak2`: Again, this is `None`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **'? None None k + 1 None'**
