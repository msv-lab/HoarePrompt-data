Output State: **`i` is 6, `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`, `max_diff` remains unchanged, `next_max_diff` remains unchanged**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `diff` to `A[i] - A[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is initially 6, `diff` is now updated to `A[6] - A[5]`. The values of `max_diff` and `next_max_diff` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
