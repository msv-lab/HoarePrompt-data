Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n // 2 - 1`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `ans` is 'AAAS'.
   - `x` is 2.
4. **Adjust the state based on the loop head variables**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` must be less than `n // 2 - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes `j + 1`.
   - Therefore, `j` should be `n // 2 - 2` (since it was `n // 2 - 2` before the increment).
5. **Ensure other variables remain unchanged**: The variables `t`, `n`, `ans`, and `x` do not change within the loop head.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is 'AAAS', `j` is `n // 2 - 2`**
