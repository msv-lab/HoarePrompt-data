### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** Reads an integer `n` and a binary string `a` of length `n`.
   - **Processing:**
     - Constructs a list `S` where each element `[x, y]` represents the cumulative counts of '0's (`x`) and '1's (`y`) up to that point in the string `a`.
     - Iterates through the string `a` to populate `S`.
     - For each position `i` in the string `a`, calculates the number of '0's (`left`) and '1's (`right`) on the left and right sides of `i`, respectively.
     - Checks if the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` are met, where `lsum` is the total count of '0's and '1's up to position `i`, and `rsum` is the total count of '1's from position `i+1` to the end.
     - Updates the variable `ans` to store the index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference `|n / 2 - i|` while satisfying the conditions.
   - **Output:** Prints the index `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2()` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** Does not accept any parameters.
   - **Processing:**
     - Repeatedly calls `func_1()` three times based on user input.
     - Continues calling `func_1()` until the user inputs a non-positive integer.
   - **Output:** Calls `func_1()` three times for each test case.

3. **Overall Program Analysis:**
   - The program correctly processes each test case by calling `func_1()` three times.
   - `func_1()` correctly computes the optimal position `i` for the road based on the given conditions.
   - The program handles multiple test cases as specified.

Given the problem statement and the provided functions, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to find the optimal position for the road. The functions are structured to handle the problem as described, and the conditions and constraints are appropriately checked.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution states.

**Correctness: True**
