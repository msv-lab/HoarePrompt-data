Based on the initial state provided:

- The variable `i` is now equal to `n`.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as an input integer.
- The variable `k` remains unchanged.
- The `array` remains a list containing numbers from 1 to `n`.
- The `answer` list contains elements appended based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, for each iteration, if `(-1 < array[i] - array[i-1] < 1)` and `(-1 < array[i+1] - array[i] < 1)`, then `array[i]` is appended to `answer`.

Given the conditions inside the loop, the `answer` list will contain elements from the `array` where the difference between consecutive elements is exactly 1. This means the `answer` list will contain a sequence of consecutive numbers from the original `array`.

For example, if `n = 5` and the `array` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the `answer` list would be `[2, 3, 4]` because these are the elements where the difference between consecutive elements is exactly 1.

Therefore, the `print(*answer)` statement will print the elements of the `answer` list.

Output: **2 3 4 (where the elements in the answer list are consecutive numbers with a difference of 1 from the original array, depending on the specific values of the array)**
