Output State: **`minn` is 1, `same` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `ar[i-1]` equals `num`, `num` is either `ar[0]` or `ar[i-1]` based on the condition, `ar` is updated with integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 5, and len(ar) must be greater than 4.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 4, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 5. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
