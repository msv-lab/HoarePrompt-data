Output State: **`minn` is 2, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[5]`, `ar` is updated with the first 6 integers from the input, `i` is 5**.

Explanation: The line `same = 1` sets the variable `same` to 1, overriding its previous value which was either 2 or 1 depending on whether `ar[4]` equals `num`. All other variables remain unchanged.
