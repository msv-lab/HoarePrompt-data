Output State: **`prev` is equal to `curr`, `tree` contains the elements `s`, `curr`, and `curr` is the first element of `nodes[curr]` that is not equal to `e`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` to be the first element of `nodes[curr]` that is not equal to `e`. Since `curr` was previously the first element of `nodes[prev]` that is not equal to `e`, and no other variables have been affected, `prev` remains unchanged. The value of `curr` changes to the first element of `nodes[curr]` that is not equal to `e`. The list `tree` and its contents remain unchanged.
