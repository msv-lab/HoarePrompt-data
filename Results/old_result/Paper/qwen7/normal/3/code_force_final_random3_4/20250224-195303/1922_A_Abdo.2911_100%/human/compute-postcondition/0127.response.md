Postcondition: `i` is `n - 1 + t`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is False, `c` is an input string from user input, and either the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to the current value of `b[i]` and the loop or if statement has been broken, or the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i]`.
