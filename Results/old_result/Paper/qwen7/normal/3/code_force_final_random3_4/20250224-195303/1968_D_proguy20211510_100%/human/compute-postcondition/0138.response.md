Output State: `vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1, `i` is equal to the length of `paths`, `k` is equal to the length of `paths`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the loop iterations, `ress` holds the final maximum value between all `curr` values, `pathb` contains all elements added until `vis[pb - 1] == 1`, `paths` is an empty list, `n` is an integer from the first input string, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop, `ps` is an integer from the fourth input string, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the first input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.

This output state indicates that the loop has completed its execution when `vis[pb - 1]` becomes 1, meaning that the index `pb - 1` has been visited. The variable `pathb` will contain all the elements added during the loop iterations up to the point where the loop breaks. All other variables retain their values as they were after the third iteration, since no further changes occur outside the loop.
