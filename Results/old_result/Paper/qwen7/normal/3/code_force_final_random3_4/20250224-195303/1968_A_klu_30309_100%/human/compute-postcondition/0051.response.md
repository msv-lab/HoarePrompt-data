Output State: **`gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x-2` and `x-3`, `y` is `x-3`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x-2)`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + (x-2)`, and `best_y` is `x-2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `gcd_val` to be the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, where `y` is `x-3`. The other variables (`y`, `current_sum`, `max_sum`, and `best_y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
