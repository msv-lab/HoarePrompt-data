Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to len(vx) - 4, `v1` is removed from `vx`, and `v2` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code removes `v1` from the set `vx`. Since `v1` was an element of `vx`, its removal changes the size of `vx` by one. The length of `vx` is now reduced by one, meaning the set now contains integers from 1 to `len(vx) - 4`. The values of `t`, `n`, `v2`, and the condition that `len(vx)` must be greater than 2 remain unchanged.
