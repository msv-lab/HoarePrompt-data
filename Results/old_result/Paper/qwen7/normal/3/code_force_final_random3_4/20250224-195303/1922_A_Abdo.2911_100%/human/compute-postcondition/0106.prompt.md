Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `possible` is False, `t` is `k - 1`, `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `c` is the input string after stripping whitespace
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        if c[i] != a[i]:
            possible = True
            break
    elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
        continue
    else:
        possible = True
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is `t + 1`. If the value of `a[i]` is not equal to the value of `c[i]`, then `possible` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. If the value of `a[i]` is equal to the value of `c[i]`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `c[0]` is either equal to `a[0]` or `b[0]`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `possible` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is still `t + 1`, and either `c[1]` equals `a[1]` or `b[1]`, or `possible` is True and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is `t + 1`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then `possible` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then no specific changes are made beyond the initial precondition. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
