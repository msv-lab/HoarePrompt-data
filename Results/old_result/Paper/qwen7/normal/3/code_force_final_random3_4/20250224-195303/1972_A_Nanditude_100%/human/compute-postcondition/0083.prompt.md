You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. a and b are arrays of length n, where a and b are sorted in non-decreasing order, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        i = 0
        
        for j in range(n):
            if b[j] < a[i]:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: Output State: `cnt` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is either `n` or the last value it reached during the loop execution, `j` is `n - 1`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `n`. The variable `j` will be equal to `n-1` because the loop runs through `range(n)`, meaning `j` will iterate from 0 to `n-1`. The value of `cnt` will be the total count of times `b[j]` was found to be less than `a[i]` during the loop execution for all iterations of the outer loop. Since the outer loop runs `t` times, `cnt` will accumulate the counts from each iteration, resulting in a non-negative integer value.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two arrays, `a` and `b`, of length `n`, where both arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order. The function returns a value based on the comparison of elements in these arrays.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
