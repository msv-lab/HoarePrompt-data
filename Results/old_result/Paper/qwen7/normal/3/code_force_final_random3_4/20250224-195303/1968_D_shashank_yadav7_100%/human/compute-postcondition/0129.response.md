Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`**

Explanation: The variable `sp` is incremented by the value of `a[s]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
