Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a string.
- `done` is `True`.
- `count` is `j`.
- `count2` is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged.
- `j` is `n`.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, we continue the loop.

The print statement is `print('YES')`.

Since the print statement directly prints the string `'YES'`, and no other variables or objects are involved in this specific print statement, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
