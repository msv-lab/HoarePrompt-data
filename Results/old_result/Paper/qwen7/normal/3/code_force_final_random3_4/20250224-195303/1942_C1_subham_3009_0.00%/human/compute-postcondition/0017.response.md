Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer; `arr` is a list of integers where each element is converted from the corresponding element in the input string split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input().split()` takes user input as a string and splits it into a list of substrings based on spaces. These substrings are then converted to integers and stored in the list `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
