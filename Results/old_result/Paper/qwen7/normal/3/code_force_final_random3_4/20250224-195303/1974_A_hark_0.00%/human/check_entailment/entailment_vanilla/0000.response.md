Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function simply returns the smaller of two values `a` and `b`.
   - It is not used anywhere in the program, so it does not affect the logic directly but could be useful in other parts of the code.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons.
   - The logic inside this function is complex and involves several steps:
     - First, it checks if both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the remaining space after placing some 1x1 icons.
     - Then, it adjusts `x` and recalculates the number of screens needed.
     - Finally, it prints the total number of screens required.
   - The key part of the logic is the calculation of how many 2x2 icons can fit into the remaining space after placing some 1x1 icons. However, the logic seems flawed because it incorrectly calculates the number of 1x1 icons that can fit into the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_2` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases.

### Detailed Explanation of the Flawed Logic in `func_2`:

- The logic to calculate the number of screens needed when both `x` and `y` are greater than 0 is incorrect. Specifically, the calculation `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is wrong. It assumes that each 2x2 icon takes up 15 cells, which is incorrect since each 2x2 icon actually takes up 4 cells.
- The calculation `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` is also incorrect because it does not account for the placement of 1x1 icons correctly.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the grid.
2. Subtract the space taken by these 2x2 icons from the total grid space.
3. Calculate how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space.
4. Sum up the number of screens needed for both types of icons.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 0 and y == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        # Calculate the number of 2x2 icons that can fit
        num_screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil((5 * 3 * y) / (2 * 2))
        remaining_space = 5 * 3 - (num_screens_for_2x2 * 2 * 2)
        # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit in the remaining space
        num_screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil(remaining_space / 15)
        # Total number of screens needed
        total_screens = num_screens_for_2x2 + num_screens_for_1x1
        print(total_screens)
```

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in calculating the number of screens needed. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
