Output State: **`possible` is False, `t` is `k - 1`, `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `c` is the input string after stripping whitespace**.

Explanation: The line `possible = False` sets the variable `possible` to `False`. The values of `t`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
