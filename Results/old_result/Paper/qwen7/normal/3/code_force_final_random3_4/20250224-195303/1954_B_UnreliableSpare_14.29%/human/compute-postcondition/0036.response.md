Postcondition: **`flag` remains `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `i` is `n`, `cnt` is increased by 1, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum between `ans` and `cnt` if `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`**.

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts. In both cases, `flag` remains `False`, `t` and `n` retain their initial constraints, `a` is a list of `n` integers within the specified range, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum between `ans` and `cnt` if `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`.
