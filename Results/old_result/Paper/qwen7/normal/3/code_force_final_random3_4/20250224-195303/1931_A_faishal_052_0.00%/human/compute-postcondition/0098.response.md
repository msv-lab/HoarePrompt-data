Output State: **`cases` is 3, `arr` is one of the following lists: `[1, 1, 1]`, `[1, 1, 26]`, `[1, 26, 1]`, `[1, 26, 26]`, `[26, 1, 1]`, `[26, 1, 26]`, `[26, 26, 1]`, `[26, 26, 26]`, `j` is 2, `lex` is appended to `arr`, and `arr` is sorted.**

Explanation: The `sort()` method sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Depending on the initial value of `arr`, the sorted list will be one of the following: `[1, 1, 1]`, `[1, 1, 26]`, `[1, 26, 1]`, `[1, 26, 26]`, `[26, 1, 1]`, `[26, 1, 26]`, `[26, 26, 1]`, `[26, 26, 26]`. The variable `j` remains unchanged, and `lex` is appended to `arr`, but since `sort()` modifies the list in place, the final state of `arr` is sorted.
