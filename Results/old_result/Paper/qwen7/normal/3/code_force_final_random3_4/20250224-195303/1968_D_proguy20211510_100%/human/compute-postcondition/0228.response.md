Output State: **`num_iterations` is decremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the original `n`, `k` is the integer value of the original `k`, `pb` is the integer value of the original `pb`, `ps` is the integer value of the original `ps`, `p` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes two empty lists `pathb` and `paths`. The values of `num_iterations`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
