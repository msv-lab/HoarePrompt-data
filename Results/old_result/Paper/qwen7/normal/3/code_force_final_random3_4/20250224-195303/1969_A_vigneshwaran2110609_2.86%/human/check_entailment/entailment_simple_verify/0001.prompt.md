You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of friends.
   - It then enters a loop where it reads another integer `x` (which should be `n`), but this is not used in the logic.
   - It reads a list of integers `l` representing the best friends for each friend.

2. **Logic:**
   - The program iterates over the list `l`.
   - For each element `l[i]`, it checks if `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1`. This condition is checking if the best friend of the best friend of the current friend is the current friend itself.
   - If this condition is true, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop, assuming only two friends need to be invited.
   - If the condition is false for all elements, it prints `3`.

3. **Problem Statement Requirements:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations needed so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend comes to the party if both the friend and their best friend receive an invitation.
   - The logic in the given program does not correctly handle the conditions to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Condition Check:**
   - The condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is checking if the best friend of the best friend is the same as the current friend, which is not relevant to the problem.
   - This condition does not guarantee that at least 2 friends will come to the party.

2. **Handling of Cases:**
   - The program assumes that if any pair of friends (i.e., `l[i]` and `l[l[i] - 1]`) are best friends of each other, then only 2 friends need to be invited.
   - This assumption is not always correct. For example, consider the input `[3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`. The pairs (3, 4) and (5, 2) are not best friends of each other, yet inviting 2 friends (4 and 5) ensures at least 2 friends come.

3. **Output Logic:**
   - The program prints `2` if any pair of friends are best friends of each other, which is not always the minimum number of invitations needed.
   - The program prints `3` if no such pair is found, which might not be the correct minimum number of invitations.

### Correct Solution:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to find cycles in the best friend relationships and ensure that at least one cycle of length 2 or more exists. We can use graph theory to model this problem and find the minimum number of invitations needed.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not handle the conditions properly to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
