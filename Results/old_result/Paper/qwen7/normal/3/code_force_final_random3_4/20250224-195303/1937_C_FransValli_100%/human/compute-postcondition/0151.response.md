Based on the initial state provided:

- `arr` must have at least 4 elements.
- The fourth element of `arr` is `item`.
- `res` is an input string.
- If `res` is '>', then `mini` is set to `item`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Since `res` is an input string, it could be any string. However, the only relevant condition is if `res` is '>', then `mini` is set to `item`.
2. Given that `arr` must have at least 4 elements and the fourth element is `item`, `item` is a valid value.
3. If `res` is '>', then `mini` will be set to `item`. Otherwise, `mini` will not be assigned a value and will likely be `None` or an undefined value, but since the question does not specify otherwise, we assume `mini` is `item` if `res` is '>', and `None` otherwise.

Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `res`. If `res` is '>', then `mini` will be `item`, and the print statement will output:
- `'?'`
- `item`
- `item`
- `item`
- `item`

If `res` is not '>', then `mini` will be `None`, and the print statement will output:
- `'?'`
- `None`
- `None`
- `item`
- `item`

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `res`, we consider both scenarios. However, the most precise answer based on the given information is:

Output: **'?', [item], [item], [item], [item]** (where `[item]` is the fourth element of `arr` and `[mini]` is `item` if `res` is '>' and `None` otherwise)
