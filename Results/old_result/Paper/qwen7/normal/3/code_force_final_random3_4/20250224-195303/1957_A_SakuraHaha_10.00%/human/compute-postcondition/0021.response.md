Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is the sum of the floor division of each value in `cnt` by 4.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a` is an empty list.
- `cnt` contains the count of each unique element from the original list `a`, where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of how many times it appeared in `a`.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the floor division of each value in `cnt` by 4.

Since the exact values in `cnt` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe it in terms of the values in `cnt`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the floor division of each value in cnt by 4)**
