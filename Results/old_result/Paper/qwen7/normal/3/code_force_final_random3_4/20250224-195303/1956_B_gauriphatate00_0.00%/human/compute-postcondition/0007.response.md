Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is unchanged, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[idx])` takes the element at index `idx` from the list `data`, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variables `data` and `idx` remain unchanged.
