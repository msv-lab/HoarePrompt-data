Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `ans` is the product of `ans` and the first element of `arr`.**

Explanation: The code multiplies `ans` by the first element of the list `arr`, which is stored in the variable `i`. Since `i` is the first element of `arr`, `ans` is updated to be the product of its original value and `i`. All other variables remain in their initial state.
