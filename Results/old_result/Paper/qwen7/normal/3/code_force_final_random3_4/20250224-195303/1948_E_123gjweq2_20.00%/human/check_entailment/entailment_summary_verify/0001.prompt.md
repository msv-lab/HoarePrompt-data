You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

- Program:
from math import ceil
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

#Function 2:
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + i] = small_element + i
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `make_array` accepts two integers `left` and `right` (with `left` less than `right`) and an integer `clique` representing a clique identifier. It fills the array `arr` with a specific pattern of values between indices `left` and `right`, inclusive, and sets corresponding elements in the array `cliquess` to the given `clique` identifier. Specifically, it first populates the array segment from `left` to `left + mid - 1` with increasing values starting from `small_element`, and then populates the segment from `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` with decreasing values starting from `big_element`. After executing the function, the array `arr` and the array `cliquess` will reflect these changes, and the variables `left`, `right`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` will retain their original values.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to handle the main logic of the problem.
   - It calculates the number of cliques (`cliques`) using `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two arrays: `arr` and `cliquess`, both of size `n`.

2. **Loop through `cliques`**:
   - The loop runs from `0` to `cliques - 1`.
   - For each iteration, it calls the `make_array` function to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays.

3. **Function `make_array`**:
   - This function takes `left`, `right`, and `clique` as parameters.
   - It calculates `small_element` and `big_element` based on the indices `left` and `right`.
   - It splits the range `[left, right]` into two parts: `mid` and `not_mid`.
   - It fills the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays with values based on the calculated `small_element` and `big_element`.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `cliques`**:
   - The calculation `cliques = ceil(n / k)` is correct, but it doesn't ensure that all vertices are assigned unique integers from `1` to `n`.

2. **Incorrect Array Filling**:
   - The `make_array` function does not correctly ensure that all integers from `1` to `n` are used uniquely.
   - The current implementation might lead to duplicate values or missing values in the `arr` array.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle cases where `k` is very large compared to `n`, leading to potential issues in the assignment of unique integers.

### Example Test Case Analysis:

Let's consider the example test case `n = 5` and `k = 4`:

- Expected output:
  ```
  3 1 5 2 4
  2
  1 1 2 1 2
  ```

- Actual output from the given code:
  - The `arr` array will be filled with values that do not necessarily cover all integers from `1` to `5` uniquely.
  - The `cliquess` array will be filled with values indicating the cliques, but it might not match the expected partition.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It fails to ensure that all integers from `1` to `n` are used uniquely and does not correctly partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.

Correctness: **False**
