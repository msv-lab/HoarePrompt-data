Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n`.
   - `n` is not explicitly given its value, but we know from the problem statement that `mak` is either `n-1` or any value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute if `n` is at least 1. This is because the `range(n)` function generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is set to `n` at the start, the loop will only execute if `n` is at least 1.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is either `n-1` or any value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 1, `pans` is an empty list**.
