Output State: **`nodes[key]' is a list, and `ends' is a list with an additional element `key`.**

Explanation: The code appends the `key` to the `ends` list. Since the initial condition states that `ends` has an additional element `key` if the length of `nodes[key]` is exactly one, appending `key` to `ends` maintains this condition. Therefore, `nodes[key]` remains a list, and `ends` now contains an additional element `key`.
