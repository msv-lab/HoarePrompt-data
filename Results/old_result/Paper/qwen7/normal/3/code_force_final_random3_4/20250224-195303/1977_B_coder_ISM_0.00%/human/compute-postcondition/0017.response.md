Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `range(30)`. Therefore, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

2. **Determine the New Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. Since the loop iterates over `range(30)`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 30. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

3. **Calculate the New Value of `i`**: If `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, then incrementing `i` by 1 will make it 2.

4. **Check Other Variables**: The other variables `length` and `s` are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop condition. Therefore, they remain unchanged.

5. **Formulate the New State**: Based on the above steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `length` is 30, and `s` is either ['1'] if the bitwise AND of `x` and \(2^1\) is greater than 0, or ['0'] otherwise.**
