Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n_cases)` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `n_cases`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n_cases`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 5.
   - `i` is either 2 or 5.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `power` is an integer.
   - If `n` equals 1, then `power` remains 4.
   - Otherwise, `power` is 4 if it does not equal `n`, and remains 5 if it does equal `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is either 2 or 5, and the loop continues as long as `i < n_cases`, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `n_cases` remains unchanged.

Given that `i` is either 2 or 5, let's consider both cases:
- If `i` was 2, then the next value of `i` will be 3.
- If `i` was 5, then the next value of `i` will be 6.

Since `n_cases` must be greater than 5, and the loop will continue as long as `i < n_cases`, the value of `n_cases` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` must be greater than 5, `i` is either 3 or 6, `n` is an input integer, `power` is an integer, and `n` must be greater than 8 if `i` is 6. If `n` equals 1, then `power` remains 4. Otherwise, `power` is 4 if it does not equal `n`, and remains 5 if it does equal `n`.**
