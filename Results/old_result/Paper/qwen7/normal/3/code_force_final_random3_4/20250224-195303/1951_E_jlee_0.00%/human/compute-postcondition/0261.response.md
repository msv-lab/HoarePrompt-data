Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, `count` is greater than 0, and the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. Additionally, either `count2` is 0 or `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
