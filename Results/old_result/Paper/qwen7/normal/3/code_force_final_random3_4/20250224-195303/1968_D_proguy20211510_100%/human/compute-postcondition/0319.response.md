Output: **Bodya**

Explanation:
- The variable `i` is equal to the total number of elements in the `paths` list.
- `curr` is calculated as `pres` plus the last element of `paths` multiplied by the difference between `k` and the index of the last element.
- `pres` is the sum of all elements in the `paths` list.
- `ress` is the maximum value calculated from `ress` and `curr` during each iteration.
- `resb` is greater than `ress`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Bodya'`, and does not depend on any of the other variables described. Therefore, the output is the string `'Bodya'`.
