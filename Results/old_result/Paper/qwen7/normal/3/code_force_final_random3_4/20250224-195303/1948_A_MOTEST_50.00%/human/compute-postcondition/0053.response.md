Output State: **`i` is 1 more than its previous value, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is now 4 + 2 * s[x], `x` is 2, `j` is `n // 2 + 1`**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` updates the value of `ans` by adding twice the value of `s[x]` to it. Given that `x` is 2, `ans` is updated to `4 + 2 * s[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
