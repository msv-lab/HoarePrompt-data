Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` is the length of the list `S`; `left` is `S[0][0]`; `lsum` is `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`; `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n - lsum` to `rsum`. Given that `lsum` is `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`, `rsum` becomes `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`. The other variables (`i`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
