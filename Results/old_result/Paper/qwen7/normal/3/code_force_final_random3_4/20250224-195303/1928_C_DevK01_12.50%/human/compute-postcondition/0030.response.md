Output State: **`i` is 3, `w` is the integer part of the square root of `q` and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `q` is divisible by `i`, `M` is a list containing the elements 1, `q // i`, `i`, and `i`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `M`. Initially, `M` contains the elements 1, `q // i`, and `i` with `q // i` greater than or equal to `x - 1`. After appending `i`, `M` now contains 1, `q // i`, `i`, and `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
