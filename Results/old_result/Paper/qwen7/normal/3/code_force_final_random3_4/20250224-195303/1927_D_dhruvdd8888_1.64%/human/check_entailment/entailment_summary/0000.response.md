Reasoning:
1. The program correctly processes the input by constructing segments of consecutive identical elements.
2. It uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to efficiently find the relevant segment for each query.
3. The logic for determining the indices `i` and `j` within the queried range `[l, r)` is correct:
   - If the start of the segment is greater than `l`, it prints the previous index and the current index.
   - If the end of the segment is less than `r`, it prints the start and end of the segment.
   - If no suitable segment is found, it prints `-1 -1`.
4. The program handles multiple test cases and queries as required, printing the results directly without returning any value.

Given the execution summary and the provided code, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
