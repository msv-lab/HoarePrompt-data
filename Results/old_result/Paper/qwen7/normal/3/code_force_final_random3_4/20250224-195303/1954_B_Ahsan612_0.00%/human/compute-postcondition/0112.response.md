Postcondition: `minn` is the minimum value between infinity and 1, `same` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `ar[i]` equals `num`, `num` is either `ar[0]` or `ar[i]` based on the condition, `ar` is updated with integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `i` is either 1 or 3, and `same` is set to 1 in the else part.
