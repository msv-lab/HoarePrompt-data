Postcondition: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, `res` is incremented by 1 if the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, and `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, `res` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.
