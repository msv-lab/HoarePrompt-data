Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the input `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Typically, the loop starts with `i` set to 0.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state of `t`, `n`, and `p`**: Since the loop itself does not directly use `t` or `p`, these values do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, they should still be consistent with their given constraints.

Given this analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. Specifically, `i` should be set to 0, and `n` should be within its valid range (2 ≤ n ≤ 50).

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 50 inclusive**.
