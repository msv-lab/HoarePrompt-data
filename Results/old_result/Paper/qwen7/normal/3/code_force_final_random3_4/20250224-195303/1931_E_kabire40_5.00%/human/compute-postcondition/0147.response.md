Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least three elements, `rev_val` is a sorted list of the reversed integers of the reversed strings in `operational_list` whose reverse does not have the same length as the original string, `rev_res` is the sum of all integers in `rev_val` plus the integer value of the last element of `operational_list` if its reverse has the same length as the original string, otherwise it includes the reversed integer of the last element, `y` remains 1, `x` is `x + 1`, `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[x]`**.

In natural language: The operational list and rev_val remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable rev_res, y, and x follow their initial conditions. The variable val_in is now set to the integer value of the element at index x in the rev_val list, which is `x + 1`.
