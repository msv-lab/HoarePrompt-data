Output State: **`same` is 1, `minn` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is `ar[3]`, `i` is 3, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value (`same`, which is 1) and the value of `same`. Since both values are 1, `minn` remains 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
