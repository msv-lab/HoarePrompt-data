Output State: `vis` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `pb - 1` set to 1, `i` is equal to the length of `paths`, `k` is equal to the length of `paths`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the loop iterations, `ress` holds the final maximum value between all `curr` values, `pathb` contains all elements added until `vis[pb - 1] == 1`, `paths` contains all elements added during the loop iterations, `n` is an integer from the first input string, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]` until the loop breaks, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the first input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `vis[ps - 1]` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

In this final state, the loop has executed until `vis[ps - 1]` becomes 1, meaning that every element in `vis` has been set to 1 at least once during the loop iterations. The `paths` list will contain all the elements added from `a` based on the values of `ps` until the loop breaks. The `ps` variable will hold the value it had when the loop broke, which is `p[ps - 1]` at the last iteration. All other variables remain unchanged as they were not modified within the loop body.
