Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are no two different elements within the queried range. Specifically, if all elements in the queried range are the same, the program will incorrectly print a valid pair of indices instead of `-1 -1`.

Consider the following example:

- Input:
```
5
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

- Expected Output:
```
2 3
-1 -1
-1 -1
```

However, the program's output will be:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

This happens because the program always tries to find a pair of different elements and prints the first valid pair it finds, even if it is not the correct answer for the given query. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
