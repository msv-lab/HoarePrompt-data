Output State: All elements in the list `nums` are set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`; `i` is equal to `n`; `k` is reduced to 0 or a value less than `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `k` is greater than or equal to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. In each iteration, `nums[i]` is assigned the value `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and then `k` is decreased by this value. This process repeats until `k` is less than `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. At this point, the loop terminates, and all elements in `nums` will be set to the same value, which is the largest number that can be represented with the bit length of `k`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, and `k` will be the remaining value after all possible assignments to `nums[i]`.
