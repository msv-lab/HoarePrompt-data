Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple `(v1, v2)` in the reversed list `ops[::-1]`.

2. **Understand the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple.
   - The last element of the first tuple in `ops` has been modified based on a condition.
   - `v1` is the first element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`.
   - `v2` is the second element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`.

3. **Determine the new values for `v1` and `v2` for the next iteration**:
   - Since we are iterating over `ops[::-1]`, the next tuple in the reversed list will be the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.
   - `v1` will be the first element of this next tuple.
   - `v2` will be the second element of this next tuple.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - The list `ops` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `v1` and `v2` will now refer to the first and second elements of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ops` is a list containing at least one tuple where the last element of the first tuple is updated based on the condition; `v1` is the first element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]; `v2` is the second element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`**.
