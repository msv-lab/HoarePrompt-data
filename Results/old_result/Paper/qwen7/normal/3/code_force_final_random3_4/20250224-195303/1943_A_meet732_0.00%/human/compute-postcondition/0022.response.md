Output State: **`c` is decreased by 1, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `cntl[j]` is less than 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement we were inside. The values of the variables `c`, `j`, `n`, and `cntl[j]` remain unchanged, and the condition `j` being equal to `n` or `cntl[j]` being less than 2 still holds true.
