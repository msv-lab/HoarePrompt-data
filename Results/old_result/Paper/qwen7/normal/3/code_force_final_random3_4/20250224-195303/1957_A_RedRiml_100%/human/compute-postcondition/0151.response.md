Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in pl`. The only variable involved here is `j`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `shapes` is 0 + `d[1]` // 3 if `d[1]` is greater than or equal to 3. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.
   - `j` is 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `pl` to iterate over. Since `j` is being incremented in each iteration, we need to determine the value of `j` for the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and is incremented in each iteration, for the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - Therefore, if `j` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 2 for the next iteration.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The value of `shapes` does not change based on the loop itself but rather on the value of `d[1]`. Since `d[1]` is not modified within the loop, its value remains the same.
   - Thus, `shapes` will remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

**State: **`shapes` is 0 + `d[1]` // 3 and `j` is 2**.
