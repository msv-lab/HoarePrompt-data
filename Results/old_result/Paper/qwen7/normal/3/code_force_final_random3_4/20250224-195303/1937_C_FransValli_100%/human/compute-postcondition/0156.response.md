Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `arr` must have at least `len(arr)` elements, with each element of `arr` being checked exactly once starting from the second element. The variable `mini` will hold the minimum value among all elements of `arr` that was updated whenever `res` was '>' during the loop iterations. The variable `i` remains unchanged as it was initialized to `n` (which is not further modified within the loop) and `maxi` remains 0 throughout the loop.

In simpler terms, `mini` will be the smallest value found in the array `arr` after comparing each element with the current `mini` and updating it when necessary based on user input. The other variables (`i` and `maxi`) will retain their initial values.
