Output State: **`idx` is 1, `t` is an integer from the list `data`, and `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t` to be the integer at the current index `idx` in the list `data`. Since `idx` was initially 0, after executing `t = int(data[idx])`, `idx` is incremented to 1 (as list indexing starts from 0), and `t` is set to the integer value of the first element in `data`. The state of `data` remains unchanged.
