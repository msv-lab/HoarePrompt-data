Output State: **`q[j]` is greater than 0; `eta` contains the index `j + 1` and now also contains `j`; `q` is a list of integers, and `j + 1` is an index within the range of the list `q`.**

Explanation: The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Since `eta` initially contained the index `j + 1`, after appending `j`, `eta` now contains both `j + 1` and `j`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
