Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not handle cases where the strip has multiple segments of black cells. For example, consider the input:

```
6
BWBWWB
```

The correct answer should be 3 (painting the segment from the 2nd to the 4th cell), but the program incorrectly calculates the result as 4. This is because the program only considers the first and last black cells without checking the entire strip for the shortest segment that needs to be painted.
