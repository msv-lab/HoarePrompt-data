Postcondition: `h1` is a string representing the hour part of a time, `m1` is the string converted from the second input split by `:`, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'. If `h` is '19', then `h1` is '07', `m1` is the string converted from the second input split by `:`, and `time` is 'PM'. Otherwise, `h1` is one of '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', or '20', `m1` is the string converted from the second input split by `:`, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.
