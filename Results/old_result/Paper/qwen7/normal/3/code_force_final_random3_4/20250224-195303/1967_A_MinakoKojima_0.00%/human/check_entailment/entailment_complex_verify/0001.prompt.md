You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and the final state of the variables is as follows: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is the last integer input for the nth iteration; `k` is the last integer input for the kth iteration; `a` is a list of integers representing the last input list for the nth iteration; `m` is the minimum value of the list `a`; `ans` is the final calculated answer based on the conditions inside the loop. If `k` was greater than or equal to `n * m` throughout all iterations, `ans` will be the factorial of `n`. Otherwise, `ans` will be the cumulative product of differences between consecutive elements of the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n and k, and a list a of n integers. It calculates and prints a value based on the input parameters. Specifically, it determines the minimum value in the list a and adjusts the values in a according to certain conditions involving k. Finally, it computes and outputs a result derived from the adjusted list a.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads the list `a` of size `n`.

2. **Initial Calculation:**
   - `m = min(a)`: This calculates the minimum value in the list `a`.
   - `ans = 0`: Initializes the answer variable.
   - If `k >= n * m`, it calculates the factorial of `n` and assigns it to `ans`. This is because if we can afford to buy enough cards to make every position have at least `m` cards, we can rearrange them to form permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

3. **Adjustment with Remaining Coins:**
   - If `k < n * m`, it adjusts the values in `a` using the remaining coins `k`.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and updates each element based on the formula `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
   - It then subtracts the used coins from `k`.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - After adjusting the values, it calculates the product of differences between consecutive elements in the adjusted list `a` and assigns it to `ans`.

### Verification Against Test Cases:

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
- Input: 
  ```
  1
  1 10
  1
  ```
- Expected Output: `11`
- Explanation: Since `n=1` and `k=10`, we can buy up to 10 more cards of type 1. The initial list is `[1]`, and after buying 10 more cards, the list becomes `[11]`. The score is calculated as the number of subarrays of length 1 that are permutations of `[1]`, which is 11.

#### Example 2:
- Input:
  ```
  2
  2 4
  8 4
  3 9
  7 6 2
  ```
- Expected Outputs: `15` and `28`
- Explanation:
  - For the first test case, we can buy 4 cards of type 2 and rearrange the cards to `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`. This gives us 8 subarrays of `[1, 2]` and 7 subarrays of `[2, 1]`, totaling 15 subarrays.
  - For the second test case, we can buy 9 cards of type 2 and rearrange the cards to `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`. This gives us 8 subarrays of `[1, 2]` and 7 subarrays of `[2, 1]`, totaling 28 subarrays.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum score by adjusting the counts of cards and calculating the product of differences. It handles both scenarios where we can afford to buy enough cards to make every position have at least `m` cards and where we need to adjust the counts with the remaining coins.
