Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `v` and the range specified by `na_frente, -1, -1`.

2. **Determine the initial value and condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop starts with `v` set to `na_frente` and decrements `v` until it reaches `-1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to `-1`.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `total` is 0 and does not affect the loop execution.
   - `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to `-1` for the loop to start.
   - `pos_final`, `c`, `best`, `cases`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to `-1`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: `total` is 0, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1**
