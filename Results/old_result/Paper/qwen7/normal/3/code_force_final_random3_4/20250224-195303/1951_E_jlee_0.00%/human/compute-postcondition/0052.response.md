Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is 2, `done` is True, the current value of `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `j`, `n`, `done`, and the condition of `s[0]` and `s[1]` remain unchanged.
