Output State: The function `func_1()` has been called three times, and the loop will continue to call `func_1()` as long as a positive integer is input from the user.

Explanation: Given that the loop continues to execute based on the input from the user and `func_1()` is called each time the loop runs, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished would be that `func_1()` has been called multiple times (at least 3 times as per the provided information), and it will keep being called as long as the user inputs a positive integer.
