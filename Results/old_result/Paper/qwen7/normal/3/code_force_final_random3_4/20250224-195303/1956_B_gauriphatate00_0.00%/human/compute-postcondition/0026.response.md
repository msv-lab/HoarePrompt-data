Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- After the loop finishes, `t` is 0 because all iterations are done.
- `idx` is `idx + n` from the last iteration, where `n` is `int(data[idx])`.
- `a` is a list of integers created by mapping `int` over the slice of `data` from `idx` to `idx + n`.
- `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration, with a total of `t` elements.
- `data` remains unchanged throughout the process.

### Loop Head:
The loop head is:
```python
for result in results:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `result`: This variable is used to iterate over the elements in the `results` list.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `results` list.
   - Since `t` is 0 after the loop finishes, this implies that the loop has iterated through all the elements in `results`.

3. **State Adjustments:**
   - We need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the initial state and the conditions derived from the given information.
   - The key variables to consider are `results` and potentially `idx` and `data`, but since the loop head does not directly use `idx` or `data`, we focus on `results`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute, `results` must contain at least one element. Since `t` is 0 after the loop, it means the loop has iterated through all elements in `results`, implying that `results` must have had at least one element before the loop started.

### Final State:
State: **`results` is a non-empty list (since t is 0 after the loop, it means results must have had at least one element)**

So, the final state adjustment needed for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`results` is a non-empty list**
