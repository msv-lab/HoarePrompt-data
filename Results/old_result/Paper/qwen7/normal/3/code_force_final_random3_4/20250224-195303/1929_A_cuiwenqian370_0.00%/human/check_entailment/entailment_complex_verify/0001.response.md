### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
   - The beauty is maximized by arranging the array in such a way that the positive differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array elements.
   - It calls `func_1(n, arr)` to compute the maximum beauty.
   - `func_1` sorts the array and then alternately appends the smallest and largest remaining elements to `new_arr`. This approach aims to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Checking the Logic in `func_1`**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest and largest elements are considered first.
   - By alternating between the smallest and largest elements, the function tries to create the largest possible differences between consecutive elements.
   - The loop calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

4. **Validation**:
   - The logic in `func_1` seems to follow the strategy of maximizing differences by alternating between the smallest and largest elements.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the approach. When sorting the array and then alternating between the smallest and largest elements, the resulting array may not always yield the maximum possible beauty. Consider the following example:
     - Input: `[10, 20, 30]`
     - Sorted array: `[10, 20, 30]`
     - New array: `[10, 30, 20]`
     - Beauty: `(30 - 10) + (20 - 30) = 20 - 10 = 10`
     - Optimal arrangement: `[30, 10, 20]`
     - Optimal beauty: `(30 - 10) + (20 - 30) = 20 + (-10) = 10`

   - In this example, the optimal arrangement `[30, 10, 20]` yields a higher beauty than the one generated by the current approach.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not guarantee the maximum beauty because it only considers the alternating approach without exploring all possible permutations of the array.
   - A more effective approach would involve generating all possible permutations and calculating the beauty for each permutation to find the maximum.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not guarantee the maximum beauty of the array. The approach of sorting and then alternating between the smallest and largest elements does not always yield the optimal result.
