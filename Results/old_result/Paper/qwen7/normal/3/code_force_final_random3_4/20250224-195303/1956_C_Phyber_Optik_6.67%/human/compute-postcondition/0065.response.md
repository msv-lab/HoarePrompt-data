Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is 2, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The code updates the `sum` variable by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n * (n + 1) // 2` calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. The values of `i` and `r` remain unchanged.
