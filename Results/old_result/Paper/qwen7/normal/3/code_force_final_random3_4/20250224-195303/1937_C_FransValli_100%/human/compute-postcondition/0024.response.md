Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`.
   - This means `i` will take values from 1 to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: According to the provided state, `i` is initially set to `n-1`.

3. **Understand the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute with the current state**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `n` when the loop starts.
   - Given that `i` is initially `n-1`, the loop will not execute because `i` is already equal to `n-1`, and the loop condition is `i < n`.

5. **Adjust the state to allow the loop to execute**:
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, `i` should be set to a value less than `n`.

6. **Consider other variables**:
   - `arr`: It is a list containing 0, but this does not affect the loop condition directly.
   - `maxi`: Its value (3) does not affect the loop condition either.
   - `res`: It is an input string, but again, its value does not affect the loop condition.

Based on the above analysis, the only variable that needs adjustment is `i` to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is less than `n`, `arr` is a list containing 0, `maxi` is 3, `res` is an input string**.

Note: Since `i` is initially set to `n-1`, we need to adjust it to a value less than `n` to ensure the loop executes.
