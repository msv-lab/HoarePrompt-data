Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `d` is a dictionary.
- `pl` is a list.
- `pl` contains the next element of `i`.
- If `i` was not in `d`, it is now added with a value of 1, otherwise its value is incremented by 1.

### Loop Head
The loop head is defined as follows:
```python
for i in palka:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `i` is taken from the iterable `palka`.
- The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, we know that each iteration updates the dictionary `d` and the list `pl`.

### Adjusting the States
- Since the loop variable `i` comes from `palka`, the value of `i` itself does not change within the loop.
- The dictionary `d` and the list `pl` are updated based on the value of `i`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in `palka`.

### Updated State
- `d` remains a dictionary.
- `pl` contains the next element of `i`.
- If `i` was not in `d`, it is now added with a value of 1, otherwise its value is incremented by 1.
- `i` is the next element in `palka`.

### Final State
State: **`d` is a dictionary, `pl` contains the next element of `i`, if `i` was not in `d`, it is now added with a value of 1, otherwise its value is incremented by 1, and `i` is the next element in `palka`**.
