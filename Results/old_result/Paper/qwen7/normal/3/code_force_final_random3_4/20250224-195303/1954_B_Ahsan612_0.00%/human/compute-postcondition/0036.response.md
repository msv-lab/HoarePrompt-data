Output State: **`same` is either 3 or 4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer; `minn` is the minimum value found in the list `ar`; `i` is incremented by 1 and remains less than `len(ar) - 1`; if `ar[i] == num`, then `same` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, and `num` is the value of `ar[i]`**.

In natural language: The variable `i` has been incremented by 1 and still remains less than `len(ar) - 1`. All other variables retain their previous conditions and values. If `ar[i]` equals `num`, `same` remains either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `same` becomes 1, `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and 1, and `num` is set to the value of `ar[i]`.
