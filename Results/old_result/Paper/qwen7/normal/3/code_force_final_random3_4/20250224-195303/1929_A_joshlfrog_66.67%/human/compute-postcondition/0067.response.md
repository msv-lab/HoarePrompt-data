Output State: **`i` is `l-1`, `x` is the maximum value found in the list `nums`, `y` is 100000000, `e` is `t`, `l` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers created from user input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and splits it into a list of integers using a list comprehension. This list is assigned to the variable `nums`. The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, `e`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new list `nums` is created based on the user's input.
