Based on the initial state provided:

- `h1` is one of the strings from the set: '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '09', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18'.
- `m1` is equal to `m`.
- `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.
- `h` is the input hour.

The print statement is:
```python
print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `h1` is a string representing part of the hour in a 12-hour format.
2. `m` is a string representing the minutes.
3. `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.
4. `sep=''` means no separator between the arguments, so they will be concatenated directly.

Given these details, the output will be a string where `h1` is followed by a colon, then the minutes `m`, a space, and finally the `time`.

Output: **h1 : m time**
