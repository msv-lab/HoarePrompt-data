Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

# Annotated Program:
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000 for each x in test_cases.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        
        best_y = 1
        
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        
        results.append(best_y)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing the `best_y` value for each `x` in `test_cases` after the loop has executed all iterations. The loop processes each `x` in `test_cases` exactly once, finding the `y` that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` plus `y` (i.e., `gcd_val + y`). For each `x`, the corresponding `best_y` is appended to `results`. After all iterations, `results` will contain one element for each `x` in `test_cases`, representing the optimal `y` for each `x`.
    #
    #The other variables retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop: `max_sum` holds the highest `current_sum` found across all iterations, `x` holds the last `x` value processed, `y` holds the last `y` value processed, `gcd_val` holds the last calculated greatest common divisor, and `current_sum` holds the last calculated sum. However, these values are not included in the `results` list but are relevant for understanding the state of the loop's execution.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing the best `y` value for each `x` in `test_cases` after processing all iterations of the loop. Each `best_y` corresponds to the `y` that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` plus `y` (i.e., `gcd_val + y`) for its respective `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of positive integers between 2 and 1000. For each `x` in `test_cases`, it finds the best `y` that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` plus `y` (i.e., `gcd_val + y`). It returns a list `results` containing the best `y` value for each `x` in `test_cases`.
