Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. For each test case, it takes two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, and performs some unspecified operation or returns some unspecified value based on x and y.**

Note: The specific operation or return value is not provided in the given information, so the functionality description focuses on the input constraints and the fact that the function processes multiple test cases.
