### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input and parses them into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the necessary values (n, x, y, and the array). This matches the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates through each test case and initializes a `residue_map` to keep track of the residues of each element modulo x and y.
   - For each element in the array, it calculates the required residues `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.
   - It then checks if there are any previous elements with matching residues using `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, and increments the count accordingly.
   - The logic for calculating residues and checking conditions is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Residue Calculation:**
   - The calculation of `r_x = -num % x` is correct because it ensures that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by x. Specifically, if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by x, then `a_i % x + a_j % x` must also be divisible by x. Using `-num % x` achieves this by ensuring that the result is in the range `[0, x-1]`.

4. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - The program correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs by checking if the residues match those of previously seen elements. This ensures that both conditions `a_i + a_j` is divisible by x and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by y are satisfied.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the results for each test case as specified, which is correct.

Given the above points, the program appears to implement the solution correctly based on the problem description. The original assessment is accurate.
