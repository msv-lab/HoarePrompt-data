The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string, `n` is 1, `done` is False, and either the current value of `n` is odd and the middle element of `s` is not equal to `x`, or `x` is equal to the last element of `s`. Additionally, `s.count(x)` is equal to `n - 1`.**
