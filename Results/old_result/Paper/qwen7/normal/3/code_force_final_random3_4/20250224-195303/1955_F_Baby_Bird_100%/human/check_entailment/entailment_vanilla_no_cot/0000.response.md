Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The formula used in the program does not accurately determine the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the optimal removal of numbers by Eve.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the parity (odd or even) of the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s, and how removing numbers affects the overall bitwise XOR result. Specifically, we need to ensure that the final XOR result is zero for Bob to win. The current implementation does not reflect this logic.
