Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `answer` has an element appended which is `array[a[0]]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `array[a[0]]` to the list `answer`. However, the values of `i`, `n`, and the initial state of `answer` (which was not specified but implied to be empty) are not directly altered by this line of code. The value of `i` remains 2, and `n` remains greater than or equal to 2. The list `answer` gains a new element, which is `array[a[0]]`.
