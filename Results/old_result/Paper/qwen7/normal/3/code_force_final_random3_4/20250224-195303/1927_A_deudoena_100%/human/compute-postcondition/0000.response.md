Output State: **`ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character in `s` is 'B'**.

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `ma` and `mi` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state.
