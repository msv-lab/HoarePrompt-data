Output: **No**

Explanation: According to the initial state, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is explicitly defined as 1, `a` and `b` are integers from the input, and if both `a` and `b` are odd, they remain unchanged. The print statement simply outputs the string 'No', regardless of the values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the output will be 'No'.
