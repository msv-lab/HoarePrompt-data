Output: **2 ** n**

Explanation: 
- `power` is equal to `n`.
- `n` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 128.
- Therefore, `2 ** power` translates to `2 ** n`.

Given these conditions, the print statement will output \(2\) raised to the power of `n`, where `n` is the user-inputted integer greater than 128.
