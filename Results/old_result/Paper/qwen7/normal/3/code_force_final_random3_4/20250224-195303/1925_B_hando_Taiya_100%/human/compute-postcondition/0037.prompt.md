You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func_1():
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `ans` will be the largest integer \( d \) such that \( d \) is a divisor of \( x \) and either \( d \) or \( x / d \) is less than or equal to \( n \).
    #
    #This output state is derived from the loop's behavior. The loop iterates over all integers from 1 to \( \lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor \), checking if they are divisors of \( x \). For each divisor \( i \), it updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and either \( i \) or \( x // i \), provided that \( n \leq x // i \) or \( n \leq i \). After all iterations, `ans` will hold the largest divisor \( d \) of \( x \) that meets the specified condition.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x such that either d or x/d is less than or equal to n)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where for each test case, it accepts three integers: t (such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), x (such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8), and n (such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x). It processes these inputs and returns different outputs based on the values of t, x, and n.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
