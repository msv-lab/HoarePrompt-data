Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 2, `output1` is a list containing the value 1, `output2` is a list containing the value `int(x / i)`**.

Explanation: The code appends the integer division of `x` by `i` (which is 2) to `output2`. Since `x` is an integer and `i` is 2, `int(x / i)` calculates the integer division of `x` by 2 and adds this value to `output2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
