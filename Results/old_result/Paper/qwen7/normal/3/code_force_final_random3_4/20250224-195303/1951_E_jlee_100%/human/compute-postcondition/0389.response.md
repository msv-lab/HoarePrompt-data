Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `n-1`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the current value of `s[n - 1 - j]`

The print statement is `print(string)`, but since no specific string is defined in the initial state, we need to infer what `string` might refer to. Given the context, it seems like `string` could be the string `s` itself, considering the indices and conditions mentioned.

Since `j` is `n-1`, and the condition states that `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, this implies that `s[n-1]` is not equal to `s[0]` (because `n - 1 - (n-1) = 0`).

However, without the actual content of `s`, we cannot provide a precise value for the string. But we can describe the state of the string based on the given conditions.

Output: **s (where s is a string such that s[n-1] != s[0])**
