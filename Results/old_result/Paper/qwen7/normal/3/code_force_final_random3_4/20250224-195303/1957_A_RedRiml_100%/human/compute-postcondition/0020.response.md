Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in palka`. The variables involved here are `i` and `palka`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition states that if `i` is not in `pl`, then `d.get(i)` is set to `1`. If `i` is in `pl`, then `d[i]` is incremented by `1`.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - **Variable `i`**: Since the loop iterates over each element in `palka`, `i` will take on the value of the next element in `palka` in the next iteration.
   - **Variable `palka`**: The length of `palka` does not change within the loop, but its contents might change if elements are added or removed (though no such operations are mentioned). Therefore, we assume `palka` remains the same unless explicitly stated otherwise.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `palka` must still contain at least one element because the loop continues as long as there are elements left to iterate over.
   - `i` will be the next element in `palka`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next element in `palka` being processed.

**Answer**:
State: **`palka` must contain at least one element, and `i` is the next element in `palka`**.
