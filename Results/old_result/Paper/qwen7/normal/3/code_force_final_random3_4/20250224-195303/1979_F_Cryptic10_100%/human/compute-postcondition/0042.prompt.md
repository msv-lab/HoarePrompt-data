Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, `ops` is a list containing up to `n-2` tuples, `p1` is the first element of the set `vx`, and `p2` is the second element of the set `vx`.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple where the last element of the first tuple is updated based on the condition (if the last element of the first tuple is equal to `v2`, then append `v1` to the first tuple, otherwise the first tuple remains unchanged)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple where the last element of the first tuple is updated based on the condition (if the last element of the first tuple is equal to `v2`, then append `v1` to the first tuple, otherwise the first tuple remains unchanged); `v1` is the first element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`; `v2` is the second element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`. The first tuple in `ops` has been modified according to the condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple where the last element of the first tuple is updated based on the condition; `v1` is the first element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`; `v2` is the second element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`; the first tuple in `ops` has its last element appended with `v1` if the last element of the first tuple equals `v2`, otherwise, the first tuple remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
