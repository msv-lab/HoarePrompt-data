Output State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `input_value` must be greater than `k + 2`, `l` is updated to the value of `int(input())`, `s` is a list of `l` elements, each initialized to 0, `array` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting to integers, `ans` is a string where each character corresponds to `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in the original `array`, with `s[j]` incremented by 1 for each iteration.**

Explanation: The code `array = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `array`. The values of `i`, `input_value`, `l`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged except that `array` is now populated with the integers from the input.
