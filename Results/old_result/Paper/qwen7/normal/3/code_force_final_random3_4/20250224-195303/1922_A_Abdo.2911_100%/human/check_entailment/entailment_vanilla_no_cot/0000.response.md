Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in determining whether a template `t` exists that satisfies the conditions. Specifically, the logic for checking if a template can be constructed is flawed. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for `possible` Flag**: The current logic checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and if `c[i]` is different. However, this does not guarantee that a valid template can be formed. For example, if `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` are all different, it might still be possible to form a valid template.

2. **Template Construction**: The program should check if it's possible to construct a template where both `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. This involves more complex logic than just comparing characters directly.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        
        # Create sets of unique characters in a, b, and c
        a_set = set(a)
        b_set = set(b)
        c_set = set(c)
        
        # Check if a and b have any character that c does not have
        common_chars_ab = a_set & b_set
        invalid_chars_c = c_set - common_chars_ab
        
        # If c has any character that is not in a and b, it's impossible
        if invalid_chars_c:
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Check if there is any character in c that is not in a or b
            if len(common_chars_ab) < n:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')

func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Set Operations**: Convert the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` into sets to easily find common and unique characters.
2. **Common Characters**: Find the common characters between `a` and `b`.
3. **Invalid Characters in `c`**: Check if `c` has any characters that are not in the common set of `a` and `b`. If it does, it's impossible to form a valid template.
4. **Character Availability**: Ensure that the common characters between `a` and `b` cover all positions in `n`.

This approach correctly determines whether a valid template can be constructed based on the given constraints.
