Given the initial state and the code snippet:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `A` is equal to `int(m // a) + 1`.
- `B` is equal to `int(m / b) + 1`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(A + B)
```

Let's break down the values of `A` and `B`:

- `A = int(m // a) + 1`: This means `A` is the integer division of `m` by `a` (which truncates the decimal part), plus 1.
- `B = int(m / b) + 1`: This means `B` is the integer division of `m` by `b` (which also truncates the decimal part), plus 1.

When these values are added together, the expression `A + B` will be evaluated and printed.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of `A` and `B` based on the given formulas.

Output: **int(m // a) + int(m / b) + 2**
