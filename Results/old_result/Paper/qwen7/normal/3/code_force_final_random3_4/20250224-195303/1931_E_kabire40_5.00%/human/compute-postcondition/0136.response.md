Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least three elements, `rev_val` is a sorted list of the reversed integers of the strings in `operational_list` whose reverse does not have the same length as the original string, `rev_res` is the sum of all integers in `rev_val` plus the integer value of the last element of `operational_list` if its reverse has the same length as the original string, otherwise it includes the reversed integer of the last element, and `y` remains 1.**

Explanation: The code `rev_val.sort()` sorts the list `rev_val` in ascending order. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact values in `operational_list` or `rev_val`, the only change is the sorting of `rev_val`. The other variables (`operational_list`, `rev_res`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
