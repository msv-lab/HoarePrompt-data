### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the winner of the game after \( t \) rounds on a tree structure.
   - In each round, a stone is placed on a node, and players take turns moving the stone to an unvisited neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - The game is played optimally by both players.

2. **Analyzing Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function calculates the distances from a given starting node to all other nodes in the tree.
   - It uses a recursive approach to traverse the tree.
   - If the starting node has only one neighbor (excluding the parent), it returns `[0]`.
   - Otherwise, it recursively calculates distances to all other neighbors and returns a list of distances.

3. **Analyzing Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function constructs the tree from the input edges and calculates the distances from the starting node using `func_1`.
   - It identifies leaf nodes (nodes with only one neighbor) and stores them in a deque.
   - It then checks if there is at least one odd-numbered distance in the list of distances returned by `func_1`.
   - If there is at least one odd-numbered distance, it prints "Ron"; otherwise, it prints "Hermione".

4. **Game Strategy:**
   - The game is essentially a combinatorial game theory problem where the parity of the number of moves determines the winner.
   - If there is at least one odd-numbered distance, Ron can force a win by making the first move and ensuring the game ends with an odd number of moves.
   - If all distances are even, Hermione can force a win by ensuring the game ends with an even number of moves.

5. **Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the distances.
   - The implementation of `func_1` correctly calculates the distances from the starting node to all other nodes.
   - The overall structure of the code matches the problem requirements and the optimal strategy.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the parity of the distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
