Output State: **`ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the character whose ASCII value is `s[j] + 97`, and `j` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` updates the variable `ans` by appending the character whose ASCII value is `s[j] + 97` to its current value. Here, `s[j]` is assumed to be an integer representing the ASCII value of a character minus 97. The variable `j` is also incremented by 1 after the operation.
