Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x < k - 1:
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif x == k - 1:
        if a >= x + 3:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        z = 0
        for i in range(x + 1):
            z += z // (k - 1) + 1
        if a >= z:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9; `k`, `x`, and `a` retain their original values. `x` will either remain less than `k - 1` or, if `x` equals `k - 1`, it will remain equal to `k - 1` under certain conditions involving `a`. Additionally, `i` will be equal to `x`, `x` must be a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `z` will be the result of adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x + 1` times. The function will return `a` if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`; otherwise, it will return `z`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is an integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `i` equals `2x + 1` or remains equal to `x`, `z` equals `x + 1` or remains yet to be calculated based on the given conditions, and `a` remains unchanged. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then `i` remains equal to `x` and `z` remains yet to be calculated based on the given conditions. If `x` is not less than `k - 1`, then `i` equals `2x + 1` and `z` equals `x + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `k` is an integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` remains unchanged, `i` equals `2x + 1` if `x >= k - 1`, otherwise `i` equals `x`, `z` equals `3 * (z + z // (k - 1) + 1)` if `x == k - 1`, otherwise `z` equals `x + 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` remains unchanged. If `a` is less than `z`, then `a` is updated to `z`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
