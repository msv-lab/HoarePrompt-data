Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is the `for` loop where `i` ranges from `0` to `len(pathb) - 1`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(pathb)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `k` is less than `i + 1`.
   - The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `curr`.
   - `preb` is `preb + pathb[0]`.
   - `curr` is `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the next value of `i` will be `1`.
   - The condition `k < i + 1` will still hold true because `i` is increasing.
   - The program will not break out of the loop since `i` is still within the range of `len(pathb)`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `1`.
   - `k` will remain less than `i + 1` (which is now `2`).
   - `resb`, `preb`, and `curr` will retain their values unless the loop body modifies them, but no such modification is mentioned in the given information.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` will be 1.
- `k` will be less than `i + 1`, which means `k` must be less than `2`.

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `k` is less than 2**
