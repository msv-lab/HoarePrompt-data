Output State: **`prev` is equal to `curr`, `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the list `ends`, respectively; `tree` is a list containing the elements `s` and `curr`; `curr` is the first element of `nodes[s]` and must not be equal to `e`; `tree` has been appended with `curr`. Additionally, `nodes[curr][0]` is not equal to `prev`.**

Explanation: The line `prev = curr` updates the value of `prev` to be the current value of `curr`. All other conditions and relationships between variables remain unchanged.
