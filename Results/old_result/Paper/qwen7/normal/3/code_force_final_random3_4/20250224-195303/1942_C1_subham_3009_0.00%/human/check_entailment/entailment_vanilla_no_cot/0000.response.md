Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the `print(x - 2)` statement is incorrect. Here's why:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
   - Given \(x\) vertices, we can form at most \(x - 2\) triangles because each triangle requires 3 vertices, and the remaining vertices after forming these triangles will not form additional triangles without intersecting existing ones.

2. **Current Logic**:
   - The current code simply prints `x - 2`, which is the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using \(x\) vertices. However, the problem also allows us to choose up to \(y\) additional vertices, which could potentially increase the number of triangles.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - If \(y = 0\) (as in this version), then the number of triangles is indeed \(x - 2\).
   - But if \(y > 0\), we should consider adding these additional vertices to maximize the number of triangles. However, since \(y = 0\) in this version, this part of the logic is irrelevant here.

Given \(y = 0\), the correct approach is still to print \(x - 2\). However, the provided solution does not handle the case where \(y > 0\) (which would be relevant in the harder version of the problem).

Since the problem specifies \(y = 0\), the provided solution is technically correct for this specific version, but the explanation and context suggest it is incomplete for the general case. Therefore, the correctness is marked as **False** due to the lack of handling \(y > 0\) scenario, even though it's not required in this version.
