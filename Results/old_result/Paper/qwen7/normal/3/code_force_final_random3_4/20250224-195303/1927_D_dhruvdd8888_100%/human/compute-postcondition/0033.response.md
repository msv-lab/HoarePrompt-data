Output State: **`input_value` must be a positive integer, `l` is the first integer from input split by space and converted to int, `r` is the second integer from input split by space and converted to int, `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`.**

The code `eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))` finds the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the list `arr`. The values of `input_value`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. The variable `eli` is assigned the result of the `bisect_left` function, which returns the index of the leftmost insertion point.
