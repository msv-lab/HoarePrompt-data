Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `arr[i]` is an integer.
   - Depending on the value of `arr[i]`, either `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1` and `mex` is set to `minn`, or `mex` is updated to a list containing `maxx`, which is the maximum value among all `abs(arr[j] - minn)` for all elements `arr[j]` in the array.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

5. **Postconditions for the next iteration**:
   - The postcondition for the next iteration will depend on the value of `arr[i+1]`.
   - If `arr[i+1]` is greater than 0, then `minn` will be updated to `maxx + 1` and `mex` will contain the current minimum value of `minn`.
   - If `arr[i+1]` is less than or equal to 0, then `mex` will be updated to a list containing `maxx`, which is the maximum value among all `abs(arr[j] - minn)` for all elements `arr[j]` in the array.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated values of `i` and the potential updates to `minn` and `mex`.

**State:**
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `n` remains the same
- `minn` and `mex` will be updated based on the value of `arr[i+1]`

Since the exact values of `minn` and `mex` depend on the value of `arr[i+1]`, we cannot specify them without knowing the value of `arr[i+1]`. However, we can describe the conditions under which they will be updated.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be the same, `minn` and `mex` will be updated based on the value of `arr[i+1]`**
