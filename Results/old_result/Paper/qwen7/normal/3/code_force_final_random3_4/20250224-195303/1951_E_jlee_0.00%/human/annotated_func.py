#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` can be rearranged to form a palindrome by removing at most one character. If such a rearrangement is possible, it prints "YES" along with the number of characters to remove (either 1 or 2) and the two resulting substrings. If no such rearrangement is possible, it prints "NO". The function handles up to 10,000 test cases, with each string `s` having a maximum length of 1,000,000 characters.
