Output State: **`vx` has at least one less element, `v2` is now the third last element of `vx`, `ops` has an additional element `(None, 0)` and `(None, 0)`.**

Explanation: The code adds two tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` to the list `ops`. However, since `v3` is no longer defined, it is replaced with `None`. The values of `vx` and `v2` remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, `vx` has at least one less element, `v2` is still the third last element of `vx`, and `ops` now includes the new elements `(None, 0)` and `(None, 0)`.
