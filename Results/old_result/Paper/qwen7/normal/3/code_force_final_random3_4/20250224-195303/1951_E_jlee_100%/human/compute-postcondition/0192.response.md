Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` must be greater than 4, `done` is False, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop (if there was one). Since no variables are updated or affected by the `continue` statement, their previous states remain unchanged.
