Output State: `operations` is 6; `heap` has had its smallest element (which was the minimum element in the original array starting from the median) replaced with `smallest + 1` three more times, meaning the smallest element in the heap has been incremented four times in total. The `smallest` variable holds the value of the smallest element in the heap after the last operation, which is now `smallest + 4`. The `heap` is still a min-heap, but it no longer contains the original elements from the median index onwards; instead, it contains elements that are each one greater than their original values, up to the point where the smallest element was incremented four times.
