Output State: The list `s` will contain 30 elements, each being either '1' or '0'. The value of each element in `s` depends on the bitwise AND operation between `x` and \(2^i\), where \(i\) ranges from 0 to 29. Specifically, if `x & (2^i)` is greater than 0, the corresponding element in `s` will be '1'; otherwise, it will be '0'. The variable `i` will be 29 after the loop has executed all its iterations, `length` will still be 30, and `t` and `nalla` will retain their initial values since they are not affected by the loop.
