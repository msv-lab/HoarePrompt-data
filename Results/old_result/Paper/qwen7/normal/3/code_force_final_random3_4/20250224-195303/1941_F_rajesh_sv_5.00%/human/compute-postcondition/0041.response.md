Output State: **`l` is the index such that all elements in `D` before index `l` are less than `left - f`, and `l` is the smallest index where `D[l]` is greater than or equal to `left - f`.**

Explanation: The code `l = bisect_right(D, left - f)` uses the `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point for `left - f` in the sorted list `D`. This insertion point is the smallest index `l` such that all elements in `D` before index `l` are less than `left - f`, and `D[l]` is greater than or equal to `left - f`. The value of `l` is assigned to the variable `l`. The states of the other variables (`F`, `D`, `left`, and `f`) remain unchanged.
