Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be between 2 and 50 inclusive
- The value of `v[v[v[i]]]` equals 1

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print(2)` executes.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The value of `i` is explicitly given as 1.
2. The value of `v[v[v[i]]]` is explicitly given as 1. This means `v[v[v[1]]] = 1`.
3. The `print(2)` statement does not depend on any of the variables `i`, `n`, or the value of `v[v[v[i]]]`. It simply prints the integer 2.

Therefore, the output of the `print(2)` statement is:

Output: **2**
