Based on the initial state provided, the variable `rev_res` is described as follows:

- It is the sum of all integers in `rev_val`.
- For each element in `rev_val` indexed by `x`:
  - If `x` is even, the integer value of `rev_val[x]` is added to `rev_res`.
  - If `x` is odd, the reversed integer value of `rev_val[x]` is added to `rev_res`.

Additionally, `rev_res` is stated to be less than or equal to \(10^{\text{int(max_power)}}\).

However, the print statement in question is simply:
```python
print('Anna')
```

This print statement does not reference any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. Instead, it directly prints the string `'Anna'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Anna**
