Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `t` is `t`, `a` is a new input string, `count` is the number of '1's in `a`, `n` is an input integer. If `count` is 0, the values of `i`, `t`, `a`, `count`, and `n` remain unchanged. If `count` is not 0, the values of `i`, `t`, `a`, `count`, and `n` also remain unchanged.
