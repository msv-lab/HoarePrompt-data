Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `x` is 2, `b[i]` is `b[1] + 2`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b[i]` to `b[i - 1] + x`. Given that `i` is 2, `b[i]` becomes `b[1] + x`. Since `x` is 2 (as `a[2]` is not greater than 1), `b[2]` is now `b[1] + 2`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged.
