Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and an integer `x` (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000). For each test case, it checks the relationship between `t` and `x` and returns a specific value based on the comparison.**

This means the function is designed to process multiple test cases, each containing two integers `t` and `x`. It does not take these integers as direct parameters but rather processes them within the function body according to specified conditions and returns a result for each test case.
