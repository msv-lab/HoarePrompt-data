Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x` and `rev_val`.

2. **Determine the initial state before the loop starts**: 
   - `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least three elements.
   - `rev_val` is a sorted list of the reversed integers of the reversed strings in `operational_list` whose reverse does not have the same length as the original string.
   - `rev_res` is the sum of all integers in `rev_val` plus the integer value of the last element of `operational_list` if its reverse has the same length as the original string, otherwise it includes the reversed integer of the last element.
   - `y` remains 1.
   - `rev_res` is increased by either the value of the first element of `rev_val` (if `x` is even) or the reverse of the first element of `rev_val` (if `x` is odd).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each element in `rev_val`, so `x` ranges from `0` to `len(rev_val) - 1`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the last index processed in `rev_val`.
   - For the next iteration, `x` will be incremented by 1.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `x` will be incremented by 1.
   - Since the loop body is omitted, no other variables are directly affected by the loop itself.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `x` will be `x + 1`.
- `rev_res` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but since the loop body is omitted, it stays the same.
- `operational_list`, `rev_val`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least three elements, `rev_val` is a sorted list of the reversed integers of the reversed strings in `operational_list` whose reverse does not have the same length as the original string, `rev_res` is the sum of all integers in `rev_val` plus the integer value of the last element of `operational_list` if its reverse has the same length as the original string, otherwise it includes the reversed integer of the last element, `y` remains 1, and `x` is `x + 1`**.
