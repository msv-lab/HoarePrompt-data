Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 50 inclusive, `x` is an input integer.**

The code `x = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `x`. The initial state of `i` being 0 and `n` being between 2 and 50 inclusive remains unchanged. The input for `x` is taken from the user, but since no specific input is given, `x` is described as "an input integer."
