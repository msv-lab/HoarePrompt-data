Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least three elements, `rev_val` is a sorted list of the reversed integers of the reversed strings in `operational_list` whose reverse does not have the same length as the original string, `rev_res` is the sum of all integers in `rev_val` plus the integer value of the last element of `operational_list` if its reverse has the same length as the original string, otherwise it includes the reversed integer of the last element, `y` remains 1, `x` is `x + 1`, `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[x]`, `rev_res` is updated by adding `str(val_in)` to it.**

In natural language, the output state is: `operational_list` remains unchanged, `rev_val` remains unchanged, `rev_res` is updated by converting `val_in` (which is the integer value of the element at index `x` in `rev_val`) to a string and adding it to `rev_res`, `y` remains 1, `x` is incremented by 1, and `val_in` is the integer value of the element at index `x` in `rev_val`.
