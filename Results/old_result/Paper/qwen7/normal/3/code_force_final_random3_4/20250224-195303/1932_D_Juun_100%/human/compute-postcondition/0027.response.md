Output State: **`rank` and `suit` are the rank and suit of the next card; `trumps` is either an empty list or a list containing the `rank` (possibly updated); `answers` is a list containing one additional element which is a string formed by joining the elements of a list obtained by sorting `[suits[suit], rank]` and then converting each element to a string and joining them with spaces; `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values where `suits[suit]` is now `None`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `suits[suit]` to `None`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
