Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `clues` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `answers.append('Draw')` appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `i` is set to 1. After executing the line of code, `i` is incremented to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `test_cases` remains an integer within the specified range, `i` is now 2, `answers` contains the string `'Draw'`, and `clues` remains a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.
