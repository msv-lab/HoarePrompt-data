Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer input followed by a space and then the second integer `k`, `a` is a list containing two integers where the first one is `n` and the second one is `k`, `m` is the minimum of `n` and `k`, `k` is now `k - n * m`.**

Explanation: The code `k -= n * m` subtracts `n * m` from the current value of `k`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state of `k` is `k - n * m`. All other variables (`ans`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `m`) retain their initial or previously calculated values.
