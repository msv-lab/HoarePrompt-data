Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `s` is a string input by the user.
   - If `s` equals '<', `mak` is `i`, and `pans` is a list containing the value `i`.
   - Otherwise, if `s` equals '=', `pans` is a list with the value `i` appended to it.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged because the loop condition does not depend on modifying `n` within the loop itself.
   - The values of `s`, `mak`, and `pans` do not change for the next iteration since they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now `n + 1`.
   - `n` is still at least 2.
   - `s`, `mak`, and `pans` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `s` is a string input by the user, `mak` is `i` if `s` equals '<', otherwise `mak` is the same as before, `pans` is a list containing the value `i` if `s` equals '<', otherwise `pans` is a list with the value `i` appended to it.**
