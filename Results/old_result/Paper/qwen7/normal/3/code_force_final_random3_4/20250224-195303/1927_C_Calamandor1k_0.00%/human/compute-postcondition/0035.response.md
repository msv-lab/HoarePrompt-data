Postcondition: `count_a` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k` and `i` is within the range (0, `len_a`]; otherwise, `count_a` remains unchanged. `count_b` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the `else` part was executed or not, `i` is 1, and the current value of `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`.
