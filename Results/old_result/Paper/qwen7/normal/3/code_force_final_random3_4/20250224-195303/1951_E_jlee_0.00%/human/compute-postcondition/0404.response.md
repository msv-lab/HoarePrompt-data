Output: **string[:3], string[3:] (where string[:3] is the substring of string from start to index 3, and string[3:] is the substring of string starting from index 3 until the end)**

Explanation:
- `j` is explicitly given as 3.
- `string` is not explicitly defined, but we know that `string[:j]` refers to the substring of `string` from the start up to, but not including, index `j`. Therefore, `string[:j]` is `string[:3]`.
- `string[j:]` refers to the substring of `string` starting from index `j` (which is 3) until the end of the string. Therefore, `string[j:]` is `string[3:]`.

Since the exact content of `string` is not provided, we describe the substrings in terms of their indices relative to `string`.
