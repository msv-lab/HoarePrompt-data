Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1` (exclusive).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).

3. **Adjust the state of `i` and `n`**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < n + 1`, `i` must be at least 1 and less than or equal to `n`.
   - `n` must be within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 50\) to ensure the loop can execute.

4. **Consider other variables**:
   - `t`, `p`, and `v` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted based on the loop conditions.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be between 2 and 50 inclusive**
