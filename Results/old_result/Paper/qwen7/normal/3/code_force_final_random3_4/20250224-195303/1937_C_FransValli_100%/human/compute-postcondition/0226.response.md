Output State: **`mini` is `item`, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is `n-1`, `res` is an input string which is either '<' or '=', `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1`, `item` is `arr[2]`**

Explanation: The code `mini = item` simply assigns the value of `item` to `mini`. Since `item` is already defined as `arr[2]`, `mini` now holds the same value as `item`. All other variables remain unchanged.
