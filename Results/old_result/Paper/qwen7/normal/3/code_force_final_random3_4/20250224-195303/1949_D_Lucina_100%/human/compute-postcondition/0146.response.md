Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 24, `sa` is a list containing 1 and 3.**

Explanation: The code `sa.append(i)` appends the value of `i`, which is 3, to the list `sa`. Initially, `sa` contains only the value 1. After appending 3 to `sa`, `sa` will contain both 1 and 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
