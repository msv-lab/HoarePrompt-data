Output State: **`i` is the smallest remaining value in `tmp`, `ans` is the sum of all elements in `tmp` that were successfully subtracted from `y` without making `y` negative, `tmp` is an empty list, `y` is the remaining value after all valid subtractions from `tmp` have been made, and `ans` is incremented by `y`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be the smallest remaining value in `tmp`, `ans` will be the total of all valid subtractions performed on `y`, `tmp` will be empty, `y` will hold the remaining value if any after all valid subtractions, and `ans` will be incremented by the final value of `y`.
