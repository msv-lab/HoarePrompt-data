Postcondition: `i` is 1 more than its initial value, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `ans` will hold either the accumulated sum of twice each element starting from `s[0]` up to `s[n//2 - 1]` or the string 'AAAAAAAAA', `x` will be `n // 2` if `n` is even, and 5 if `n` is odd and at least 7, `j` will be equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, and 6 if `n` is odd and at least 7.
