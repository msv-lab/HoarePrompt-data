Output State: **`c` is either 6 or 5, `k` is 2, `ans` remains unchanged, `res[c]` is set to `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is increased by 1 if `s[k] == 'L'`, and `r` is decreased by 1 if `s[k] != 'L'`**.

Explanation: The variable `c` is incremented by 1. Since `c` was either 5 or 4 initially, it now becomes either 6 or 5. The other variables (`k`, `ans`, `res[c]`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
