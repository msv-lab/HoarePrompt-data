Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 50`, the new value of `t` must also satisfy this condition. The other variables (`n` and any others) are not mentioned in the initial state and are not affected by the given code snippet.
