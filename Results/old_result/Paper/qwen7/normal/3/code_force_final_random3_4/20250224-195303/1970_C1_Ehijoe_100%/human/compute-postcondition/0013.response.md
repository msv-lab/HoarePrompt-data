Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 3, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[v]` now includes `u`, `u` is assigned the value of the first integer input, `v` is assigned the value of the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `u` and `v`. The initial values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `nodes[v]` now includes `u`. The values of `u` and `v` are updated to the respective integer inputs.
