You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; a is a list of n integers such that -n ≤ a_i ≤ n, and there exists at least one valid permutation p that satisfies the given conditions.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `mex` will be a list containing all the values of `minn` updated during each iteration where `arr[i] > 0`, and the absolute differences between `arr[i]` and `minn` when `arr[i] <= 0`. The final value of `minn` will be the last updated value of `minn` after the loop completes, and `maxx` will be the maximum value among all the absolute differences calculated during the loop.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `mex` is a list containing all the values of `minn` updated during each iteration where `arr[i] > 0`, and the absolute differences between `arr[i]` and `minn` when `arr[i] <= 0`. The final value of `itm` is the last element of `mex`, and `maxx` is the maximum value among all the absolute differences calculated during the loop.
    print()
    #This is printed: Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and a list a of n integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n). For each test case, it checks if there exists at least one valid permutation p that satisfies certain conditions and returns a boolean value indicating whether such a permutation exists or not.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
