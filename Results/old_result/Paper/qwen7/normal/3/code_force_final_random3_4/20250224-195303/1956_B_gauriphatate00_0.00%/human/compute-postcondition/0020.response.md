Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `n` is `int(data[idx])`, `a` is a list of integers created by mapping `int` over the slice of `data` from `idx` to `idx + n`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a)`, `t` is `t - 1 and must be greater than 1**.

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The updated value of `idx` is used in subsequent operations, such as slicing `data` to create the list `a`. The conditions on `t` also remain valid.
