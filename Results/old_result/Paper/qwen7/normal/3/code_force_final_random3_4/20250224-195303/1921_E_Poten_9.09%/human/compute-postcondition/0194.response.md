Postcondition: `test_cases` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test\_cases} \leq 10^4\), `i` is 3, `answers` is a list. If `clues[1] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2] - clues[4]`, or if `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2] - clues[4]`, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'.
