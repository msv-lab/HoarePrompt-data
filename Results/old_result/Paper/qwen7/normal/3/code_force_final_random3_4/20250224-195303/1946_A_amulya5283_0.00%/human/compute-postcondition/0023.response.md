Output State: **`results` is a list containing 7, `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is `arr[median_index:]` with `heap` transformed into a min-heap without the smallest element, `operations` is 7, `smallest` is the smallest element popped from `heap`, `smallest + 1` is pushed onto `heap`, and `heap[0]` is now the final smallest element in the heap after all iterations.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `operations` (which is 7) to the `results` list. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The `results` list now contains the single value 7, while the other variables retain their respective states as described in the initial state.
