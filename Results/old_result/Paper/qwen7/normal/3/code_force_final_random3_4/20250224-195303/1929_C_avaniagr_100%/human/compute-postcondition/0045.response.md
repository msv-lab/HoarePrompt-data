Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the next line `s`, `x` is the integer value of the second space-separated token from the next line `s`, `a` is the integer value of the third space-separated token from the next line `s`.**

Explanation: The code `k, x, a = map(int, s.split())` splits the string `s` into tokens based on spaces and converts them to integers, assigning them to `k`, `x`, and `a` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
