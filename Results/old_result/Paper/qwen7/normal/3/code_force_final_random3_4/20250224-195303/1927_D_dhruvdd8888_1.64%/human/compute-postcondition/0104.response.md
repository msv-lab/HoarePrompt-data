Output State: **`ppp` is 23, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement does not modify any variables but instead skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of `ppp`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, and the program continues with the next iteration of the loop.
