To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `k`.

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `c` is an input integer.

2. **Calculation of `k`:**
   - First, `k` is initially set to `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`.
   - Next, it checks if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`. If this condition is true, `k` is updated to `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. This means that regardless of the condition, `k` will always be `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`.

Given the above steps, the value of `k` will always be `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **a + (b + c) // 3 + 1**
