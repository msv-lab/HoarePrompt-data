Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `[n, x, y]` is a list of strings obtained from input; `arr` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input().split()` takes the input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `arr`. The initial state of `t` being greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1` remains unchanged, and the list `[n, x, y]` is now a list of strings instead of integers.
