Output State: **`xx` is a 2D list, `nx` is a string with 'S' appended, `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. No other variables are affected by this code. The condition checking `xx[i][j-1]` and the logic related to appending 'S' or 'F' to `nx` based on certain conditions is not executed because the code only adds 'S' to `nx`. The value of `j` is updated to `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` from the previous iteration, but since the exact value of `j` was not specified, it remains as `k + 1`.
