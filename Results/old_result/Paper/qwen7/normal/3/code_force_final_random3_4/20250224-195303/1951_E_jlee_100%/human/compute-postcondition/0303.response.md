Postcondition: `s` is a string, `done` is True, `count` is `j`, `count2` is either incremented by 1, reset to 0, or remains unchanged, `j` is `n`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement if either `count2` is greater than `count` or `count` is greater than 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, we continue the loop.
