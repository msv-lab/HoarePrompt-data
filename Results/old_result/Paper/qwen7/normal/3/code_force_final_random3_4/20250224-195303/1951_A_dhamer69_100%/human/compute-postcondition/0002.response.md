Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The initial values of `start`, `end`, and `t` remain unchanged.
