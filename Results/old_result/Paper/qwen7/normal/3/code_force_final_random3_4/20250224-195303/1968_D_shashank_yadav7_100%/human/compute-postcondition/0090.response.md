Output State: **`k` is -2, `i` is `n - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -1 + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -1 + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b] + a[b]`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block it was inside, but it does not change the values of the variables `k`, `i`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, `b`, and `s`. Therefore, their values remain as they were in the initial state, and the only change is that we break out of the loop or conditional block.
