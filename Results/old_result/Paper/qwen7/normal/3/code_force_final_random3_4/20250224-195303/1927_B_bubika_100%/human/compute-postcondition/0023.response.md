Output State: **`t` is 1, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The initial values of `t` and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `n` depends on the input provided by the user, hence it is described as "an input integer".
