Output State: **`palka` must contain at least one element, and `i` is the next element in `palka`; `d[i]` is set to 1**.

Explanation: The code `d[i] = 1` sets the value of the dictionary `d` at key `i` to 1. The precondition that `palka` must contain at least one element and `i` is the next element in `palka` remains unchanged. Therefore, these conditions are still valid after the code execution, and the new information is that `d[i]` is now set to 1.
