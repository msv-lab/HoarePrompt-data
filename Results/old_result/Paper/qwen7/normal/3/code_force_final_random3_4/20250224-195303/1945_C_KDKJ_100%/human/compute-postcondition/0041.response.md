Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `left` is `S[0][0]`, `lsum` is 0, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n - i`. If the condition `(left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum)` is true, then the postcondition remains as the initial values. Otherwise, `ans` is either 0 or the value that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, while ensuring that the condition `(left * 2 >= lsum) and (right * 2 >= rsum)` still holds true.
