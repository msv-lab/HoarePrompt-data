Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `n + r + 1` is derived from the condition where \( r \) is the largest integer such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \).
   - \( j > n \) is also given, but this condition does not affect the range function directly since we are only concerned with the `range(1, n + 1)` part.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*range(1, n + 1))
   ```

To determine the value of `n + 1`, we need to find the largest integer \( r \) such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \).

Let's analyze the inequality:
\[ r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \]
\[ 2r \times n < n \times (n + 1) \]
\[ 2r < n + 1 \]
\[ r < \frac{n + 1}{2} \]

The largest integer \( r \) satisfying this inequality is \( \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor \). Therefore:
\[ n + r + 1 = n + \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor + 1 \]

Given \( j > n \) and \( j \) is 1, it implies \( n \) must be 0 or less, but since \( n \) must be a positive integer (as it is used in the range function), let's assume \( n \) is a positive integer.

For simplicity, let's assume \( n = 1 \):
- If \( n = 1 \), then \( r = \left\lfloor \frac{1 + 1}{2} \right\rfloor = 1 \).
- Therefore, \( n + r + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \).

So, the range function will generate numbers from 1 to \( n + 1 = 2 \).

Thus, the `range(1, n + 1)` will produce the sequence `[1, 2]`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **1 2**
