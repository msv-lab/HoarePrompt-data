To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `k` is the first integer input converted to an integer.
   - `q` is the second integer input converted to an integer.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended with `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
   - `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers with at least one element removed.
   - `n` is the next element in `qs`.
   - `res` is updated with `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
   ```

From the initial state, we know that `res` is a list that contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice. Specifically, `res` is updated to include `func_1(n, p)` once more after the code snippet runs.

Let's denote the result of `func_1(n, p)` as `result`. Therefore, `res` will be `[result, result]`.

When the `print` statement executes, it will join the elements of `res` into a single string, separated by spaces, and then print this string.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **result result** (where `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`).
