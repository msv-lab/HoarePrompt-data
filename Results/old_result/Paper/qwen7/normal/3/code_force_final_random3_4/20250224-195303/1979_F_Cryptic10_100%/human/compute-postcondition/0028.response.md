Output State: **`v1` is `len(vx) - 3`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 2`, `vx` is the list with one element removed at index `v1`, `v3` is the first element returned by `q(0)`**.

This means that `v1`, `v2`, and the state of `vx` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only new information is that `v3` is assigned the first element returned by the function `q(0)`. `_` is typically used to discard the second element of a tuple returned by `q(0)`, but since we are focusing on the updated state, we include `v3` in the output state.
