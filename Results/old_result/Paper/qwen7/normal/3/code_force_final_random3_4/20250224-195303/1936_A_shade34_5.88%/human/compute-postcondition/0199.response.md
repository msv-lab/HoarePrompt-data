Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`
- `n` is at least 2

However, the values of `mak`, `mak2` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine their exact values without additional information.

Given this, the print statement will output a string with placeholders for `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`.

Output: **'? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2]' (where [mak] and [mak2] are unknown values, and [i] is the value of n, which is at least 2)**
