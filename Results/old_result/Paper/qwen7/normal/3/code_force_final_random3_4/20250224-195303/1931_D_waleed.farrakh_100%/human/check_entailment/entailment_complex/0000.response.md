Reasoning:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly processes each test case by iterating through the array `arr` and calculating the frequency of pairs `(rx, ry)` where `rx` is the remainder when `-a % x + x` is taken modulo `x` and `ry` is the remainder when `a % y` is taken modulo `y`. It then uses this frequency to count the number of beautiful pairs and appends the count to the `results` list.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function correctly reads the input data from standard input, processes it into a format suitable for `func_1`, and then calls `func_1` to get the results. It then prints the results for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the provided annotations, both functions seem to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Function 1 processes each test case as expected, and Function 2 correctly handles the input reading and processing.

Therefore, the overall program is correct because both functions work together to process the input data and produce the correct output as per the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
