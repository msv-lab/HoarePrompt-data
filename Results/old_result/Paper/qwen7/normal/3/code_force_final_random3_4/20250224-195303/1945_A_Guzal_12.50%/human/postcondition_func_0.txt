The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. For each test case, it calculates a value based on specific conditions involving these integers and prints the result. If certain conditions are met, it adjusts the calculated value accordingly. The function ultimately outputs the cumulative sum of these adjusted values for all test cases.
