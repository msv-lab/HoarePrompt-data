Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is either `n-1` or any value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, and `i` is `n`.**

In this case, the code simply assigns the value of `mak` to `mak2`. Since `mak` can be either `n-1` or any value between 0 and `n-2`, `mak2` will take on the same value as `mak`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `n`.
