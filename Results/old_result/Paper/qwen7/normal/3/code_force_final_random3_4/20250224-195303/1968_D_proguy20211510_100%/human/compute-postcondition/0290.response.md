Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[i-1] + pathb[i]`, `curr` is unchanged, `resb` is the maximum of its current value and `preb + pathb[i-1] * (k - (i-1))`.**

Explanation: The code updates `preb` by adding `pathb[i]` to its current value. The other variables (`i`, `curr`, and `resb`) are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, `i` is incremented by 1, `preb` is updated to include the new value `pathb[i]`, and `curr` and `resb` remain unchanged from their previous values.
