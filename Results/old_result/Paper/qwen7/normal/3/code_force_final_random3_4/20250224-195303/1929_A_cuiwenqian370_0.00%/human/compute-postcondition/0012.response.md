Output State: **`left` is 1, `right` is greater than or equal to 0, and `new_arr` is a list containing either the element `arr[1]` (if `left` equals `right`) or the elements `arr[right]` and `arr[left]` (if `left` does not equal `right`).**

Explanation: The variable `left` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The conditions for `right` and the definition of `new_arr` remain unchanged.
