Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `rev_res` is a string that alternates between the integer values of `rev_val` and their reversed forms, starting with the first element of `rev_val` and ending with its last element. If the final value of `rev_res` is greater than \(10^{\text{int(max_power)}}\), the loop prints 'Sasha'; otherwise, it prints 'Anna'.**

This output state describes the final value of `rev_res` after the loop has executed for all iterations. It also specifies the condition under which the loop prints 'Sasha' or 'Anna'. The process involves reversing each string in `operational_list`, sorting the resulting list of reversed integers (`rev_val`), and then constructing `rev_res` by alternating between the integer values of `rev_val` and their reversed forms, based on whether the index is even or odd.
