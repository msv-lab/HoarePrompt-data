Output State: **`current_pair` is (a % x, a % y), `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` contains at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `rx` is (-`a` % `x` + `x`) % `x`, `ry` is `a` % `y`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the pair `(a % x, a % y)` to the variable `current_pair`. This means `current_pair` now holds the values of `a % x` and `a % y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
