Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `b` is a list of 26 zeros; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `s`. The values of `t`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
