Postcondition: `count` is an integer, `s` is a string, `k` and `j` are indices within the string `s`. `count` is increased by 1 for each position `i` where `i` ranges from 0 to `j-1`, such that the character at index `k+i` in `s` is either a '?' or the character at index `k+i` in `s` is the same as the character at index `k` in `s`. Otherwise, `count` remains 0, and the final value of `count` is equal to `j`.
