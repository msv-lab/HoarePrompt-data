Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head conditions**: The loop continues as long as `n != 0`, `k > 0`, `rep < 60`, and `n >= k`.

2. **Analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `rep` is 2.
   - `n` is `n - Min * Max`.
   - `k` is either `k - Max` or `k - Min`.
   - `Min` and `Max` are recalculated based on the new value of `k`.
   - `number` is added to the list `tab` as a string.

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - `rep`: Since `rep` is set to 2 at the start of each iteration and is incremented within the loop, it is not necessary to adjust `rep` for the loop to continue.
   - `n`: `n` is updated as `n - Min * Max`. For the loop to continue, `n` must be non-zero.
   - `k`: `k` is updated as either `k - Max` or `k - Min`. For the loop to continue, `k` must be greater than 0.
   - `Min` and `Max`: These values are recalculated based on the new value of `k`, but they do not affect the loop condition directly.
   - `number` and `tab`: These variables are used to store intermediate results and do not affect the loop condition.

4. **Ensure the loop can continue**:
   - `n` must be non-zero (`n != 0`).
   - `k` must be greater than 0 (`k > 0`).
   - `rep` must be less than 60 (`rep < 60`).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `k` (`n >= k`).

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n`, `k`, and `rep`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`rep` is less than 60, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is either `k - Max` or `k - Min`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`**.
