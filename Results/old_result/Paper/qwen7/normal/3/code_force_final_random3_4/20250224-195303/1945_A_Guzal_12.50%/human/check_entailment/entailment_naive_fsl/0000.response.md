Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of tents is flawed. Let's consider the following test case:

- Input: `1 2 1` (1 introvert, 2 extroverts, 1 universal)

According to the problem description:
- The introvert needs 1 tent.
- The 2 extroverts need 1 tent together.
- The universal can share a tent with either the introvert or the extroverts.

The correct solution would be:
- 1 tent for the introvert.
- 1 tent for the 2 extroverts.
- 1 tent for the universal and the remaining extrovert.

So, the total number of tents required is 3.

However, the given program incorrectly calculates the number of tents. For the input `1 2 1`, the program prints `-1` because `(b + c) % 3 != 0` evaluates to `True`, which triggers the `-1` output.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly account for the different combinations of introverts, extroverts, and universals. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        k = 0
        
        # Tents for introverts
        k += a
        
        # Remaining people after allocating tents for introverts
        remaining_extroverts = b
        remaining_universals = c
        
        # Tents for extroverts
        if remaining_extroverts >= 2:
            k += remaining_extroverts // 3
            remaining_extroverts %= 3
        
        # Tents for universals
        if remaining_extroverts > 0:
            k += remaining_extroverts // 2
            remaining_universals -= remaining_extroverts // 2
        
        # Tents for remaining universals
        k += remaining_universals // 3
        
        print(k)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles all potential cases correctly.
