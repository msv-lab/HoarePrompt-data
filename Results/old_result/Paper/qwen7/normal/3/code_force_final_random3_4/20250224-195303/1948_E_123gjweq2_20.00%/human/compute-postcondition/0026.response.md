The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. Both `left` and `right` are integers where `left` is less than `right`, and `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier. The function does not explicitly return any value based on the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `make_array` is to accept two integers `left` and `right` (with `left` being less than `right`) and an integer `clique` representing a clique identifier, without specifying what action or output the function produces.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `left` and `right` (with `left` less than `right`) and an integer `clique` representing a clique identifier, without specifying any explicit return value.**
