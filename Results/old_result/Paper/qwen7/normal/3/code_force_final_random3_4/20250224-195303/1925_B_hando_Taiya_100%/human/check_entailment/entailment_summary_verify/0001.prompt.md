You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: t, x, and n. For each test case, it finds and prints the largest divisor of x such that either the divisor or its complement (x divided by the divisor) is less than or equal to n.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - A function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is an issue because the function should be called to process each test case.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - Inside the loop, it calls `func_1()`, which is incorrect because `func_1()` does not take any arguments and is not defined to handle the input directly.

4. **Function Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1()`:
     - Takes `x` and `n` as inputs.
     - Initializes `ans` to 0.
     - Iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `x`.
     - Checks if `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - If `i` is a divisor, it checks two conditions:
       - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
       - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
     - Prints the final value of `ans`.

5. **Logic and Output:**
   - The logic in `func_1()` is correct for finding the maximum balance.
   - However, since `func_1()` is not being called within the main loop, the program will not process any test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not call the function `func_1()` to process the test cases. The function `func_1()` is defined but never used in the main loop.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from math import isqrt

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)
```
