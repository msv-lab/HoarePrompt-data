Output State: **`minn` is set to infinity, `ar` is a list of integers created from the input, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `num` is `ar[0]`, `same` is 1, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was set to 1, so after executing this line, `i` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
