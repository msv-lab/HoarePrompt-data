Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `e` equals `t`, `l` is the length of the `nums` list, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `x` holds the maximum value found in the `nums` list, and `y` holds the minimum value found in the `nums` list.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `e` will be equal to `t` because the loop runs exactly `t` times. The variable `x` will hold the maximum value found in the `nums` list across all the lists processed during the loop's execution, and `y` will hold the minimum value found in the `nums` list across all the lists processed during the loop's execution. The other variables (`t` and `l`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop, and `nums` is updated with each new list of integers provided by the user.
