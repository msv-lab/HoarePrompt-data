Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.**

The variable `k` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, which is calculated using the `abs()` function. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
