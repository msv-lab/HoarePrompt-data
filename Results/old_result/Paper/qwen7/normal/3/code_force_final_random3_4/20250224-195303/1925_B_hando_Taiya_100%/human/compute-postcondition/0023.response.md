Postcondition: `total` is 0, `i` is a divisor of `x` plus 1, `isqrt(x) + 1` must be a positive integer, and `ans` is the maximum value between the previous `ans` and `x // i`. If `x % i == 0`, then `ans` is updated to `x // i` if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, otherwise `ans` remains the maximum value between the previous `ans` and `x // i`.
