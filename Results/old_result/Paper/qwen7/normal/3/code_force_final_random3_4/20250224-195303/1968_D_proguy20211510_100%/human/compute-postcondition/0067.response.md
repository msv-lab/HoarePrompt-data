Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is less than 2, `curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`**

Explanation: The code `preb += pathb[i]` increments `preb` by the value of `pathb[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[1]`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `curr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
