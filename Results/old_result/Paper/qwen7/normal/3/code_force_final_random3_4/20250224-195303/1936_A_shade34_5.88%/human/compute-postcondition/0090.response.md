Output State: **`mak` is 0, `i` must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 2**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variable values. It flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which means any buffered data is immediately written to the terminal or file. However, since no variables are involved in this operation, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the conditions and values of `mak`, `i`, and `n` stay the same as in the initial state.
