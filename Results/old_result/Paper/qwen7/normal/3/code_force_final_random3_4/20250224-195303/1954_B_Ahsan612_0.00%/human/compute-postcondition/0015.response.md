Output State: **`same` is 1, `minn` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is `ar[3]`, `i` is 3, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1.**

The code `same = 1` simply reassigns the value of `same` to 1, which does not change the fact that `same` was initially 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
