Reasoning:
The provided program checks whether either dimension of the rectangle is even. If at least one dimension is even, it correctly determines that Bob can form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into smaller rectangles and rearranging them. However, the logic in the program does not fully capture the problem's requirements. Specifically, the program fails to consider the condition where both dimensions are odd, which should also allow Bob to form another rectangle under certain conditions (as demonstrated in the examples).

To be more precise, the program's logic is:
- If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, print 'Yes'.
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, print 'No'.

This logic is incorrect because:
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, Bob can still form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into smaller rectangles and rearranging them. For example, a 3x3 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 1x6 rectangle.

Therefore, the program incorrectly prints 'No' for cases where both dimensions are odd, when it should print 'Yes'.

Correctness: **False**
