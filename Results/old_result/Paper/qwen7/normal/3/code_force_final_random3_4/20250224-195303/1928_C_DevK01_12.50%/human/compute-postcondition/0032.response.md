Postcondition: `i` is 3, `w` is the integer part of the square root of `q` and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `q` is divisible by `i`, and `M` is a list containing the elements 1, `q // i`, `i`, and `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is modified to include an additional `i`.
