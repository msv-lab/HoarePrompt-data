Output State: **`left` is 2, `right` is `right - 1`, `new_arr` contains either the element from `arr` at index 2 (if `left` equals `right`), or the elements `arr[1]` and `arr[right]` (if `left` does not equal `right`).**

Explanation: The variable `right` is decremented by 1. The value of `left` remains unchanged at 2, and the condition for determining the contents of `new_arr` remains the same. Therefore, `new_arr` will contain either the element from `arr` at index 2 (if `left` equals `right` after decrementing `right`), or the elements `arr[1]` and `arr[right]` (if `left` does not equal `right` after decrementing `right`).
