Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n; `N` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())`; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `num` is the first element of `nums`; `arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
