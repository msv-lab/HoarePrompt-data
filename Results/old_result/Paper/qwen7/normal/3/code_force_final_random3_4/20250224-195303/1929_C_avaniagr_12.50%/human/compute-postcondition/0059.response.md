Output State: `k` is an input integer, `x` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is equal to `x + x + 1`, `z` is `x + 1`

Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, the value of `i` increments by 1, starting from `x`. Therefore, after `x + 1` iterations, `i` will be equal to `x + (x + 1) = 2x + 1`. The variable `z` increases by 1 with each iteration, so after `x + 1` iterations, `z` will be equal to `x + 1`.
