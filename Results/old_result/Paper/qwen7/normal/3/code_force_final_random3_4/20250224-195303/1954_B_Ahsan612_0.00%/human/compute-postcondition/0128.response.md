Output State: **`minn` is 1, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[i]`, `ar` is updated with the first 6 integers from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, and `len(ar)` is 6.**

Explanation: The code `same = 1` simply reassigns the variable `same` to the value `1`. The values of `minn`, `num`, `ar`, `i`, and `len(ar)` remain unchanged from their initial states.
