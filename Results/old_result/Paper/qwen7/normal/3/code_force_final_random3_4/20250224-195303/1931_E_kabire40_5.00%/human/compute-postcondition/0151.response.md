Postcondition: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least three elements, `rev_val` is a sorted list of the reversed integers of the reversed strings in `operational_list` whose reverse does not have the same length as the original string, `rev_res` is the sum of all integers in `rev_val` plus the integer value of the last element of `operational_list` if its reverse has the same length as the original string, otherwise it includes the reversed integer of the last element, `y` remains 1, `x` is `x + 1`, and `rev_res` is updated by adding either `str(val_in)` or the reverse of `val_in` to it, where `val_in` is the integer value of the current element in `rev_val` based on the condition of the if statement.**
