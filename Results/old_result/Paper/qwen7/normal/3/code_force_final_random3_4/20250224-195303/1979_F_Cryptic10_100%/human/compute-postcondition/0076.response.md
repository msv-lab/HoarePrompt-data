Output State: `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive), but with the last two integers removed. `ops` is a list containing tuples that were added during each iteration of the loop, with the final state depending on the value of `v2` in the last iteration.

If `v2` is greater than 0 in the last iteration, `ops` will contain the tuples added in each iteration up to the last one, ending with the tuple `(v1, v2)`, where `v1` is `len(vx) - 3` and `v2` is `len(vx) - 1`.

If `v2` is less than or equal to 0 in the last iteration, `ops` will contain the tuples added in each iteration up to the second last one, followed by the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, where `v3` is the result of the call to `q(0)` in the second last iteration, and `v1` is `len(vx) - 3`.
