Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `previous_j + 1`, and `i` is increased by 1.**

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 0, `j` is still `previous_j + 1`, and `i` is increased by 1.
