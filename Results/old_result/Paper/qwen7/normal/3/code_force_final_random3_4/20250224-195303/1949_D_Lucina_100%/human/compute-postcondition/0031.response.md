Output State: **`a[i]` and `a[j_prev + 1]` are integers; `b[i]` is increased by 1; `b[j_prev + 1]` remains unchanged; `b[j]` is increased by 1 if `x[j_prev]` is neither 'F' nor 'S', otherwise `b[j_prev + 1]` is increased by 1 if `x[j_prev]` equals 'S'.**

This means that the value of `b[j]` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain in their previous states as described.
