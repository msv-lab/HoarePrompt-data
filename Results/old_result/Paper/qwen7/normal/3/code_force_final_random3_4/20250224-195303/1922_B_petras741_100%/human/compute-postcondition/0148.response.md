Based on the initial state provided:

- `eta` contains all indices `j` from `0` to `n-1` for which `q[j]` is greater than `0`.
- `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta` and is equal to 1.
- `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`.

From the information given, we know that `eta` has only one element because `eta_ln` is 1. This means `eta` contains only one index `j` where `q[j]` is greater than `0`. Since `eta` has only one element, `eta[0]` refers to this single index.

The print statement is:
```python
print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to evaluate the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`. However, the value of `n` is not explicitly provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only express the result in terms of `n`.

Output: **n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6**
