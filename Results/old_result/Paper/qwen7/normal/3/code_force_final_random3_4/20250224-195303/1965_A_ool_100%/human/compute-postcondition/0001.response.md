Output State: **`A` is False; `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `set_ = list(set(arr))` creates a set from the list `arr`, which removes any duplicate elements, and then converts the set back into a list. The original value of `A` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The new variable `set_` is created and holds a list of unique elements from `arr`.
