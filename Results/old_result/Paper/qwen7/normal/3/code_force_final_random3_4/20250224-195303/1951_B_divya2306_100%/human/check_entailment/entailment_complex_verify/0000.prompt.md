You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The list a is a list of n distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

    #State: Output State: `wins` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element from the input split into an integer, `i` is 3.
    #
    #**Explanation**: The loop continues to increment the `wins` variable as long as the condition `a[i] > a[k - 1]` is not met. After the loop has executed 3 times, it means that `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` were all less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`. The loop will continue to execute until `a[i]` becomes greater than `a[k - 1]` or until `i` reaches `n`. Since the loop has already executed 3 times, `i` is now 3. If `a[3]` is not greater than `a[k - 1]`, then `wins` will still be 3 after all iterations of the loop.
    if (wins >= k) :
        print(wins - 1)
        #This is printed: 2
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `wins` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element from the input split into an integer, and `a[3]` is less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`
    win_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        win_with_swap += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `win_with_swap` is equal to `k - 1`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `win_with_swap` as long as `a[i]` is less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` and `i` is less than `k - 1`. After 3 iterations, `win_with_swap` has been incremented 3 times. Since the loop condition checks `i < k - 1`, once `i` reaches `k - 1`, the loop will terminate. Therefore, `win_with_swap` will be set to `k - 1` when the loop finishes. All other variables' states remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))
    #This is printed: k - 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers `n` and `k` followed by a list of `n` distinct integers `a`. It then counts the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to the `k-1`th element. If this count (`wins`) is at least `k`, it prints `wins - 1` and returns. Otherwise, it calculates a new count (`win_with_swap`) by considering the possibility of swapping one element. Finally, it prints the maximum of `wins - 1` and `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)` and returns `None`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not account for the possibility of swapping the position of the cow with another cow to maximize the number of wins. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Logic**: The program attempts to count the number of cows with ratings less than the cow at position `k-1` (i.e., cow `k`). This logic is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of swapping positions to potentially increase the number of wins.

2. **Swap Logic**: The program calculates `win_with_swap` by assuming the cow at position `k-1` is swapped with a cow at position `i` such that `i > k-1`. However, this approach is incomplete and does not cover all possible swaps. It only checks for a specific range of positions and does not explore all valid swaps.

3. **Edge Cases**: Consider the following example:
   - **Input**:
     ```
     3
     6 1
     12 10 14 11 8 3
     ```
   - **Expected Output**: `1`
   - **Actual Output**: The program outputs `0` because it does not correctly handle the scenario where swapping positions could lead to more wins.

To fix the program, we need to:
- Calculate the number of cows with ratings less than the cow at position `k-1`.
- Explore all possible positions to swap with and calculate the maximum number of wins for each swap.
- Return the maximum number of wins among the original position and all possible swaps.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initial number of wins without any swap
        wins_without_swap = sum(1 for i in range(k - 1) if a[i] > a[k - 1])
        
        # Find the best position to swap with
        max_wins = wins_without_swap
        for i in range(k, n):
            if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
                break
            wins_with_swap = wins_without_swap + 1 + sum(1 for j in range(k) if a[j] > a[i])
            max_wins = max(max_wins, wins_with_swap)
        
        print(max_wins)
```

This corrected version ensures that all possible swaps are considered and the maximum number of wins is calculated accurately.
