Output State: **`cnt` is -1, `i` is 2, `x` is `n - 1`**

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `n - (i * i - i)`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the expression simplifies to `x = n - (1 * 1 - 1)`, which further simplifies to `x = n - 0`, hence `x = n`. Since `i` was 1 and the code increments `i` by 1, `i` becomes 2. The values of `cnt` and `m` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
