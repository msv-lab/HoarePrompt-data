Postcondition: `s` is a string, `done` is True, `count` is `j`, `count2` is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged (or reset to 0), `j` is `n`. If `count` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `count2` is greater than `count`, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
