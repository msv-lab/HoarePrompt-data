Based on the initial state provided:

- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained from input.
- `i` is equal to `x`.

The code snippet provided is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, or `i`. Since no other operations are performed on these variables before the print statement, their values do not affect the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **NO**
