Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k` for each case.
2. **Loop Execution**: The program uses a while loop to simulate Alice's greedy buying process. It calculates the minimum and maximum number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall based on the current values of `n` and `k`.
3. **Conditions Check**: The conditions inside the loop ensure that Alice buys the maximum possible jewels from each stall without exceeding her available coins (`n`) and the desired number of jewels (`k`).
4. **Output**: If `k` reaches zero, it means Alice has bought exactly `k` jewels, and the program prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls used and the prices per jewel for those stalls. If `k` is not zero after processing all possible stalls, it prints "NO".

The provided code appears to follow the logic required to solve the problem correctly. However, there are a few potential issues that need to be addressed:

- **Edge Cases**: The program should handle edge cases where `n` is less than `k` initially, which might lead to incorrect behavior.
- **Stall Limit**: The program should ensure that the number of stalls does not exceed 60.
- **Precision**: Given the large values of `n` and `k`, the division operations should be handled carefully to avoid precision issues.

Despite these considerations, the core logic of the program seems to align with the problem statement. Therefore, assuming the input is valid and the edge cases are handled appropriately, the program should work correctly.

Correctness: **True**
