### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code and compare it with the problem statement and the expected output.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers `p_i` representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.
   - It calculates the result using the expression `sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3`.
   - Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

3. **Expression Analysis**:
   - The expression `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)` seems to be calculating something related to the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - Specifically, `x // 2` gives the integer division of `x` by 2, and `x % 2` gives the remainder when `x` is divided by 2.
   - Multiplying by 3 and adding the remainder ensures that the contribution of each count is appropriately weighted.
   - Dividing the sum by 3 at the end suggests an averaging process.

4. **Expected Calculation**:
   - Given the problem, the optimal strategy for Eve would involve removing numbers to ensure the bitwise XOR of the remaining sequence is zero as often as possible.
   - The expression `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)` seems to be a way to calculate the effective number of 1s, 2s, and 3s (since 4s do not contribute to the XOR being zero).

5. **Verification**:
   - Let's verify the expression with some examples:
     - For `p = [1, 1, 1, 0]`: 
       - 1 contributes 1 (since 1 // 2 = 0, 1 % 2 = 1)
       - 1 contributes 1 (since 1 // 2 = 0, 1 % 2 = 1)
       - 1 contributes 1 (since 1 // 2 = 0, 1 % 2 = 1)
       - 0 contributes 0
       - Sum = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3
       - Result = 3 // 3 = 1
     - For `p = [1, 0, 1, 2]`:
       - 1 contributes 1
       - 0 contributes 0
       - 1 contributes 1
       - 2 contributes 2 (since 2 // 2 = 1, 2 % 2 = 0)
       - Sum = 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 4
       - Result = 4 // 3 = 1

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win.
   - The expression and the logic align with the problem requirements.
