Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string input by the user, we read an input but did not assign it to any variable except `trump`.**

The code assigns the input value to the variable `trump`, which means the value of `trump` is now the string input by the user. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
