Postcondition: `test_cases` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test\_cases} \leq 10^4\), `i` is 3, `answers` is a list, and `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer. If `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` is true, then `answers` is a list with 'Draw' appended. Otherwise, `answers` is a list with 'Alice' appended.
