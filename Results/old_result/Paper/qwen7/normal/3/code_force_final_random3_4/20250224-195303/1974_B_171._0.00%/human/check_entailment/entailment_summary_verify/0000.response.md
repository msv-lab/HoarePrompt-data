### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Encoding Process:**
   - Construct a string `r` containing all distinct characters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Replace each character in `s` with its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - Reverse the encoding process.
   - Given an encoded string `b`, we need to reconstruct the original string `s`.

#### Provided Program:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Constructs a mapping of characters from `encoded` to their corresponding characters in the original string.
   - For each character in `encoded`, if it is not already mapped, it finds the next available character from 'a' to 'z' and maps it.
   - Returns the decoded string by applying the mapping.

#### Function Summary:
- The function maps each character in `encoded` to another character based on a predefined mapping.
- If a character is not already mapped, it is mapped to the next available character from 'a' to 'z'.
- After processing all characters in `encoded`, it constructs and returns a new string where each character in `encoded` has been replaced according to the mapping.

#### Counterexample Analysis:
- Consider the encoded string `b = "ttt"`.
- The distinct characters in the original string are `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`, so `r = "abc"`.
- Encoding:
  - `'t'` corresponds to `'a'` in `r`, so it should be replaced by the last character of `r` (i.e., `'c'`).
  - The decoded string should be `"cbcbcb"`.
- Decoding:
  - The program will map each `'t'` to the next available character from 'a' to 'z', which results in `"fffggg"`.

#### Correct Decoding Approach:
To correctly decode the string, we need to follow these steps:
1. Identify the distinct characters in the encoded string.
2. Sort these distinct characters to form the string `r`.
3. Map each character in the encoded string to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

#### Correct Implementation:
```python
def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Find all distinct characters in the encoded string
    distinct_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    
    # Create a mapping from each character in the encoded string to its symmetric counterpart in r
    mapping = {char: distinct_chars[-(i + 1)] for i, char in enumerate(distinct_chars)}
    
    # Decode the string using the mapping
    decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    
    return decoded
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect because it does not correctly map the characters based on their positions in the sorted distinct characters string `r`. The provided program indeed fails to correctly implement the decoding process.

However, upon re-evaluating the problem and the correct approach, the provided function summary and the logic of the program can be adjusted to correctly decode the string. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
