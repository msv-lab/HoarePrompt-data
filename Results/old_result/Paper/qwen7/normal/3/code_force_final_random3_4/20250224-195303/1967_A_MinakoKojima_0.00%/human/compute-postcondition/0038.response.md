Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, `ans` is 0, `m` is the minimum value of the list `a`**.

The code sets `ans` to 0, which overwrites the previous value of `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
