Output State: **`A` is True, `not_c` is False, `i` is equal to the length of `set_`.**

Explanation: The variable `A` is initially `False`. The code snippet `A = not A` changes the value of `A` to the opposite of its current value. Since `A` was `False`, it becomes `True`. The values of `not_c` and `i` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
