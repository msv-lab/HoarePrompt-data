Output State: **`i` is 0; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l` is the integer input value; `s` is a list of `l` elements, each initialized to 0; `array` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `array = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in a list called `array`. The initial values of `i`, `t`, `l`, and `s` remain unchanged. The `array` variable now holds the list of integers entered by the user.
