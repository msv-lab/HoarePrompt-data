Output State: **`sum` is equal to either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or increased by `(i + 1) * n`, depending on whether `n * (n + 1) // 2 > (i + 1) * n` holds true; `r` is equal to `i`; `n` and `i` are integers.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value of `i` to `r`. This does not affect the value of `sum`, which remains as it was initially defined. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged as well. Therefore, the only change is that `r` is now equal to `i`.
