Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\)**.

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` remains unchanged and still satisfies the condition \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\). The function `func_1()` does not modify `n`, so its value stays the same as it was in the initial state.
