Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` must be at least 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[v]` contains all integers from 1 to n that are connected to `v` through the edges provided by the input, `ends` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `ends = []` initializes an empty list named `ends`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `u`, `v`, or the contents of the `nodes` dictionary. Therefore, the output state retains the values and conditions specified in the initial state, with the addition of the `ends` list being initialized as an empty list.
