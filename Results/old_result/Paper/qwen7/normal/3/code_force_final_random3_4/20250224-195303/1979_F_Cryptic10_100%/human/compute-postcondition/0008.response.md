Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to len(vx) - 3, `ops` is a list containing one tuple (v1, v2), and the current value of `v2` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The line `ops += [(v1, v2)]` appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. Since `v1` and `v2` are not redefined within the given code snippet, their values remain unchanged. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `vx`) also remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new tuple in the `ops` list.
