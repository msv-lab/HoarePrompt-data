Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize Bob's profit. Here's why:

1. **Binary Search Misuse**: The binary search is used incorrectly here. The goal is to find the optimal `k` to maximize profit, but the current implementation uses a condition that checks if the total profit is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. This is not the right approach to maximize profit.

2. **Profit Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the profit correctly, but the binary search logic does not help in finding the maximum profit. Instead, we should directly calculate the profit for different values of `k` from 0 to `n` and keep track of the maximum profit.

### Correct Solution:
Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(n + 1):
            profit = 0
            if k > 0:
                profit += sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(1, k + 1))
            profit += (n - k) * a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This solution iterates over all possible values of `k` from 0 to `n`, calculates the profit for each `k`, and keeps track of the maximum profit. This ensures that the maximum profit is found correctly.
