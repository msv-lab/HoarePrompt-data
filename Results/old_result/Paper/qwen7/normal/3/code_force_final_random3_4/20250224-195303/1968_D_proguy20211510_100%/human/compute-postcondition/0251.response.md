The only variable in the loop head is the boolean condition itself, which is `True`. Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute the first time regardless of the initial values of other variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the variables outside the loop head.

State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `ps` - 1 set to 1, `num_iterations` is decremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the original `n`, `k` is the integer value of the original `k`, `pb` remains at the final value it was set to after the last iteration, `ps` is the integer value of the original `ps`, `p` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `pathb` is a list containing all the elements added during each iteration of the loop, `paths` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
