Based on the initial state provided:

- `rev_res` is the sum of all integers in `rev_val` plus the concatenation of the integer value of `rev_val[x]` if `x` is even, or the reversed integer value of `rev_val[x]` if `x` is odd, for each iteration from `x = 0` to `x = len(rev_val) - 1`.
- `rev_res` is also stated to be greater than \(10\) raised to the power of `max_power`.

The `print` statement in question is simply printing the string `'Sasha'`.

Given this information, the `print` statement will output the string `'Sasha'`.

Output: **'Sasha'**
