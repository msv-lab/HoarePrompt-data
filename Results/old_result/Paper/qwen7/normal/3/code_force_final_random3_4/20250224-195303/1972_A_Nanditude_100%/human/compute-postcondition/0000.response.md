Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer. Since `t` was initially a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, the new value of `t` is now an integer input from the user within the same range. All other variables (`a`, `b`, and `n`) remain unchanged and still satisfy their initial conditions.
