Postcondition: `n` is at least 1, `s` is the first character of the string `a`. If `s` is '0', then `x` is the last character of the string `S` plus 1, and `y` is the last character of the string `S` plus 1. Otherwise, `x` is the last character of the string `S`, and `y` is the last character of the string `S` plus 1.
