Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct; `v` is a list of length n+1 where each element is equal to an integer input split from the input string and converted to an integer; `n` is not equal to 2.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
        print(2)
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `n` must be between 2 and 50 inclusive, and `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is between 2 and 50 inclusive, and `v[v[v[2]]]` is not equal to 2. If `v[v[v[2]]]` equals 2, the function returns None. Otherwise, the function does not change the values of `i`, `n`, and `v[v[v[2]]]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is between 2 and 50 inclusive, and `v[v[v[2]]]` is not equal to 2. If `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i`, the function returns None. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (or the behavior remains unchanged).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
