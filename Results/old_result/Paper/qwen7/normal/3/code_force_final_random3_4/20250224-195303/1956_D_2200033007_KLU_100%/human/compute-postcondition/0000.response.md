Output State: **`is_already_stairs` is True, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, where n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 18, and start_index is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, and res is a list that will store the operations performed.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `is_already_stairs`. This does not affect the values of `arr`, `start_index`, or `res`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
