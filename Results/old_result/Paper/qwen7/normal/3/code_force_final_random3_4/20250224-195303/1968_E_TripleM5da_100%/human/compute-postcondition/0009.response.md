Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is at least 5.
- `n` must be greater than 4.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(i, i)
```

This means the `print` statement will output the value of `i` twice. Since `i` is at least 5, it could be any integer starting from 5 onwards. However, the exact value of `i` is not specified, so we can only describe it as "at least 5".

Therefore, the output will be two instances of the value of `i`, both being at least 5.

Output: **5 5** (where 5 represents the minimum possible value of `i`)
