Output State: `is_already_stairs` remains True, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `res` is a list that will store the operations performed, and after the loop has executed all its iterations, no value in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to 17) is found to be unequal to its index `j`. This means that for every `j` in the range `0` to `17`, the condition `arr[start_index + j] == j` holds true throughout the entire execution of the loop.
