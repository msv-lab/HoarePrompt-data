Output State: **`A` is True, `not_c` is False, `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `A` is initially `False`. The code `A = not A` changes the value of `A` to `True` because the negation of `False` is `True`. The values of `not_c` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, `not_c` is still `False`, and `i` is still `i + 1`.
