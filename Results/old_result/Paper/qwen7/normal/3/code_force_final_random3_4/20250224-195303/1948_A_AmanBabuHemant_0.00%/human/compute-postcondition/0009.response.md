Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is an even integer (though `n` is not used in the print statement).
- `s` is a string '110110...110' repeated `n//2` times (where `n//2` is the number of repetitions).

The length of `s` is less than 200, but this does not affect the content of `s`.

Given that `s` is constructed by repeating '110' `n//2` times, the string `s` will look like '110110110...110' with a total length of `3 * (n//2)`.

Since `n` is an even integer, `n//2` will be an integer, and the string `s` will consist of the pattern '110' repeated that many times.

Therefore, the output will be the string `s` as described.

Output: **110110...110 (where the string is repeated n//2 times)**
