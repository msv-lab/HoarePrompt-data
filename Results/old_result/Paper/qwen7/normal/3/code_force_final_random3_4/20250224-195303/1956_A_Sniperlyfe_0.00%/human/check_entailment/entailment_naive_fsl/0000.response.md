Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the number of winners in the game. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not accurately simulate the process of kicking out players based on the sequence `p`.

Let's analyze the issue with an example:

### Example Analysis
Consider the following input:
- `k = 2`, `q = 1`
- `p = [3, 5]`
- `n = 5`

According to the problem description:
1. In the first round, the 3rd and 5th players are kicked out. Since the 5th player does not exist, only the 3rd player (C) is kicked out.
2. After the first round, the remaining players are A, B, and D.
3. In the second round, the 3rd player (D) is kicked out.
4. No more players are kicked out in the third round, so the game ends.

The winners should be players A and B, which means 2 players are declared as winners.

However, the function `func_1` does not correctly simulate this process. Let's see what `func_1` does with `n = 5` and `p = [3, 5]`:
```python
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))
    return n
```
When `n = 5` and `p = [3, 5]`:
1. `min(p) = 3`
2. `sum((1 for x in p if x <= 5)) = 2` (since both 3 and 5 are less than or equal to 5)
3. `n -= 2` → `n = 5 - 2 = 3`
4. `min(p) = 3`
5. `sum((1 for x in p if x <= 3)) = 1` (only 3 is less than or equal to 3)
6. `n -= 1` → `n = 3 - 1 = 2`
7. `min(p) = 3`
8. `sum((1 for x in p if x <= 2)) = 1` (only 3 is greater than 2)
9. `n -= 1` → `n = 2 - 1 = 1`

So, `func_1` returns `1`, which is incorrect because the correct number of winners should be `2`.

This discrepancy shows that the function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the game's logic, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
