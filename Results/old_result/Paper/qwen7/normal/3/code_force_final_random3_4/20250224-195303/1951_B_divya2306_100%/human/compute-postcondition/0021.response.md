Output State: `wins` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element from the input split into an integer, `i` is 3.

**Explanation**: The loop continues to increment the `wins` variable as long as the condition `a[i] > a[k - 1]` is not met. After the loop has executed 3 times, it means that `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` were all less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`. The loop will continue to execute until `a[i]` becomes greater than `a[k - 1]` or until `i` reaches `n`. Since the loop has already executed 3 times, `i` is now 3. If `a[3]` is not greater than `a[k - 1]`, then `wins` will still be 3 after all iterations of the loop.
