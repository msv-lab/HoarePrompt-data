Based on the initial state provided:

- `z` is the result of repeatedly adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to itself, starting from the initial value of `k - 2`, for a total of `x - k + 3` times.
- `a` is less than `z`.

The print statement is `print('NO')`.

Given this information, the print statement will simply output the string `'NO'`.
