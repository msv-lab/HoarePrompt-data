Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) representing the size of the array and Polycarp's favorite integers, followed by a list of n integers representing the elements of the array; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    count = 0
    residue_map = {}
    for num in arr:
        r_x = -num % x
        r_y = num % y
        count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
        current_key = num % x, num % y
        residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, which is the sum of all values obtained from `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each `num` in `arr`; `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key `(-num % x, num % y)` is mapped to its frequency (i.e., how many times it appears as a result of processing elements in `arr` through the loop); `current_key` is the last computed key `num % x, num % y` from the final iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` is a list containing `count`, `count` is the sum of all values obtained by `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each `num` in `arr`, `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(r_x, r_y)` and the value is the count of how many times that specific tuple has been encountered, `r_x` is `-num % x` for each `num` in `arr`, `r_y` is `num % y` for each `num` in `arr`, `current_key` is updated to `(num % x, num % y)` for each `num` in `arr`, and `num` is the last element processed in `arr` after all iterations of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `count` is the sum of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each `num` in `arr`, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y` for each iteration, `arr` is an empty list, `r_x` is `-num % x` for each `num` in `arr`, `r_y` is `num % y` for each `num` in `arr`, `residue_map` contains the count of each unique `(num % x, num % y)` pair in `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
