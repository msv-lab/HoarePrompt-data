Postcondition: `i` is 0, `left` is `S[0][0]`, `lsum` is 0, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n - i`, and the condition `(left * 2 >= lsum) and (right * 2 >= rsum)` still holds true. If the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
