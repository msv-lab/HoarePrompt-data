### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a card game where you and Nene take turns playing cards. Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (the number of cards you have) and `a` (a list of integers representing the numbers on your cards).
   - It uses `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each number in `a`.
   - It calculates the number of pairs of cards (`pairs`) that have exactly 2 occurrences.
   - It returns the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and the list of integers `a`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Since Nene always plays optimally, she will try to maximize her score and minimize yours.
   - To maximize your score, you should avoid giving Nene opportunities to score points by playing cards that she also has.
   - Specifically, you should aim to play cards that Nene does not have, thereby preventing her from scoring points.

5. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the number of pairs of cards that can be played.
   - However, it does not fully account for the optimal strategy of Nene.
   - Specifically, `func_1` only counts pairs and does not consider the optimal play of Nene.
   - The function should instead focus on ensuring that you do not play cards that Nene has, thereby preventing her from scoring points.

6. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - The logic in `func_2` is correct for reading and processing the input.
   - It correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.

7. **Revised Approach:**
   - Instead of counting pairs, you should focus on ensuring that you do not play cards that Nene has.
   - You can achieve this by counting how many unique numbers in your hand are not present in Nene's hand.
   - This ensures that you do not give Nene opportunities to score points.

### Revised Implementation:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1(n, a):
    # Count the occurrences of each number in your hand
    counter = Counter(a)
    
    # Calculate the number of unique numbers in your hand
    unique_numbers = len(counter)
    
    # Nene will always play optimally to minimize your score
    # So, you can score at most half of the unique numbers
    return min(unique_numbers, n // 2)

# Function 2 remains the same
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        results.append(func_1(n, a))
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

### Conclusion:

- The revised implementation of `func_1` correctly accounts for the optimal strategy of Nene by focusing on the number of unique numbers in your hand.
- The logic in `func_2` remains correct for reading and processing the input.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
