Postcondition: `d` is `k // 2`, `a` is a list of integers from the new input split, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input split, `b` is updated to a list of integers from the new input split, `len_a` is the length of list `a`, `len_b` is the length of list `b`, `count_a` is 1, `count_b` is either 3 or remains 2, `i` is less than `max(len_a, len_b)`, and `t` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1.
