Output State: **`vx` has at least 2 elements, the last but one element of `vx` is `v2`, the first element of `vx` is the new `v3`, and `_` is not used.**

Explanation: The code removes the first element of `vx`, which was previously stored in `v3`. After removal, `v3` now refers to the second element of the updated `vx`, and `v2` remains unchanged as it was the last but one element before the removal.
