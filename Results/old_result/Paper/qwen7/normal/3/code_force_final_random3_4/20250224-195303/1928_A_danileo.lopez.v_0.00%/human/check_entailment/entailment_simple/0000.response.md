Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the logic implemented matches the problem statement. Let's break down the problem and the provided solution:

### Problem Statement Recap:
- Bob starts with a rectangle of dimensions \(a \times b\).
- He can make a cut parallel to one of the sides, resulting in two smaller rectangles.
- He can then rearrange these two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle.
- Two rectangles are considered the same if they can be rotated to match each other.
- We need to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle from the original one.

### Key Observations:
1. **Cutting Parallel to Sides**: When cutting parallel to one side, the resulting rectangles will have one dimension equal to the original dimension and the other dimension halved (if the original dimension was even) or reduced by one (if the original dimension was odd).
2. **Forming New Rectangles**: To form a new rectangle, at least one of the resulting rectangles must have dimensions that allow forming a different rectangle when combined.

### Provided Solution Analysis:
- The program reads an integer \(t\) representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\) representing the dimensions of the rectangle.
- It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If so, it prints "Yes" because an even dimension allows for the formation of a new rectangle (e.g., a 4x3 rectangle can be split into 4x1 and 4x2, and recombined to form a 2x6 rectangle).
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it prints "No" because splitting an odd dimension results in two smaller odd dimensions, which cannot form a new rectangle without a change in the overall dimensions.

### Verification:
- **Case 1: Both Dimensions Even**
  - Example: \(4 \times 6\)
  - Cutting: \(4 \times 3\) and \(4 \times 3\)
  - Reformation: \(2 \times 6\)
  - Result: "Yes"
- **Case 2: One Dimension Even, One Dimension Odd**
  - Example: \(4 \times 5\)
  - Cutting: \(4 \times 2\) and \(4 \times 3\)
  - Reformation: \(2 \times 10\)
  - Result: "Yes"
- **Case 3: Both Dimensions Odd**
  - Example: \(3 \times 5\)
  - Cutting: \(3 \times 2\) and \(3 \times 3\)
  - Reformation: Not possible without changing dimensions
  - Result: "No"

Given the logic and examples, the program correctly implements the solution.

Correctness: **True**
