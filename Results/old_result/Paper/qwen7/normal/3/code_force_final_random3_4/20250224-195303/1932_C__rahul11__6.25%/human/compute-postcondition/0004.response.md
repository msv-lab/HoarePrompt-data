Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `m` is the second integer input split from the input string, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(input())` takes an input string, splits it into individual characters, and assigns these characters to the list `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
