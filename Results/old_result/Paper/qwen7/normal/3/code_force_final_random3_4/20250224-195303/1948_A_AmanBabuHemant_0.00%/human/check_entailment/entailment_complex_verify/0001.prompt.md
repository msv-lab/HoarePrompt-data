You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` must be equal to the initial value of `t`, `n` is the integer input from the user for each iteration, and `s` is a string consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times with a length of either less than 200 or exactly 200 for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` and `n`. For each test case, it checks if `n` is odd or even. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by `s`; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Checking Parity of `n`:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd.
   - If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because an odd number of special characters cannot be formed as per the problem constraints (a special character requires exactly one neighbor to be different).

3. **Generating the String:**
   - If `n` is even, the program generates a string `s` consisting of the pattern "110" repeated `(n // 2)` times.
   - This pattern ensures that every character except the first and last will have exactly one neighbor that is different, making them special.
   - The program then checks if the generated string `s` is less than 200 characters long.
     - If it is, it prints "YES" followed by the generated string `s`.
     - If it is not, it prints "NO".

### Issues with the Program

1. **Pattern Generation:**
   - The pattern "110" is used to generate the string, but this pattern does not ensure that all characters are special. For example, in "110", the first and third characters are special, but the second character is not.
   - The pattern needs to be adjusted to ensure that every character except the first and last has exactly one neighbor that is different.

2. **String Length Check:**
   - The check for the length of the string `s` is unnecessary because the problem guarantees that a solution exists for even `n` within the length constraint (up to 200).

### Correct Solution

A correct approach would be to use a repeating pattern like "AB" or "AC" to ensure that every character except the first and last is special.

### Revised Program

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Generate a string with alternating characters
            s = 'AB' * (n // 2)
            print('YES')
            print(s)

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program does not correctly solve the problem because it uses an incorrect pattern to generate the string. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
