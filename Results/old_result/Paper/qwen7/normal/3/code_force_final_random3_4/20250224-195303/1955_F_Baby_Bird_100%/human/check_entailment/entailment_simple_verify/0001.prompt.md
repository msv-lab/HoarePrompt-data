You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, there are four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
    #This is printed: the result of the calculation for each test case, separated by newlines (where the result for each test case is the sum of the processed counts divided by 3, formatted as a string)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all remaining numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Given Program:**
   ```python
   def func():
       print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
   ```

3. **Breaking Down the Program:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It then calculates a value using a specific formula and prints the result.

4. **Formula Analysis:**
   - The formula used is: 
     \[
     \text{sum} = \sum_{(i, x) \in \text{enumerate}(map(\text{int}, \text{input().split()}))} (3 \times (x // 2) + x \% 2 \times (i < 3))
     \]
   - This formula sums up values based on the count of each type of number:
     - For each 1, it adds \(3 \times (1 // 2) + 1 \% 2 \times (i < 3) = 0 + 1 \times 1 = 1\).
     - For each 2, it adds \(3 \times (2 // 2) + 2 \% 2 \times (i < 3) = 3 + 0 \times 1 = 3\).
     - For each 3, it adds \(3 \times (3 // 2) + 3 \% 2 \times (i < 3) = 4 + 1 \times 1 = 5\).
     - For each 4, it adds \(3 \times (4 // 2) + 4 \% 2 \times (i < 3) = 6 + 0 \times 1 = 6\).

5. **Dividing by 3:**
   - The final sum is divided by 3, which does not seem directly related to determining the maximum number of Bob's wins.

6. **Correctness Check:**
   - The formula provided does not align with the logic required to determine the maximum number of Bob's wins.
   - The problem requires understanding the bitwise XOR properties and optimal removal strategy, which is not captured by the given formula.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
