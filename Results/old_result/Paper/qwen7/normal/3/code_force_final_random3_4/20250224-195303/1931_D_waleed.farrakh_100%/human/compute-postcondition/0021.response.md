Output State: `test_cases` is a list containing five tuples \[(n, x, y, arr)\], `idx` is `idx + 10`, `t` is `t - 3`, where each tuple contains integers \(n\), \(x\), and \(y\) followed by a list of integers `arr` converted from `data[idx + 1].split()`. The loop has executed all its iterations, and `t` has been decremented by the total number of iterations, which is 5 in this case.
