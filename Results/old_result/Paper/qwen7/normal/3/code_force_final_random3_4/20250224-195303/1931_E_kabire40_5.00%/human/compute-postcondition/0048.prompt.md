Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `rev_val` is a sorted list of integers converted from the reversed strings of `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string does not match the original string's length.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `x` is an integer, `rev_res` is a string. If `x` is even (i.e., `x % 2 == 0`), then `x` is incremented by 1, `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[x]`, and `rev_res` is updated by appending the string representation of `val_in` to it. If `x` is odd, then `x` remains 0, `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[0]`, and `rev_res` is the reverse of `rev_val[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `x` is 3, and `rev_res` is a string. If `x % 2 == 0` is true, which it never is since `x` is 3, then `rev_res` remains unchanged as '3'. Otherwise, `rev_res` is updated by appending the reverse of `val_in[3]` to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `x` is 4, `rev_res` is either a string concatenated with '4' followed by '4', or the character at index 4 of `rev_res` followed by that character reversed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
