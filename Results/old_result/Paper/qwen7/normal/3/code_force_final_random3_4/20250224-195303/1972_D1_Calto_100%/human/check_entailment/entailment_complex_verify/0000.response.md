### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem statement to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - It is correctly implemented and works as expected.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is intended to solve the problem but has a flawed logic.
   - The function initializes `cnt` to -1 and then iterates from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(i\) in this range, it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
   - It updates `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.
   - The logic inside the loop does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotation for `func_2` suggests that `cnt` is updated in a way that does not reflect the problem requirements.
- The annotation mentions that `cnt` ends up being 20, with `i` being 5, `x` being `n - 27`, and `y` being 25. This is incorrect because the logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the required condition.

#### Correct Approach:
- To solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- We should use the GCD calculation from `func_1` to check the condition for each pair.

Given the flaws in the current implementation, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_2` does not accurately count the valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.

**Final: False**
