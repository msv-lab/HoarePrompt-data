Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1, `i` is equal to the length of `paths`, `k` is equal to the length of `paths`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the loop iterations, `ress` holds the final maximum value between all `curr` values, `pathb` contains all elements added until `vis[pb - 1] == 1`, `paths` is an empty list, `n` is an integer from the first input string, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop, `ps` is the same as before, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the first input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `vis[ps - 1]` is set to 1.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    paths.append(a[ps - 1])
    ps = p[ps - 1]
    if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vis` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `pb - 1` set to 1, `i` is equal to the length of `paths`, `k` is equal to the length of `paths`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the loop iterations, `ress` holds the final maximum value between all `curr` values, `pathb` contains all elements added until `vis[pb - 1] == 1`, `paths` now contains `a[ps - 1]`, `n` is an integer from the first input string, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the first input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `vis[ps - 1]` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `vis[ps - 1]` is set to 1, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, these changes occur regardless of the condition in the if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `vis[ps - 1]` is set to 1, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, and `paths` has appended `a[ps - 1]`. If `vis[ps - 1]` equals 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
