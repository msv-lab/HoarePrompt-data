Output State: **`i` is the first element of `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list that must have at least one element, and `ans` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `i`, `tmp`, or `ans`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are currently inside. Since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, the state of the variables remains as they were in the initial state.
