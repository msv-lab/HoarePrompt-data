Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases and then processing each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the program calculates the minimum number of tents required based on the given constraints.
3. The logic for calculating the number of tents is as follows:
   - Each introvert requires 1 tent, so `a` tents are needed for introverts.
   - Extroverts require 3 people per tent. The maximum number of complete tents that can be filled with extroverts and universals is `(b + c) // 3`. However, if there are leftover extroverts (`b % 3 != 0`) and the remaining people (`b % 3 + c < 3`) cannot form a complete tent, then it is impossible to accommodate everyone, and the program prints `-1`.
   - If the condition `b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3` is not met, the program calculates the number of additional tents needed for the remaining people after filling as many complete tents as possible.
4. The program correctly handles the edge cases and prints the appropriate result for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
