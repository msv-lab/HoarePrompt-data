Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner of the game. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is not used in the main logic and seems to be irrelevant to the game's rules. It sorts and modifies an array, but this does not help in determining the winner based on the game's rules.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to solve the problem recursively, but it does not correctly simulate the game's state or logic. Specifically:
   - The base cases for `n == 1` and `n == 2` are not correctly implemented.
   - The recursive call `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)` does not account for the fact that the game involves removing the same number of stones from all non-empty piles simultaneously.
   - The logic for determining the winner is flawed and does not correctly simulate the game's rules.

To correctly solve this problem, you should use the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). The player who faces a position with a Nim-sum of zero will lose if both players play optimally. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def nim_game_winner(piles):
    nim_sum = 0
    for pile in piles:
        nim_sum ^= pile
    return "Alice" if nim_sum else "Bob"

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    piles = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(nim_game_winner(piles))
```

This solution correctly computes the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and determines the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or not.
