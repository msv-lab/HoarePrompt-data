Based on the initial state provided:

- `a`, `b`, `c` are integers from input.
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `i` is `t-1`.

The `print('NONE')` statement simply prints the string `'NONE'`.

Since the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, and `i` do not affect the output of this specific print statement, the output will always be the same regardless of their values.

Output: **NONE**
