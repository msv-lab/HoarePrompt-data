Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is False.**

The variable `done` is assigned the boolean value `False`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the initial conditions for the other variables remain unchanged.
