Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers from the input.
   - This part is handled correctly with the list comprehension `[int(input()) for _ in range(t)]`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process each test case.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

3. **Loop Through Test Cases:**
   - For each test case `x`, it initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
   - It then iterates over all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to 1.
     - For each `y`, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using `math.gcd(x, y)`.
     - It computes the sum `current_sum` as `gcd_val + y`.
     - If this sum is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to `y`. The loop breaks early since we only need the first `y` that maximizes the sum.

4. **Result Collection:**
   - After processing each test case, the value of `best_y` is appended to the `results` list.
   - Finally, the function returns the `results` list.

5. **Output Handling:**
   - The main part of the program iterates over the `results` list and prints each element.

### Verification Against Problem Description:

- **Problem Requirement:** Find any integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
- **Program Logic:** The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for each test case \( x \).
- **Edge Cases:** 
  - When \( x = 2 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \(\gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2\). The program correctly outputs 1.
  - For larger values of \( x \), the program checks all possible \( y \) values and finds the one that maximizes the sum.
- **Output Format:** The program outputs the required format, printing one \( y \) per line for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the integer \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for each test case \( x \).

**Correctness: True**
