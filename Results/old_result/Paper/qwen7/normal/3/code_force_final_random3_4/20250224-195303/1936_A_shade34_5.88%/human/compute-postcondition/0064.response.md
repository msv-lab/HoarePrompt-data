Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is 0
- `i` is 1
- `len(pans)` must be at least 2

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

Let's break it down step by step:

1. `pans[mak]`: Since `mak` is 0, this refers to the first element of the list `pans`.
2. `pans[i]`: Since `i` is 1, this refers to the second element of the list `pans`.

Given that `len(pans)` is at least 2, we know there are at least two elements in the list `pans`. Let's denote these elements as `pans[0]` and `pans[1]`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
- `'?'` (as a string)
- `pans[0]` (the first element of the list `pans`)
- `pans[0]` (repeated)
- `pans[1]` (the second element of the list `pans`)
- `pans[1]` (repeated)

Output: **'? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]]'**
