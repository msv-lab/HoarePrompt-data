Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `mak` is either `i+1` or `i`, depending on whether the input is less than 0 (current value of the input is '<').
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` must be at least 2.

2. **Determine the Value of `mak`:**
   - Since `n` must be at least 2, `i` must be at least 1 initially (because `i` is incremented by 1).
   - If the input is not less than 0 (i.e., it is not '<'), then `mak` will be `i`.
   - If the input is less than 0 (i.e., it is '<'), then `mak` will be `i+1`.

3. **Determine the Value of `i`:**
   - After the condition is checked, `i` is incremented by 1.

Given these points, let's consider the possible scenarios:

- If the input is not less than 0 (i.e., it is not '<'):
  - `mak` will be `i`.
  - After incrementing `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

- If the input is less than 0 (i.e., it is '<'):
  - `mak` will be `i + 1`.
  - After incrementing `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

In both cases, after the increment, `i` becomes `i + 1`.

4. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print('?', mak, mak, i, i)`.
   - We need to determine the values of `mak` and `i` after the condition is evaluated and `i` is incremented.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we can only describe the values in terms of the initial state and the increment operation.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **'? [i] [i] [i+1] [i+1]** (where `[i]` is the initial value of `i` and `[i+1]` is the value of `i` after incrementing by 1).
