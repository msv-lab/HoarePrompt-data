Postcondition: `i` is 4, `t` must be greater than 4, `done` is False, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`. If `n` equals 1, the condition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition is the same as the precondition when `n` does not equal 1.
