Output State: **`h1` is an empty string, `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string, `h` is the input hour.**

Explanation: The code sets `time` to an empty string, changing its value from either 'AM' or 'PM' to an empty string. The other variables (`h1`, `m1`, and `h`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
