### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles into an array `arr`.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1(arr)` to determine the winner based on the game rules.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Step 1**: Convert the array `arr` to a set and sort it to get unique pile sizes in ascending order.
   - **Step 2**: Check if the smallest pile size is 1. If not, return "Alice" because Alice can immediately remove all stones in one turn.
   - **Step 3**: Iterate through the sorted unique pile sizes to check if the difference between consecutive pile sizes is exactly 1. If any difference is greater than 1, set `not_c` to `False`.
   - **Step 4**: Use a boolean variable `A` to toggle between `True` and `False` for each pile size. If `not_c` is `True`, toggle `A` one last time.
   - **Step 5**: Return "Alice" if `A` is `True`, otherwise return "Bob".

4. **Game Logic**:
   - The logic implemented in `func_1` is based on the Sprague-Grundy theorem, which states that for a Nim-like game with multiple piles, the Grundy number (or nimber) of a position is the minimum excludant (mex) of the Grundy numbers of the positions reachable from it.
   - For this specific game, the Grundy number of a pile of size `k` is `k % 2`. When all piles have the same Grundy number, the second player wins; otherwise, the first player wins.
   - The function correctly implements this logic by checking if the smallest pile size is 1 and then toggling a boolean flag based on the differences between pile sizes.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where the smallest pile size is not 1 by immediately returning "Alice".
   - The function also correctly handles cases where the differences between pile sizes are not consistent, ensuring the correct winner is determined.

However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the function `func_1`. The function does not correctly implement the Sprague-Grundy theorem for the given game. Specifically, the function does not account for the fact that the Grundy number of a pile of size `k` is `k % 2`, and it incorrectly toggles the boolean flag `A` based on the differences between consecutive pile sizes.

To correctly determine the winner, the function should compute the XOR of the Grundy numbers of all piles. If the result is 0, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

### Correct Implementation:
```python
def func_1(arr):
    grundy_numbers = [pile % 2 for pile in arr]
    xor_result = 0
    for grundy in grundy_numbers:
        xor_result ^= grundy
    return 'Alice' if xor_result else 'Bob'
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner based on the Sprague-Grundy theorem. The provided function does not correctly compute the Grundy numbers and their XOR.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
