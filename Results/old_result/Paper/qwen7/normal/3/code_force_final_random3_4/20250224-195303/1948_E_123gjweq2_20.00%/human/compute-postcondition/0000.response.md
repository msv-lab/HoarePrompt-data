Output State: **`left` is an integer such that `left` < `right`, `right` is an integer, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, and `small_element` is `left + 1`.**

This means that the value of `left` remains unchanged, `right` remains unchanged, `clique` remains unchanged, and `small_element` is now set to `left + 1`.
