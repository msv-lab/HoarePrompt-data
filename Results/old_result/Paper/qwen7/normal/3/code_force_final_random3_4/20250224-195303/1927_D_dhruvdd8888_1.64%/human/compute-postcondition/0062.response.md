Based on the initial state provided:

- `ppp` is explicitly given as 23.
- `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to a tuple using `map` and `int` functions. However, the actual values of `l` and `r` are not specified in the initial state.
- `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to keep the list `arr` sorted. This value is not specified in the initial state.
- `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from `arr[max(eli, LA)]`. Again, these values are not specified.
- The current value of `e` is greater than or equal to `r`.

The `print(-1, -1)` statement simply prints the values `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
