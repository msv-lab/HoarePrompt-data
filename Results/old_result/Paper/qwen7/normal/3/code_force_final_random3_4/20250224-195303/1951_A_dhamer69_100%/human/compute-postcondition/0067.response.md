Output State: **`t` is now `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string from the user, and `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. If `count_1 % 2 != 0`, the condition is not met. Otherwise, if `s.count('11') == 1 and count_1 == 2`, the condition is met; otherwise, the condition is not met.**

The code `t -= 1` decrements the value of `t` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `s`, and `count_1`) remain unchanged. The conditions related to these variables (specifically, the condition involving `count_1` and `s.count('11')`) also remain unchanged.
