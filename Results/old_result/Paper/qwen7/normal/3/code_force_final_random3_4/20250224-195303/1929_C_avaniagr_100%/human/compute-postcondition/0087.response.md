Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `z` will be the result of repeatedly adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to itself, starting from the initial value of `k - 2`, for a total of `x - k + 3` times.**

In simpler terms, `z` starts at `k - 2` and is incremented by `z // (k - 1) + 1` in each iteration of the loop, for a total of `x - k + 3` iterations. The final value of `z` will be the sum of its initial value and all the increments accumulated over these iterations.
