Output State: **Postcondition: `j` is 2, `lex` is a value less than or equal to 26, and `arr` contains the elements 1, 26, and 1 (since `lex` will be reduced to a value less than or equal to 25 after the first two iterations).**

Explanation: The loop runs twice based on the given range (`range(2)`). After each iteration, `lex` is reduced by 26 if it was greater than 26 initially, and by 1 if it was between 1 and 26. Since the loop runs twice, `lex` will be reduced by 52 in total, meaning it will be a value less than or equal to 26 after the last iteration. The list `arr` will contain the elements appended in each iteration, which are 1 and 26, and since `lex` will be reduced by 1 in the last iteration if it was between 1 and 26, the last element added to `arr` will be 1.
