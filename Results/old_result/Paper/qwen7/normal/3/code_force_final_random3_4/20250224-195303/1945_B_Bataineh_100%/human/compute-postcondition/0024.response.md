Given the initial state:
- `t` is a value greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers assigned from the input split into integers.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(2 + m // b)
```

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Values of Variables:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from input. Since their specific values are not provided, we cannot determine them precisely. However, we know they are integers.

2. **Expression Evaluation:**
   - The expression `2 + m // b` involves integer division (`//`), which returns the quotient of the division of `m` by `b` without the remainder.
   - The result of `m // b` is an integer.
   - Adding 2 to this integer result gives the final value to be printed.

Since the exact values of `m` and `b` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **2 + (m // b) (where m and b are integers obtained from input)**
