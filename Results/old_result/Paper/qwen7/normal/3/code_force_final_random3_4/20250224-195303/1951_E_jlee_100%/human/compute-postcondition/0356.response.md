Output State: **`s` is a string, `done` is True, `count` is `n-1`, `count2` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `i` is `t-1`, `string` is an input string**

Explanation: The code `string = input()` assigns the value entered by the user through the input function to the variable `string`. The other variables (`s`, `done`, `count`, `count2`, `j`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
