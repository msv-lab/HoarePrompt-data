Output State: **`i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all integers from `n` to `2n - 1` inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not modify any variables. It flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which means any pending print statements are immediately sent to the console. However, since there were no print statements before this line, and no variables are being modified, the values of `i` and `pans` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` is used to define the range of the list `pans` is also preserved.
