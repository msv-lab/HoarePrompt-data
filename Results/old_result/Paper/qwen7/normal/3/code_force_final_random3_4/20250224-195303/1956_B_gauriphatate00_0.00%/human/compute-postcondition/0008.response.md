Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is idx + 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`**.

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. The values of `data` and `n` remain unchanged. After the increment, `n` will be the integer value of `data[idx]` (where `idx` is now `idx + 1`).
