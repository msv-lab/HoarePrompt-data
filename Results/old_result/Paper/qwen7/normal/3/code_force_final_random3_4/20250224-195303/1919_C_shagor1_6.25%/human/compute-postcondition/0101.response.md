Output State: **`x` is equal to `y`, `a` is greater than `x`, and `a` is greater than `y`**.

Explanation: The line `x == y` checks if `x` is equal to `y`. Since the initial condition states that `(a > x)` and `(a > y)`, and now `x == y`, it means that both `x` and `y` have the same value, which satisfies the equality. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
