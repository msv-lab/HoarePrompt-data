Postcondition: **`shapes` is either 0 + (d[j] // 3) or 0, `d` is a dictionary where the count of each element in `palka` is stored, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered, and `j` is such that `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, but `j` will be the next element in `pl` that satisfies this condition and `pl` will be updated to exclude the current `j`.**
