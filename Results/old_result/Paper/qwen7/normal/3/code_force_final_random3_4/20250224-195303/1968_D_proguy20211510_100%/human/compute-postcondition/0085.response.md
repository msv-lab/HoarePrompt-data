Output State: **`i` is 2, `len(paths)` is known, `k` is 1, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the last valid `curr` value, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`**.

Explanation: The line `ress = max(ress, curr)` updates the value of `ress` to be the maximum between its current value and the value of `curr`. Since `curr` is defined as `pres + paths[1] * (1 - 0)`, which simplifies to `pres + paths[1]`, the value of `ress` is now updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `pres + paths[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
