Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `minn` is the smallest value of `same` encountered during the loop execution, `same` is 1, and `num` is the last element of `ar` if `ar[i-1]` is not equal to `num`, otherwise `same` could be any value from 1 to the maximum value of `same` encountered during the loop execution.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `ar`.
- The variable `minn` will hold the minimum value of `same` that was recorded during the loop.
- The variable `same` will be reset to 1 after the loop ends.
- The variable `num` will be the last element of `ar` if it was not equal to the previous `num` when the loop ended, otherwise, `same` can take any value from 1 to the maximum value of `same` observed during the loop.
