Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same, `minn` and `mex` will be updated based on the value of `arr[i + 1]`, `maxx` is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`.**

Explanation: The code updates `maxx` to be the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`. The values of `i`, `n`, `minn`, `mex`, and `arr` are not directly changed by this line of code, but `maxx` is now set to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. The state of `i` is advanced by 1, but since the exact value of `i` was not given, it is represented as `i + 1`. The other variables remain in their previous states.
