Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `l`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x` is `nums[1]`.
   - The postcondition states that if `nums[i]` (which is `nums[1]`) is less than `y` (which is also `nums[1]`), then no change is made to the variables.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < l`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2 in the next iteration.
   - The value of `x` will be `nums[2]` because the loop body assigns `x` to `nums[i]` each time it runs.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `x` will be `nums[2]`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 2, `x` is `nums[2]`**
