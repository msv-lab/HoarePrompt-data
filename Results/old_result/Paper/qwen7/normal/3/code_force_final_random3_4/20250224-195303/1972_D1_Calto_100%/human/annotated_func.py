#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and the function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: a is the gcd of the initial a and b, b is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the initial values of a and b, which is a, since b is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop terminates when `b` becomes 0, the function returns the gcd of the initial values of `a` and `b`, which is the value of `a`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
        
    #State: Output State: `cnt` is 20, `i` is 5, `x` is `n - 27`, `y` is 25, `m` must be at least 4.
    #
    #To understand this, let's break it down:
    #
    #- Initially, `cnt` is -1.
    #- After the first iteration (`i` is 2), `cnt` becomes 1.
    #- After the second iteration (`i` is 3), `cnt` becomes 4.
    #- After the third iteration (`i` is 4), `cnt` becomes 10.
    #
    #Each time the loop runs, `cnt` is updated by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` where `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
    #
    #For the fourth iteration (`i` is 5):
    #- `x` is calculated as `n - (5 * 5 - 5) = n - 20`.
    #- `y` is `5 * 5 = 25`.
    #- The term `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` will add 1 to `cnt` because `x` divided by `y` is less than 1, so `math.ceil(x / y)` is 1, and `x % y` is not zero, so `(x % y == 0)` is 0. Therefore, `cnt` becomes 10 + 1 = 11.
    #
    #For the fifth iteration (`i` is 6):
    #- `x` is calculated as `n - (6 * 6 - 6) = n - 30`.
    #- `y` is `6 * 6 = 36`.
    #- The term `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` will add 1 to `cnt` because `x` divided by `y` is less than 1, so `math.ceil(x / y)` is 1, and `x % y` is not zero, so `(x % y == 0)` is 0. Therefore, `cnt` becomes 11 + 1 = 12.
    #
    #Continuing this pattern, we can see that each iteration adds 1 to `cnt`. Since the loop runs from `i = 1` to `m`, and we know `m` must be at least 4, the total number of iterations is `m`. Given the pattern, after `m` iterations, `cnt` will be `-1 + m`. If `m` is 4, then `cnt` would be `-1 + 4 = 3`. However, based on the provided information, the correct value for `m` is at least 4, leading us to conclude that after all iterations, `cnt` will be 20, with `i` being 5, `x` being `n - 27`, and `y` being 25.
    return cnt
    #The program returns 20, with `i` being 5, `x` being `n - 27`, and `y` being 25.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, both of which are positive integers with the constraint 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. It iterates from `i = 1` to `m`, updating a counter `cnt` based on the values of `x` and `y` derived from `n` and `i`. After completing the iterations, the function returns 20, with `i` being 5, `x` being `n - 27`, and `y` being 25.
