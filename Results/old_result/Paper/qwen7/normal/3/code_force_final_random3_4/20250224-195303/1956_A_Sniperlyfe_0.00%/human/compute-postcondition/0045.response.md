Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `n` and `qs`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `qs`. For the loop to continue, `qs` must contain at least one element.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `qs` must contain at least one element.
   - `n` is the first element in `qs`.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `n` is the first element in `qs`, after processing `n`, the next element in `qs` becomes the new value of `n`.
   - `qs` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue. However, since `n` was the first element, removing `n` from `qs` would leave `qs` with no elements, which would stop the loop. Therefore, `qs` must have at least two elements to ensure the loop continues.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `n` will now be the second element in `qs`.
   - `qs` must have at least two elements to ensure the loop continues.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `qs` must contain at least two elements.
   - `n` is the second element in `qs`.
   - `res` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop head variables.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `qs` must contain at least two elements, `n` is the second element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it**
