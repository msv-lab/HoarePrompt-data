Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + n`, `n` is `int(data[idx])`, `a` is a list of integers created by mapping `int` over the slice of `data` from `idx` to `idx + n`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a)`, `t` is `t - 1 and must be greater than 1**.

Explanation: The code `idx += n` increments the value of `idx` by `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The updated value of `idx` is now `idx + n`. The value of `n` remains as `int(data[idx])`, and `a` and `results` retain their previously defined states. The condition for `t` is also maintained as `t - 1 and must be greater than 1`.
