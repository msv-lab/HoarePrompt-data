Postcondition: **The loop has executed all iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to `n-1`. The value of `possible` is True. If at any point during the loop execution, the condition `c[i] != a[i]` was met without `c[i]` being equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` would be set to True and the loop would break. If the loop completes without setting `possible` to True, it remains False.**
