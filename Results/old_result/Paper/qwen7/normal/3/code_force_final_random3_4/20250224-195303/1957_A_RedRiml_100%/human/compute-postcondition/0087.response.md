Output State: **`d` is a dictionary and `pl` now contains the next element of `i`, which is the next element in `palka`. If `i` was not previously a key in `d`, its value is set to 1. If `i` was already a key in `d`, its value is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `pl`. The dictionary `d` remains unchanged in terms of its structure and values unless `i` was a key in `d`, in which case its value would be incremented. The initial conditions about `d` and `pl` remain valid, and `pl` now includes the next element of `i`.
