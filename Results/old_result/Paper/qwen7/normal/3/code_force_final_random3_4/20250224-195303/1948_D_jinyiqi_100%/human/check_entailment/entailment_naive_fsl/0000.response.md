Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the string consists entirely of question marks. For example, consider the input `?????`. The program should output `4` because we can replace the question marks to form the string `aaaaa`, which has a tandem repeat substring of length `4` (`aa` repeated twice). However, the current implementation will output `0` because it does not attempt to form any tandem repeat substrings.

To fix this, the program needs to check if it's possible to form a tandem repeat by replacing question marks and then attempt to do so. Here is a modified version of the function that should work correctly:

```python
def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    max_length = 0
    
    # Try to form a tandem repeat by replacing question marks
    for i in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        for j in range(0, n - i):
            valid = True
            for k in range(j, j + i):
                if s[k] != '?' and s[k + i] != '?' and s[k] != s[k + i]:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                max_length = max(max_length, i * 2)
    
    print(max_length)

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()
```

This version of the function tries to form tandem repeats by checking each possible length and ensuring that the characters match or are question marks. It updates `max_length` if a valid tandem repeat is found.
