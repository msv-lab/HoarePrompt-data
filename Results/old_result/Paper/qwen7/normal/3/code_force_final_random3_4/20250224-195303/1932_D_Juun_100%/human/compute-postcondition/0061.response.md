Output State: **`rank` remains unchanged, `suit` is the next key in the `suits` dictionary, `trumps` is a list with one element less than before and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, it does not change the values of the variables `rank`, `suit`, or `trumps`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states, and the loop continues.
