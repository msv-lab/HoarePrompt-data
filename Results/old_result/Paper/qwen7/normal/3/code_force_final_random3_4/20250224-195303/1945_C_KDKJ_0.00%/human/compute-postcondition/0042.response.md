Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `S`, `left` is `S[0][0]`, `lsum` is `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`, and the condition `(left * 2 >= lsum) and (right * 2 >= rsum)` holds true. The absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`.
