The function processes an array of integers `a` for multiple test cases. For each test case, it first checks if the array is "beautiful" (i.e., all elements are the same). If the array is not beautiful, it finds the length of the longest sequence of consecutive elements that are different from the most frequent element in the array. If the array is beautiful, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the length of the longest sequence of non-matching consecutive elements.
