Postcondition: **`k` is an integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` remains unchanged, `i` equals `2x + 1` if `x == k - 1`, otherwise `i` equals `x`, `z` equals `3 * (z + z // (k - 1) + 1)` if `x == k - 1`, otherwise `z` equals `x + 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` remains unchanged. If `a` is less than `z`, then `a` is updated to `z` and `z` is updated as described.**
