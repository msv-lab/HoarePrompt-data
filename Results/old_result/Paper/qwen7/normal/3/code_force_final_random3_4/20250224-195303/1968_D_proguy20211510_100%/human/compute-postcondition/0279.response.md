Output State: **`i` is equal to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `i` is incremented by 1, meaning `i` was 1 before the increment. The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are inside, but it does not change the value of `i`. Therefore, `i` remains 2, and we know that the execution was broken out of the loop or conditional statement.
