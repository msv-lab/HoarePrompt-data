The loop condition is `trumps != []`, which means the loop continues as long as the `trumps` list is not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, the `trumps` list is sorted in descending order and must not be empty.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the `trumps` list must still be non-empty. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the `trumps` list since it already meets the condition of being non-empty.

State: **The `trumps` list is sorted in descending order and must not be empty**
