Output State: `arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is calculated as follows: starting from `ans[n-2]` which is `10^9 - arr[n-2]`, each subsequent element `ans[i]` (where i ranges from n-3 to 0) is updated to `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`, `i` is now -1.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be -1, and each element in `ans` will have been updated according to the formula given by the loop, starting from `ans[n-2]` down to `ans[0]`.
