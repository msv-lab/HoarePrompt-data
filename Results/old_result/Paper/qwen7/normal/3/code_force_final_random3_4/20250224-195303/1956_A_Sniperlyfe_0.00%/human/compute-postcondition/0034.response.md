Output State: **`k` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `q` is the second integer input converted to an integer, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers with all elements processed, `n` is the last element in `qs` that was used in the loop, `k` is updated to the first integer input, and `q` is updated to the second integer input.**

This output state reflects that the values of `k` and `q` have been updated to the first and second integers inputted respectively, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
