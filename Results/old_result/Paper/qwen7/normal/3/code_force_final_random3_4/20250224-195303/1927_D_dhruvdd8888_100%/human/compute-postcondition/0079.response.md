Output State: **`input_value` must be a positive integer, `l` is the first integer from the new input split by space and converted to int, `r` is the second integer from the new input split by space and converted to int, `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`, `s` is the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`, `arr` is a sorted list, and `l` and `r` are now the integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` reads two integers from the input, splits them by space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `l` and `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
