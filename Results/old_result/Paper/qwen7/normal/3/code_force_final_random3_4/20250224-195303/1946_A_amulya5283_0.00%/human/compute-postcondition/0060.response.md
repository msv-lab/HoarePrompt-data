Output State: **`arr` is sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2] - 1`; `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[n // 2 + 1]` to the end of `arr` with the smallest element incremented by 1 and the smallest element is now the previous smallest element plus 1; `operations` is 2; `smallest` is the smallest element from the heap before it was popped.**

Explanation: The code pops the smallest element from the heap, which is a heap data structure starting from `arr[n // 2 + 1]` to the end of `arr`. After popping, the smallest element in the heap is incremented by 1. The `operations` count is decremented by 1 since one operation has been performed. The `smallest` variable is assigned the value of the popped element. All other variables remain unchanged.
