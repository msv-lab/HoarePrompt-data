Reasoning:
1. The function correctly handles the input format and number of test cases.
2. It checks if the last two characters of the second row (`b`) allow for movement to the last column. This is a necessary condition but not sufficient on its own.
3. The function then iterates through the even-indexed positions of both rows to check if there's a path from the first row to the second row by ensuring that the arrows point towards the second row.
4. However, the function has some logical issues:
   - The condition `if b[-2] != '>'` is not sufficient to determine if a path exists. It only checks the last two characters of the second row, which might not cover all scenarios where a path could exist.
   - The logic for checking the path through the even-indexed positions is flawed. It incorrectly sets `no_path` to `True` and then negates it based on the conditions, which does not accurately reflect the path existence.
5. The function should ensure that there is a continuous path from the first row to the second row by validating the direction of arrows in a more comprehensive manner.

Given these observations, the function does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

Correctness: **False**
