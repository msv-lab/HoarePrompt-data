Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is decreased by 3, but the exact value of `c` is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `j` is explicitly stated to be 3.
- `n` is greater than 2, but its exact value is not required for the output.
- `cntl[2]` is less than 2, but this value is not needed to determine the output.

The print statement is simply `print(j)`, which will print the value of `j`.

Output: **3**
