Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(mid)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `cliquess[left + i]` is set to `clique`.
   - `arr[left + i]` is set to `small_element + i`.
   - `left` and `i` retain their original values.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < mid`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < mid`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - `mid` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `cliquess[left + i]` and `arr[left + i]` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.
   - However, since we are only asked to update the state for the loop to execute one more time, we focus on the loop variables.

Given this reasoning, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`cliquess[left + (i + 1)]` is set to `clique`, `arr[left + (i + 1)]` is set to `small_element + (i + 1)`, `left` and `i` retain their original values, and `i` is incremented by 1.**

However, since we are only asked to provide the state at the start of the next iteration, we can simplify it to:

State: **`cliquess[left + (i + 1)]` is set to `clique`, `arr[left + (i + 1)]` is set to `small_element + (i + 1)`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

To fit the exact format requested:

State: **`cliquess[left + (i + 1)]` is set to `clique`, `arr[left + (i + 1)]` is set to `small_element + (i + 1)`, `i` is `i + 1`**
