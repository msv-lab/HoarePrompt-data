Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `num` which is taken from the list `arr`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `arr` must contain at least one element.
   - The value of `num` changes with each iteration.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`
   - `count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`
   - `arr` must contain at least one element
   - `r_x` is `-num % x`
   - `r_y` is `num % y`
   - `residue_map[current_key]` is the value of `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is the variable being iterated over, it will change to the next element in `arr`.
   - `current_key` will be updated based on the new `num`.
   - `r_x` and `r_y` will be updated based on the new `num`.
   - `residue_map[current_key]` will be incremented by 1 for the new `current_key`.

5. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `arr` must still contain at least one element.
   - `num` will be the next element in `arr`.
   - `current_key` will be `(num % x, num % y)`.
   - `r_x` will be `-num % x`.
   - `r_y` will be `num % y`.
   - `residue_map[current_key]` will be the value of `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `num` is the next element in `arr`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `residue_map[current_key]` is the value of `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`**
