Output State: **`ppp` is 23, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to a tuple using map and int functions, `eli` is the index where (l, 0, 0) would be inserted to keep the list `arr` sorted.**

Explanation: The code `eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))` finds the index in the sorted list `arr` where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. The values of `ppp`, `l`, `r`, and `tc` remain unchanged from the initial state. The new variable `eli` is introduced and holds the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be placed in `arr`.
