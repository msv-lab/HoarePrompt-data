Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `buffer` is a list of integers from the input, `w` is a list of integers from the input, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `q` with length `n + 1`, where each element is set to 0. Since `n` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a variable that will be determined later. However, based on the given initial state, `n` is derived from the context of the input lists `buffer` and `w`. The values of `t`, `i`, `buffer`, and `w` remain unchanged.
