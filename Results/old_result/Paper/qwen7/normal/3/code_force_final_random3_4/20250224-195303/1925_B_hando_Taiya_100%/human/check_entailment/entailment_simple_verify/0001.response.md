### Reasoning:

Upon reviewing the original assessment, I found that the primary issue identified was the non-use of the `func_1()` function within the main loop. However, the annotated code and the corrected program provided in the original assessment show that the function `func_1()` is indeed being used correctly within the main loop. Therefore, the original assessment incorrectly identified the program as incorrect due to the absence of a function call, which is not actually necessary in this context.

The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`, which computes the maximum balance as described. The logic inside `func_1()` is also correct for finding the maximum balance. The annotated code provides a clear explanation of how the function works and the state transitions.

Given that the original assessment incorrectly flagged the program as incorrect due to the non-call of `func_1()`, and the provided corrected program shows that the function is used correctly, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided annotations.
