Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`, `res` is incremented by 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers.**

Explanation: The line `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `t` is `t - 1`, `n` remains an input integer, `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`, and `res` is incremented by 1. The list `a` remains a sorted list of integers.
