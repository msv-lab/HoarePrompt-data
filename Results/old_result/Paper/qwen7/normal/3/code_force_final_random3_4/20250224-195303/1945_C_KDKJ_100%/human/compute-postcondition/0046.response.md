Output State: **`i` is `i + 1 + 1`, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (i + 1 + 1)`, and `ans` is either 0 or the value that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, ensuring that the condition `(left * 2 >= lsum) and (right * 2 >= rsum)` still holds true.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `right` from `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]` to `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is `i + 1 + 1`, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is updated to `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (i + 1 + 1)`, and `ans` is still either 0 or the value that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, ensuring that the condition `(left * 2 >= lsum) and (right * 2 >= rsum)` still holds true.
