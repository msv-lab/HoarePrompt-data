Reasoning:
- The program should handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.
- The annotated program shows that the main loop correctly reads the number of test cases (`kreker`) and then calls `func_1()` for each test case.
- Inside `func_1()`, the program reads two integers `n` and `m` for each test case and checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative.
- If the condition `((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0)` is satisfied, it prints "Yes".
- Otherwise, it prints "No".
- The logic inside `func_1()` matches the requirements of the problem statement accurately.
- There is no mention of any other functionality outside the loop, which means the program only processes the input as required and outputs the correct results based on the given conditions.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
