Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_diff` is the maximum difference found in the entire array A; `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference or -inf if no such difference exists; `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred or None if no valid index was found; `i` is n; `diff` is `A[n-2] - A[n-3]; `left` is `A[index - 1]`; `right` is `A[index]; `ans` is `max_diff`.
Code of the loop:
for f in F:
    l = bisect_right(D, left - f)
    h = bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1
    while l < h:
        mid = l + (h - l) // 2
        mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
        if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            h = mid
    if l == h:
        ans = min(ans, max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop finishes executing, `l` and `h` will define a range in the list `D` where `D[l] + f < left` and `D[h] + f >= right`, with `l` being the last index satisfying the first condition and `h` being the first index satisfying the second condition. Additionally, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` when `l` equals `h`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `l` is equal to `h`, `mid` is the midpoint between `l` and `h` during the last iteration, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f). All other variables (`mid`, `h`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `total`, `students`, `left`, `right`, `f`, `D[l]`) retain their previous values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
