Functionality: **The function processes the number of 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 application icons (represented by `x` and `y` respectively) and calculates the total number of rows needed to arrange these icons. It prints the result based on the given conditions. If both `x` and `y` are positive, it adjusts `x` according to specific rules and calculates the total rows. If only `y` is positive, it calculates the rows based on `y`. If only `x` is positive, it calculates the rows based on `x`. If neither `x` nor `y` is positive, it prints 0.**
