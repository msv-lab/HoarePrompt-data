Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `tmp` is a sorted list that must have at least one element, and `ans` is `ans + i`, `y` is equal to `y - (i - 1)`**.

This means that the value of `y` has been decreased by `i - 1`. All other variables retain their initial conditions or relationships as specified in the initial state.
