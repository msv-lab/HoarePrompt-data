Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the logic for determining the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the cost of bribing multiple people between Kirill's current position and his desired position. 

Consider the following example:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 2
  7 3 6 9
  4 3 8 5
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  14
  ```

However, the program outputs `10` instead of `14`. Hereâ€™s why:

- Kirill starts at position 4 (last position).
- To move to position 2, he needs to bribe the person at position 3, which costs `6` coins.
- To move from position 3 to position 2, he needs to bribe the person at position 2, which costs `3` coins.
- Total cost should be `6 + 3 + 5 = 14`.

The program incorrectly calculates the total cost by not properly accumulating the costs for bribing intermediate positions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
