Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and `m` is an integer.**

The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial state of `t` and `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), and `i` is still 1. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are now specific integers obtained from the input.
