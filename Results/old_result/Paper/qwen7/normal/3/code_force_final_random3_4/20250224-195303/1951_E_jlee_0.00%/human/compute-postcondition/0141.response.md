Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range((n + 1) // 2):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postconditions are:
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` is 2
   - `done` is set to True (though this variable is not part of the loop head)

3. **Check the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j < (n + 1) // 2`. Given `n` is 2, `(n + 1) // 2` evaluates to 1. Therefore, `j` must be less than 1 for the loop to continue.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**: Since `j` is currently 1, it is not less than 1. Therefore, the loop will not execute again.

5. **Adjust the states**: The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`. Since `j` cannot be updated within the loop head to satisfy the condition for another iteration, and `n` is not part of the loop condition, no adjustments are needed for these variables.

6. **Consider the postcondition**: The postcondition `done` being set to True does not affect the loop condition directly, so it remains unchanged.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration (which will not occur because the loop condition is not met) would remain the same as the current state.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`j` is 1, `n` is 2, and `done` is set to True**
