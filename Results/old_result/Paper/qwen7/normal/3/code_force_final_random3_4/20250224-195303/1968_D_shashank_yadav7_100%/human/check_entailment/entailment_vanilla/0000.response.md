Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` (Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Starting Positions:**
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert them to 0-based indices.

3. **Initial Scores Calculation:**
   - The initial scores for Bodya (`bp`) and Sasha (`sp`) are set to the values at their starting positions.
   - The maximum possible scores for Bodya (`bm`) and Sasha (`sm`) are initially set to the product of their starting scores and the number of turns `k`.

4. **Simulating Moves:**
   - A loop runs up to `k` times, simulating each turn.
   - In each iteration, the positions of Bodya and Sasha are updated to their new positions using the permutation `p`.
   - The scores are updated accordingly.
   - The maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha are updated based on the best possible moves they could make in the remaining turns.

5. **Determining the Winner:**
   - After the loop, the program compares the final maximum scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - If Bodya's maximum score is greater, it prints 'Bodya'.
   - If Sasha's maximum score is greater, it prints 'Sasha'.
   - If both scores are equal, it prints 'Draw'.

### Verification:

1. **Correctness of Initial Scores:**
   - The initial scores are correctly calculated as the value at the starting positions.

2. **Updating Scores:**
   - The scores are updated correctly by adding the value at the new position in each turn.

3. **Updating Maximum Possible Scores:**
   - The maximum possible scores are correctly updated by considering the best possible moves in the remaining turns.

4. **Handling Remaining Turns:**
   - The loop correctly handles the remaining turns and updates the scores and maximum possible scores.

5. **Final Comparison:**
   - The final comparison between the maximum possible scores is done correctly.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic implemented in the function is correct according to the problem statement. The program correctly simulates the game and determines the winner based on the given rules.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
