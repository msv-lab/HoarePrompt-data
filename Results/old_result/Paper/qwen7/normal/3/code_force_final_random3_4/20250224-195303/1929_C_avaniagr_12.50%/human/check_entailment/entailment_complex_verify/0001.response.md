### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Conditions for Winning**:
   - The program checks the conditions for Sasha to win based on the values of `k` and `x`:
     - If `x < k - 1`: This condition is incorrect. The program should check if Sasha can recover from losing up to `x` times in a row without needing more than `x + 1` coins initially. However, the logic in the program is flawed because it only checks if `a >= x + 1` and does not consider the recovery strategy.
     - If `x == k - 1`: This condition is also incorrect. The program should check if Sasha can recover from losing up to `x` times in a row without needing more than `x + 3` coins initially. However, the logic in the program is flawed because it only checks if `a >= x + 3` and does not consider the recovery strategy.
     - If `x > k - 1`: This condition is correct. The program calculates the minimum number of coins needed (`z`) using a loop that simulates the worst-case scenario of losing `x + 1` times in a row and then winning. The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` ensures that Sasha can recover from the worst-case scenario of losing `x + 1` times in a row and then winning. However, the logic in the program is flawed because it does not correctly handle the recovery strategy for `x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1`.

3. **Calculation of `z`**:
   - The loop in the program calculates the minimum number of coins needed to recover from losing `x + 1` times in a row and then winning. The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is correct for calculating the minimum number of coins needed for the worst-case scenario.
   - However, the program does not correctly handle the recovery strategy for `x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' if Sasha can guarantee winning and 'NO' otherwise. However, the logic for determining if Sasha can guarantee winning is flawed because it does not correctly handle the recovery strategy for `x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1`.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if Sasha can guarantee winning based on the given constraints. The calculations and conditions are not correctly applied, and the output does not match the expected results in the provided examples.

### Correctness:

**False**
