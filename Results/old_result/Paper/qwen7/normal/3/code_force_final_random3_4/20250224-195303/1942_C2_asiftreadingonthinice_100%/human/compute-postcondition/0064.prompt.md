Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After executing the if-else block, `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 1`, `ans` will be incremented by 1 each time the difference between consecutive elements in the list `a` is exactly 2, `tmp` will contain the half of the difference between consecutive elements in `a` whenever this difference is even but not 2, and `tmp` will also include the value of `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` if the condition `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2)` is true. The `tmp` list is sorted.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is either `len(a) - 2` or `len(a) - 1`, `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list, `ans` is updated to `ans + (len(a) - 1)` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, and `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the next element in `tmp` after `i_end`, `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list, `ans` is increased by `i` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, otherwise, `y` is decreased by `i - 1` and `i` is updated accordingly.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the next element in `tmp` after `i_end`, `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list, and either `ans` is increased by `i` and `y` is decreased by `i - 1`, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
