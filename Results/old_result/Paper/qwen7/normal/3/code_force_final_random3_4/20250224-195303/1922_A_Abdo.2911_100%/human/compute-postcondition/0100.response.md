Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is `t + 1`; `possible` is True**

Explanation: The variable `possible` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of `i` or `n`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `possible` and retains the initial values of `i` and `n`.
