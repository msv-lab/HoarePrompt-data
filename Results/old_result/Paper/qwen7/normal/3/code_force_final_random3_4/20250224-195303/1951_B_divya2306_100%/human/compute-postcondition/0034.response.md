Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `win_with_swap`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `win_with_swap` to `k - 1`. For the loop to continue, `i` (which starts at `win_with_swap`) must be less than `k - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `win_with_swap`.
   - `win_with_swap` is equal to `win_with_swap + 1`.
   - `win_with_swap` must be less than `k - 1`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts at `win_with_swap` and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `win_with_swap`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `k - 1`.
   - Given that `win_with_swap` is equal to `win_with_swap + 1`, the new value of `win_with_swap` is the value it had before the increment plus 1.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `win_with_swap + 1`.
   - `win_with_swap` will be updated to `win_with_swap + 1`.
   - `win_with_swap` must still be less than `k - 1` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `win_with_swap + 1`, `win_with_swap` is `win_with_swap + 1`, `win_with_swap` must be less than `k - 1`**.
