Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for result in results:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `result` and `results`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in the `results` list. At the end of the previous iteration, it is stated that `results` must contain at least one element.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one element. Since the loop is iterating over each element in `results`, after one iteration, `results` will have at least one less element than before.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `results` must still contain at least one element, but since one element has been processed, it now contains at least zero elements.
   - `result` will be the next element in the `results` list.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `results` now contains at least zero elements (since one element has been processed) and `result` will be the next element in the list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`results` must contain at least zero elements, and `result` will be the next element in the list**.
