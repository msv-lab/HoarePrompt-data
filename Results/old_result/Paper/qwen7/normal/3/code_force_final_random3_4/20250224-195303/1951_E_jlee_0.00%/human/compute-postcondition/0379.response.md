Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is the length of the input string `s`, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is False, `count` is 3, `count2` is 0, `i` is 4, `x` is `s[0]`, and we continue the loop if `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. The condition for continuing the loop also remains the same.
