The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of a string `s` of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it checks if the string can be divided into two parts such that the first part is the reverse of the second part, or if the string has a single character that appears exactly once or almost exactly once. If such a division or condition is found, it prints 'YES' along with the required information; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
