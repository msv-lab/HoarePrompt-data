The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and processes it to determine whether the first unique element is 1 and checks the gaps between consecutive unique elements. If the first unique element is not 1 or if any gap between consecutive unique elements is greater than 1, the function returns 'Alice'. Otherwise, it alternates the boolean value of `A` and returns 'Bob' based on the final value of `A`.
