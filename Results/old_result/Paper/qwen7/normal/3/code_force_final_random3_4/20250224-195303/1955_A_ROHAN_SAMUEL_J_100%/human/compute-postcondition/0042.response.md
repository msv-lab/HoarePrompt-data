Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers t, n, and a, and b indirectly through the constraints given. It returns a value based on specific conditions where t is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers within the ranges 1 to 100 and 1 to 30, respectively.**

This means the function indirectly accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, all constrained as specified, and returns a value determined by the conditions provided.
