Output State: **`arr` is sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2] - 1`; `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[n // 2 + 1]` to the end of `arr` with the smallest element incremented by 1 and the smallest element is now the previous smallest element plus 1; `operations` is 4; `smallest` is the smallest element from the heap before it was popped and incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `operations += 1` increments the value of `operations` by 1. Since `operations` was initially 3, after executing this line, `operations` becomes 4. The other variables (`arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `heap`, and `smallest`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
