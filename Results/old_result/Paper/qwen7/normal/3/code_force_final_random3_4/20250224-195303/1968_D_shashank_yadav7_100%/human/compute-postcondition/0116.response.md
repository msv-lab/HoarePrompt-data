Output State: **`k` is an input integer, `s` is `p[s] - 3`, `n` is an input integer, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -2 + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -2 + sp`, `sp` is now equal to `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b] + a[b]`, `b` is `p[b] - 2`, `s` is `p[s] - 3`, `b` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `bp` is updated to `a[b]`.**

Explanation:
- The line `bp = a[b]` updates the value of `bp` to be equal to the value of `a[b]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state or their previous values.
