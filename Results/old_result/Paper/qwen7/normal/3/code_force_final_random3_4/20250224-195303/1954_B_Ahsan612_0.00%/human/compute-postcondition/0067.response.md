Output State: **`i` is 5, `same` is 4 if `ar[4]` equals `num`, otherwise `same` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `same` is incremented by 1. Initially, `same` is 3 if `ar[4]` equals `num`, or 1 otherwise. After executing `same += 1`, `same` will be 4 if `ar[4]` equals `num`, or 2 otherwise. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
