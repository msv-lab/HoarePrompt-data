### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Digits**: For each test case, it correctly reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIRS' if this condition is met. This is correct according to the problem statement.
4. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met. This is also correct according to the problem statement.
5. **Default Case**: If neither condition is met, the program prints 'NONE'. This handles all other cases correctly.

Given that the program follows the conditions specified in the problem exactly, it should work correctly for all valid inputs as described.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description.
