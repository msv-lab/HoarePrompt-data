Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list `ar` and is now the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `i` is `i + 1` and is less than `len(ar) - 1`, `num` is the value of `ar[i]`**.

Explanation: The variable `same` is reassigned to 1, overriding its previous value which was either 2 or 3. All other variables remain unchanged with their previous states.
