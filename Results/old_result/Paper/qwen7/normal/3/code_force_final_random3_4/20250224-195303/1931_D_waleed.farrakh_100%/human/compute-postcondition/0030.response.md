Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter t, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. For each test case, it accepts three integers n, x, and y, where n ranges from 2 to 2Â·10^5 and x and y range from 1 to 10^9. Additionally, it accepts a list arr consisting of n integers, each ranging from 1 to 10^9. The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the specified conditions.**

Given the output cases are not explicitly stated, the function likely processes the list arr and the integers n, x, and y according to some logic related to the constraints provided. However, without explicit output cases, the focus remains on the input parameters and their constraints.
