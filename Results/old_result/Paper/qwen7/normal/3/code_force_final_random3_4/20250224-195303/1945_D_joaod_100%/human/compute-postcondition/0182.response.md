Output State: **`best` is compared with `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` remains unchanged, otherwise `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` remains unchanged.**

This means that the value of `total` has been increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `best` has been updated according to the condition given. The values of `best`, `total`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` are now as described.
