Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters). For each test case, it performs some unspecified operations and returns different values based on the input.**

Note: The exact operations and return values are not specified in the given information, so the functionality description focuses on the structure and nature of the input and implied processing.
