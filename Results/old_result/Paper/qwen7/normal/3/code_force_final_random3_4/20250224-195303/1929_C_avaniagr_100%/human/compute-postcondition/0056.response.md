Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the next line `s`, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to `k - 3`, `a` is the integer value of the third space-separated token from the next line `s`, `z` is `k - 1` and `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `z` is updated by adding the value of `z // (k - 1) + 1` to itself. Since `z` was initially set to `k - 1`, the new value of `z` becomes `(k - 1) + ((k - 1) // (k - 1) + 1)`. Given that `(k - 1) // (k - 1)` is 1 (since `k - 1` divided by itself is 1), the expression simplifies to `(k - 1) + 1 + 1`, which is `k + 1`. Therefore, `z` is now `k + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
