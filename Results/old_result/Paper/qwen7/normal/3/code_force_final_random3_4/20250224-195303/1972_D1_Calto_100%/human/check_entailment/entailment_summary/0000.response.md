Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The provided code includes a function `func_1` which correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers. This is used to calculate \(\gcd(a, b)\) within `func_2`.
- However, the implementation of `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem. The logic inside `func_2` seems to be based on a misunderstanding of the problem constraints and requirements. Specifically, it uses a formula involving \(i^2\) and \(i(i-1)\), which does not align with the problem statement.
- Given the execution summary for `func_2`, it appears that the function is incorrectly attempting to count valid pairs using a formula that does not match the problem's requirements. The output hints suggest that the function is returning a fixed value (20) rather than computing the actual number of valid pairs for the given \(n\) and \(m\).

Since `func_2` does not correctly implement the solution to the problem, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
