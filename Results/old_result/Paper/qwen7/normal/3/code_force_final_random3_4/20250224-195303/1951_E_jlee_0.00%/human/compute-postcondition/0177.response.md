Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is 2, `done` is True, `count` is 1, `count2` is 1**

Explanation: The code increments `count2` by 1. Initially, `count2` is not mentioned, so it is assumed to be 0. After executing `count2 += 1`, `count2` becomes 1. The values of `j`, `n`, `done`, and `count` remain unchanged from their initial states.
