Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` which is currently 2, `done` is True, and `x` is the first character of the list `s`. If the current value of `x` is not equal to the last element of the list `s`, we continue the loop or iteration.
