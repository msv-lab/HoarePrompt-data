Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for a in inp:
    if a <= x:
        x = a
    elif a <= y:
        y = a
    else:
        x == y
        y = a
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` and `x` are integers. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is set to `a`. If `a` is greater than `x`, then `x` is set to `y`, `y` is set to `a`, and `ans` is 1 if `a` is less than or equal to `y`. Otherwise, `y` is set to `a` and all other variables retain their values from the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is updated to the next element from `inp`. `x` and `y` retain their current values unless `a` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`. In that case, `ans` is incremented by 1. If `a` is greater than `y`, then `y` is updated to `a`. The final values of `x` and `y` are such that either `x` retains its original value and `y` is updated to `a`, or `x` is updated to `a` and `y` retains its original value. The value of `ans` reflects whether `x` equals `y` after the update.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` is the next element from `inp`, `x` retains its value, `y` is either equal to `a` or remains unchanged, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a` is greater than `y`, otherwise `ans` retains its value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
