Postcondition: **`encoded` is now a non-empty string (one character shorter) consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length \( n \) satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 - 1 \); `decoded` is a list where each character in the original `encoded` string, except the first one, has been appended to according to the `mapping`. If the character `char` is in `mapping`, the corresponding decoded character is appended to `decoded`. Otherwise, 'z' is added to `decoded` and `mapping` if it does not already exist.**
