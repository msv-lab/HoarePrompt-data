Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head defines the variables `j` and the range of values it iterates over. Specifically, the loop iterates over `j` in the range from `start_index` to `start_index + i + 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is now equal to `i`.
   - `j` must be less than or equal to `start_index + i + 1`.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `start_index + i + 1`.
   - Since `j` is currently equal to `i`, the next value of `j` will be `i + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `j` will be incremented to `i + 1`.
   - `j` must still be less than or equal to `start_index + i + 1`.

Given these points, let's update the state:

- `j` is currently `i`.
- After the next iteration, `j` will be `i + 1`.
- The condition `j <= start_index + i + 1` must still hold true.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: `j` is now equal to `i + 1`, `j` must be less than or equal to `start_index + i + 1`**.
