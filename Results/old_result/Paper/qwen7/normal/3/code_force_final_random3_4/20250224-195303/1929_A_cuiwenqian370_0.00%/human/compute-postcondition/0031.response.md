Output State: `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, and `new_arr` is a list containing all elements from `arr` but in a specific order. Specifically, the elements are appended to `new_arr` in pairs starting from the ends towards the center. If there is an odd number of elements in `arr`, the middle element will be the last element in `new_arr`.

To elaborate, the loop continues until `left` exceeds `right`. During each iteration, if `left` equals `right`, the single element at `left` (or `right`) is appended to `new_arr`. Otherwise, the elements at `right` and `left` are appended to `new_arr` in that order. After each iteration, `left` is incremented and `right` is decremented. Once the loop finishes, `left` will be equal to `n` (since it starts at 0 and is incremented until it reaches `n`), `right` will be `-1` (since it starts at `n-1` and is decremented until it goes below 0), and `new_arr` will contain all elements from `arr` in the described order.
