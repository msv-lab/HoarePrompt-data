Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS". `trumps` is a list containing all ranks of cards that had the same suit as the trump suit, sorted in ascending order. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to `None`. `answers` is a list containing strings formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` for each suit in 'CDHS', where each string is formed only once per unique pair of `suits[suit]` and `rank`.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the `trumps` list will contain all ranks of cards that matched the trump suit, sorted in ascending order. The `suits` dictionary will have all values set to `None` since any non-trump suit's value will be overwritten in subsequent iterations if a higher rank card of the same suit is encountered. The `answers` list will contain unique strings formed by sorting and joining the values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` for each suit, ensuring no duplicate pairs are included.
