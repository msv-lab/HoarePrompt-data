Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Bob', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces. Clues[2] is less than or equal to clues[4], clues[0] is not equal to 1, and either both clues[2] and clues[4] are even or both are odd. Additionally, `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, and `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to `clues[5]`. The current value of `clues[3]` is less than or equal to the current value of `clues[5]`. Furthermore, if the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or the difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'.**
