Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the size of the array), `x` and `y` (two integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers), and `arr` (a list of integers representing the elements of the array). After processing all tuples in `test_cases`, the function returns an empty list since no iterations were performed and `results` was initialized as an empty list.**
