Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1, `i` is equal to the length of `paths`, `k` is equal to the length of `paths`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the loop iterations, `ress` holds the final maximum value between all `curr` values, `pathb` contains all elements added until `vis[pb - 1] == 1`, `paths` is an empty list, `n` is an integer from the first input string, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop, `ps` is an integer from the fourth input string, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the first input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code initializes `vis` as a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1. No other variables are affected by this line of code, so their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state retains the values of all variables as described in the initial state, with the only change being the initialization of `vis` as specified.
