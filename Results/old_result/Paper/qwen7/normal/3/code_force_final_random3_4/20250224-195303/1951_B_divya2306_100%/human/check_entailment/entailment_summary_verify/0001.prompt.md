You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3

    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

- Function Summary: 
The function reads two integers `n` and `k` followed by a list of `n` distinct integers `a`. It then counts the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to the `k-1`th element. If this count (`wins`) is at least `k`, it prints `wins - 1` and returns. Otherwise, it calculates a new count (`win_with_swap`) by considering the possibility of swapping one element. Finally, it prints the maximum of `wins - 1` and `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)` and returns `None`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of matches the cow at position `k` can win.
   - We can either do nothing or swap the cow at position `k` with another cow to maximize the number of wins.

2. **Initial Analysis of the Provided Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of cows) and `k` (the cow's index).
   - It then reads the ratings of the cows into a list `a`.
   - The variable `wins` is initialized to count the number of wins the cow at position `k` would have without any swaps.
   - The first loop counts how many cows before position `k` have a higher rating than the cow at position `k`. This gives the initial number of wins without any swaps.
   - If the cow at position `k` can win all previous matches (`wins >= k`), it prints `wins - 1` because the cow cannot win the match against itself.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of wins if the cow at position `k` is swapped with another cow. This involves counting how many cows from the position `win_with_swap` to `k-1` have a higher rating than the cow at position `k`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for counting wins without any swaps seems correct.
   - The logic for calculating the number of wins with a swap also seems correct, but there is a potential issue in the final result calculation.
   - The expression `max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0))` might not be correctly handling the edge cases where `wins` is zero.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the cow at position `k` has the highest rating, it should win all matches without any swaps.
   - If the cow at position `k` has the lowest rating, it should not win any matches even with a swap.

### Conclusion:
The provided code handles most cases correctly, but there is a potential issue with the final result calculation. Specifically, the expression `max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0))` might not handle the edge cases properly.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the issue, we can simplify the final result calculation to ensure it handles all edge cases correctly. Here is a revised version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(k):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        wins += 1
    if wins >= k:
        print(wins - 1)
        return
    win_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(k, n - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        win_with_swap += 1
    print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - 1))
```

This revised version ensures that the final result is calculated correctly, handling all edge cases.
