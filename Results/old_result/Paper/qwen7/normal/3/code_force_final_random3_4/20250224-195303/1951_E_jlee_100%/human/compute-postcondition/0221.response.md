Output State: **`s` is a string, the character at index `j` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`, `done` is True.**

Explanation: The variable `done` is assigned the boolean value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of `s` or the condition regarding the characters at indices `j` and `n - 1 - j`. Therefore, these conditions remain unchanged.
