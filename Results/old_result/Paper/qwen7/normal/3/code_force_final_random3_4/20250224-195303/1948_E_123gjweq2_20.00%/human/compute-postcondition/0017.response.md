Output State: **`i` is `not_mid - 1`; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `clique`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `big_element - i`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + mid + i]`. It also mentions that `arr[left + mid + i]` was previously assigned the value `big_element - i`. Since no other variables are affected, these are the only changes made.
