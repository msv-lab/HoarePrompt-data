Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1, `i` is equal to the length of `paths`, `k` is equal to the length of `paths`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the loop iterations, `ress` holds the final maximum value between all `curr` values, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]` and `a[pb - 1]` with an additional element `a[pb - 1]` appended, `paths` is an empty list, `n` is an integer from the first input string, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer from the fourth input string, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the first input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead exits the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, all the variables retain their previous values, and the only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
