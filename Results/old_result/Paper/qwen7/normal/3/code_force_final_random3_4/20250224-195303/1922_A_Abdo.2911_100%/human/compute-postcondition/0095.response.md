Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is `t + 1`; `possible` is True**

Explanation: The variable `possible` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `possible` along with the unchanged values of `i` and `n`.
