The variables in the loop head are `left` and `right`, so we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `left <= right`. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is 2, and `right` is `right - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `left <= right` must still hold true.

Since `right` is updated to `right - 1` at the end of each iteration, for the loop to continue, `right` must be at least 1 (since `left` is 2 and `left` is less than or equal to `right`).

Therefore, we need to ensure that `right` is at least 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`left` is 2, `right` must be at least 1**
