Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `p`. The variables `t`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states.
