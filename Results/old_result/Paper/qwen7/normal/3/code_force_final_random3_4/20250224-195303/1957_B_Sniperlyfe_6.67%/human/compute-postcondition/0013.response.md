Output State: **The program returns a list `nums` where each element is initially set to the value `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, then `k` is reduced by the sum of all values in `nums`, and finally, `nums[-1]` is incremented by the final value of `k`.**

To break this down:
1. Each element in the list `nums` is initially set to the value `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`.
2. The value of `k` is then reduced by the sum of all values in `nums`.
3. The last element of `nums` is incremented by the final value of `k`.

Since the exact values of `k` and `nums` are not given, we can only describe the transformation process applied to `nums`.
