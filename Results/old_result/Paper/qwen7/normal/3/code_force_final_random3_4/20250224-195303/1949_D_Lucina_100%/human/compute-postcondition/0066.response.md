Output State: **`j` is 3, `b[i]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. Since `j` was updated to 3 in the initial state, and no other changes were made to `j` or `b[i]`, these values remain unchanged except for the increment operation on `b[i]`.
