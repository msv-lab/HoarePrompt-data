Output State: **`gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x-2`, `y` is `x-2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x-2)`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + (x-2)`, `best_y` is `x-2`**

Explanation: The line `best_y = y` assigns the current value of `y` to `best_y`. Since `y` was previously defined as `x-2`, `best_y` now holds the value `x-2`. All other variables (`gcd_val`, `y`, `current_sum`, `max_sum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
