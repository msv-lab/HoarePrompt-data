Postcondition: `nx` is either 'F' or 'S', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and the character at position `j - 1` in `xx[i]` is `'?'`. Additionally, if either `i` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, if neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, then `nx` is 'S'.
