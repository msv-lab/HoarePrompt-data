Output State: `func_6()` has been called 10^4 times.

Explanation: The loop runs `testcases` times, which is the result of `func_3()`. Since the output state after 3 iterations already indicates that `func_6()` has been called, we can infer that `func_6()` will be called once per iteration of the loop. Therefore, after all iterations (which is `10^4` times), `func_6()` will have been called `10^4` times.
