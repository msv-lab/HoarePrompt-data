Output State: **`d` is a dictionary where the value of key `i` is increased by 1, `pl` is a list, and `i` is the next element in `palka`.**

This means that the dictionary `d` has its value associated with the key `i` incremented by 1. The list `pl` and the variable `i` being the next element in `palka` remain unchanged from their initial states.
