Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, buffer is a list containing integers from the input, i is 0, n must be a non-negative integer, j is n, q is a list of length n + 1 where each element is 0, eta is a list containing the value `j`, and if `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `q[j]` remains unchanged and eta contains the value `j`.
