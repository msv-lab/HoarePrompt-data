Output State: **i is n, maxi is n-1, n is greater than n-1, and res is an input string which is not '<'.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value of `n`, as the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n-1`. The variable `maxi` will be set to `n-1` because every time `res` is '<', `maxi` is updated to the current value of `i`, and the last value `i` takes before exiting the loop is `n-1`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. Additionally, `res` will be an input string that is not '<' since the loop exits when `i` reaches `n`, meaning the condition `res == '<'` was not met for `i = n`.
