Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving two paths represented by lists `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates the minimum cumulative cost to travel from a starting position to an ending position, considering the costs of switching to path `a` or passing through path `b` at each step. It prints the minimum cumulative cost for each test case.**
