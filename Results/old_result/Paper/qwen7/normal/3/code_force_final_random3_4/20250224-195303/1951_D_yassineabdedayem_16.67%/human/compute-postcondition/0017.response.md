Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` must be non-zero, `k` is either `k - Min` (where `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`) or decreased by `Min`, `rep` is 0, `number` is either `Min` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of the variable `number` to the list `tab`. Since `tab` was initially an empty list, after appending `str(number)`, `tab` now contains one element, which is the string representation of `number`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
