Output State: **`flag` is an integer, `i` is 29, the character at index `i` of string `s` is undefined**

Explanation: The code attempts to assign the value `'1'` to the character at index `i` of string `s`. However, since `i` is 29 and the string `s` does not have 30 characters (indexing starts from 0), accessing `s[29]` results in an attempt to modify an undefined part of the string. No changes are made to the variables `flag` or `i`, and the character at index `i` of string `s` remains undefined.
