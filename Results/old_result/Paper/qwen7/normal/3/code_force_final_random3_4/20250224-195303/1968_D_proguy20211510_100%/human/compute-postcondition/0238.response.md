Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1, `num_iterations` is decremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the original `n`, `k` is the integer value of the original `k`, `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the integer value of the original `ps`, `p` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]` appended with `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to the list `pathb`. Since `pathb` was initially a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`, after appending `a[pb - 1]` again, `pathb` now contains two occurrences of `a[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
