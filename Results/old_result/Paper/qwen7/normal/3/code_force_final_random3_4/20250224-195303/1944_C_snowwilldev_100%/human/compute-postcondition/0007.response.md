Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop condition is `range(N)`, which means `i` will iterate from 0 to `N-1`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
   - `N` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
   - `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with all values initialized to 0.
   - `i` is `i + 1` (implying `i` was incremented in the previous iteration).
   - `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since `i` was incremented in the previous iteration, it means `i` is now `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `N`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to `i + 1` again.
   - `cnt[a[i]]` should be incremented by 1, where `i` is now `i + 1`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` should be set to `i + 1`.
   - `cnt[a[i]]` should be incremented by 1, where `i` is now `i + 1`.

Given these steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with all values initialized to 0, `i` is `i + 2`, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

However, since `i` is incremented in each iteration, the correct representation should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with all values initialized to 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

But to reflect the next iteration clearly:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with all values initialized to 0, `i` is `i + 2`, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

This ensures that the loop can continue executing as long as `i < N`.
