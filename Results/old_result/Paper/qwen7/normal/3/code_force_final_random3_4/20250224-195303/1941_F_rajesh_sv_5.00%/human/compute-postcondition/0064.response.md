Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is either `mid` or `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` is the index such that all elements in `D` before index `l` are less than `left - f`, and `l` is the smallest index where `D[l]` is greater than or equal to `left - f`, and `l` is less than `h`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `l` is `mid + 1`**.

Explanation: The line `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to be `mid + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
