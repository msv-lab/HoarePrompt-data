Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1'; `x` is the last element of the sublist in `S[-1]`; `y` is the second last element of the sublist in `S[-1]` plus 1.**

Explanation: The code `y += 1` increments the value of `y` by 1. Since `y` was originally the second last element of the sublist in `S[-1]`, after executing the code, `y` becomes the second last element of the sublist in `S[-1]` plus 1. The values of `a` and `x` remain unchanged.
