Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is the minimum value encountered in `inp`, `y` is the second minimum value encountered in `inp` (or `y` remains unchanged if no second unique minimum was found), and `ans` is the count of distinct minimum values in `inp` greater than `y`, and the input value is decremented by 1.**

This means that `n` is now set to the integer value entered by the user, while the values of `x`, `y`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their previous states, and the input value (`n`) is decremented by 1.
