Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Descriptions:**
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `mak` is either `n-1` or any value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive.
   - `i` is `i + 1`. This means `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `pans` contains either `[i]` or `[i+1]` (if `s == '<'`) or the element `n` (if `s != '<'`).
   - `s` is assigned the value of the input string.
   - `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called, but this does not affect the print statement directly.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)`.
   - We need to determine the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`.

Given that `mak2` is equal to `mak`, we can simplify the print statement to `print('?', mak, mak, i, mak)`.

3. **Values Determination:**
   - `mak` can be either `n-1` or any value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive.
   - `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `mak2` is the same as `mak`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `mak2`, which are all the same.

Output: **'? [mak] [mak] [i] [mak]' (where mak is either n-1 or any value between 0 and n-2, inclusive, and i is the incremented value of its previous state)**
