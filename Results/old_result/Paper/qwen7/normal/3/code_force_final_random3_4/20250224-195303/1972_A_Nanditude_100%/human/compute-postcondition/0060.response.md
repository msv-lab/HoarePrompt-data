Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(n)`.
   - The variable `j` is the loop index.
   - The variable `n` is the upper limit of the range.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop variables**:
   - `j` is not explicitly initialized in the given state, but it will start from 0 as per the `range(n)` function.
   - `n` is given as an input integer.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop `for j in range(n)` to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the range function starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - The variable `j` will start from 0, but since the loop depends on `n`, we need to ensure `n` is at least 1.
   - The variables `cnt`, `_`, `i`, `a`, and `b` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than 0.

The final state after adjusting for the loop to execute is:
**`n` must be greater than 0**

So, the answer is:
**State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
