Output State: **`nx` is a string ending with 'F', `j` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. If the element at index `j-1` in the list `xx[i]` is not `'?'`, then `nx` is the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` followed by 'F'. If the element at index `j-1` in the list `xx[i]` is `'?'`, then `nx` is `'F'` followed by 'F'. Additionally, if either `i` is in the range `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` ends with 'FS'.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends 'F' to the existing string `nx`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the updated state of `nx` includes the original value plus an additional 'F'. The conditions regarding the elements in the list `xx[i]` and the ranges of `i` and `j` relative to `sb` also remain as per the initial state.
