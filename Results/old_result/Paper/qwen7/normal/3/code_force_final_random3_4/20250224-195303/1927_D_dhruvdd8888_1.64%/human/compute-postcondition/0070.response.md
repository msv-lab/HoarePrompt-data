Based on the initial state provided:

- `ppp` is explicitly given as 23.
- `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to a tuple using `map` and `int` functions. However, since no specific input is provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `l` and `r`.
- `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to keep the list `arr` sorted. Without knowing the contents of `arr`, we cannot determine `eli`.
- `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from `arr[min(eli, len(arr)-1)]`. Again, without knowing the contents of `arr` or the value of `eli`, we cannot determine these values.
- `e` is greater than or equal to `N`. Since `N` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `e`.

However, the print statement is:

```python
print(-1, -1)
```

This statement directly prints the values `-1` and `-1` regardless of the values of other variables.

Output: **-1 -1**
