The function processes a list of integers `a` and handles a series of queries. It first calculates a cumulative sum list `b` based on the values in `a`. Then, for each query, it compares the sum of a specified sublist in `a` with a corresponding value derived from `b`, and prints 'YES' if the sum in `a` is greater than or equal to the value from `b`, or 'NO' otherwise.
