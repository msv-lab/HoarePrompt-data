Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(3, n + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as `i` is 4, and `n` must be greater than 4.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. Given that `i` is currently 4, the loop will continue if `n` is greater than 4.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since it starts from 3 and increments by default in the range function). Therefore, `i` will become 5. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

So, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 4**
