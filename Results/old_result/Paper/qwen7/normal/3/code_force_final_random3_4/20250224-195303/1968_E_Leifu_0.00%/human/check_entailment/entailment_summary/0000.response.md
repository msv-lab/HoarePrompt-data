Reasoning:
The program attempts to generate a set of points that maximizes the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. However, the implementation has some issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Handling for \(n = 3\)**: The program correctly prints "2 3" for \(n = 3\), which is part of the optimal solution.
2. **Handling for \(n > 3\)**: The program prints "2 4" and then pairs from "4" to \(n\) with themselves. This approach does not always maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

For example, consider \(n = 4\):
- The program prints: 
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  2 4
  4 4
  4 4
  4 4
  ```
- The Manhattan distances are:
  - \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \)
  - \( |1-1| + |2-2| = 0 \)
  - \( |2-2| + |4-4| = 0 \)
  - \( |4-4| + |4-4| = 0 \)
  - \( |4-4| + |4-4| = 0 \)
  - \( |4-4| + |4-4| = 0 \)
- Thus, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0\}\), which has only 1 element.

However, the optimal solution for \(n = 4\) should include points like:
```
1 1
1 3
4 3
4 4
```
Which gives:
- Distances: \{0, 2, 1, 3\}, thus \(\mathcal{H}\) has 4 elements.

Therefore, the current implementation does not always produce the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

Correctness: **False**
