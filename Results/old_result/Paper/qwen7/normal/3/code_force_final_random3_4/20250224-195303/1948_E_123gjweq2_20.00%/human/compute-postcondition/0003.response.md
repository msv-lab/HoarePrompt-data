Output State: **`left` is an integer such that `left` < `right`, `right` is an integer, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1)) // 2, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `not_mid` which is defined as `right - left + 1 - mid`. Given the initial conditions, `mid` is already calculated as `(right + 1 - (left + 1)) // 2`. Therefore, `not_mid` is updated based on the values of `left`, `right`, and `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged.
