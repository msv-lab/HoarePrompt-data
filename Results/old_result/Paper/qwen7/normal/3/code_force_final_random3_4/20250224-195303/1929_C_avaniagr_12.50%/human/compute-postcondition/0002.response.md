Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9; `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned the values from the input split into integers.**

Explanation: The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. The conditions on the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain valid, but their specific values are now determined by the input.
