Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` which is greater than `left - f`, `h` is now `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, and `h` and `l` are equal to each other, representing the final boundaries of the search range, and `mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum`**
