Output State: **`arr` is sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`; `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[n // 2]` to the end of `arr`.**

Explanation: The `heapq.heapify(heap)` function transforms the list `heap` into a heap in-place. A heap is a binary tree where each parent node is less than or equal to its child nodes (min-heap). After calling `heapq.heapify(heap)`, the list `heap` is no longer in its original order but is now a heap. The other variables (`arr`, `median_index`, and `current_median`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the heapify operation.
