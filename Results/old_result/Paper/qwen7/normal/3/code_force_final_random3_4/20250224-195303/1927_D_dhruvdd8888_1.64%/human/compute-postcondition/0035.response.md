Output State: **`ppp` is 23, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to a tuple using map and int functions.**

The initial value of `ppp` remains unchanged at 23. The code splits the input into two parts and converts them into integers, assigning them to `l` and `r`. Since the exact input values are not specified, we can only describe `l` and `r` as integers obtained from the split and conversion process.
