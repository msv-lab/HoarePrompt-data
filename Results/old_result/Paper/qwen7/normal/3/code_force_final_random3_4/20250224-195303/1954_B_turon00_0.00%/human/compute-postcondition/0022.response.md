Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list that is 1 more than the previous value of `i`, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `ans` remains the minimum between its current value and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The value of `i` is updated to be 1 more than its previous value, and the condition for updating `ans` (if the element at index `i` in list `a` equals `tmp`) is not addressed in this line of code, so `ans` remains unchanged.
