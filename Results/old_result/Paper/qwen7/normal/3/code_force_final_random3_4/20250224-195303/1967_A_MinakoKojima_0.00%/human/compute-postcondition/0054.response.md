Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans` is multiplied by `a[1] - a[0]`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is multiplied by the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]`. Since the initial value of `i` is 1, the index `i-1` would refer to `a[0]`. However, without knowing the actual values of `a[0]` and `a[1]`, we cannot simplify further. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1, and `ans` is updated to its current value multiplied by the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]`.
