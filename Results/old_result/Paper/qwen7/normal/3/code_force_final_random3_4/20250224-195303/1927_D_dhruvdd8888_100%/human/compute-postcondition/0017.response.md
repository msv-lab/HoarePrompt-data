Output State: **`i` is 2, `N` is a valid positive integer, `arr` contains one element which is a tuple (2 + `s`, 1, `num`).**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple to the list `arr`. The tuple contains three elements: `(1 + s, i, num)`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, the value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The values of `s` and `num` remain unchanged from their initial state, as they are not defined in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the tuple added to `arr` is `(2 + s, 1, num)`.
