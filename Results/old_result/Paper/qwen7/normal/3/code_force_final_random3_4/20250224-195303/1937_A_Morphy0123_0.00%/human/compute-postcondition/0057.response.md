Output State: **`power` is equal to `power` + 1 and is still less than `log2(n)`, and `n` must be greater than 128**.

This means that the `power` variable has been incremented by 1, but it still needs to satisfy the condition of being less than `log2(n)`. The condition that `n` must be greater than 128 remains unchanged.
