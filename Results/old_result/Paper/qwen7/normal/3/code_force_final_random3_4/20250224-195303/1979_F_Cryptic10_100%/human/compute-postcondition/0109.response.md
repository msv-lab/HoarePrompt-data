Postcondition: `vx` has at least 2 elements. If `v2 > 0`, then `vx` has the first element as the last but one element of the original `vx` and the second element as the last element of the original `vx`; `v2` is equal to the last but one element of the original `vx`; `v1` does not exist; `ops` is a list containing a tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2 <= 0`, then `vx` has the first element as `v3`, the second element as the last element of the original `vx`, and `v1` does not exist; `ops` is a list containing two tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.
