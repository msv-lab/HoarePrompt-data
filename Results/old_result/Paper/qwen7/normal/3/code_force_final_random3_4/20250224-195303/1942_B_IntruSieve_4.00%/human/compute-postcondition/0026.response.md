Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same, `minn` is `maxx + 1`, `mex` is now equal to `minn`.**

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be `maxx + 1`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `mex`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `minn` is now specifically set to `maxx + 1`, and `mex` is also updated to reflect this new value of `minn`.
