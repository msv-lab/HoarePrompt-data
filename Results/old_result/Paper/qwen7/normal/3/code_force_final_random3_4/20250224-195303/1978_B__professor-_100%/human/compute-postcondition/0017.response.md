Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and is reduced by 1, so `t = t - 1`.
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `a` is the second integer input.
- `b` is the third integer input.

We need to evaluate the expression inside the `print` statement:
\[ \text{int}((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2) \]

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Expression Inside the Parentheses**: 
   \[ 2 * b - n + 1 \]
   This is a simple arithmetic operation involving `b` and `n`.

2. **Multiplication with `n`**:
   \[ (2 * b - n + 1) * n \]
   This multiplies the result from the previous step by `n`.

3. **Integer Division by 2**:
   \[ (2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2 \]
   This performs integer division by 2 on the result from the previous step.

4. **Conversion to Integer**:
   \[ \text{int}((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2) \]
   Finally, the result is converted to an integer.

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not specified, we cannot provide a specific numerical output. However, we can describe the expression in terms of `n` and `b`.

Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)**
