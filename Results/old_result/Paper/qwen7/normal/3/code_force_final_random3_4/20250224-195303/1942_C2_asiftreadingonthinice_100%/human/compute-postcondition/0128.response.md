Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in tmp`. The variables involved here are `i` and `tmp`.

2. **Understand the postcondition from the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is the first element of `tmp`.
   - `tmp` is a sorted list with at least one element.
   - `ans` is increased by `i - 1` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the first element of `tmp`, for the next iteration, `i` will be the second element of `tmp`.
   - `tmp` must still be a sorted list with at least one element. However, since `i` changes to the next element, `tmp` should now contain at least two elements (the first and the second).
   - The value of `ans` does not change based on the loop itself but rather on the condition inside the loop body. Therefore, the value of `ans` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Based on these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `tmp`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is the second element of `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list with at least two elements, and `ans` is the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration**.
