### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. The beauty is maximized by arranging the array in such a way that the positive differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array elements.
   - It calls `func_1(n, arr)` to compute the maximum beauty.
   - `func_1` sorts the array and then alternately appends the smallest and largest remaining elements to `new_arr`. This approach aims to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Checking the Logic in `func_1`**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest and largest elements are considered first.
   - By alternating between the smallest and largest elements, the function tries to create the largest possible differences between consecutive elements.
   - The loop calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

4. **Validation**:
   - The logic in `func_1` seems to follow the strategy of maximizing differences by alternating between the smallest and largest elements.
   - This approach works because it ensures that the largest possible differences are used at each step, which aligns with the objective of maximizing the beauty.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by rearranging its elements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
