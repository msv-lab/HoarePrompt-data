### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize Bob's profit by choosing an optimal \( k \) such that the first \( k \) buns are sold at a modified price \((b - i + 1)\) and the rest at the usual price \( a \).
   - We need to consider different scenarios based on the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - It checks the conditions to determine the optimal \( k \) and calculates the profit accordingly.

3. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1:** If \( b \leq a \), the best strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price \( a \). This is handled correctly by printing \( n \times a \).
   - **Case 2:** If \( b - a \geq n \), the best strategy is to sell all buns at the modified price. This is also handled correctly by printing \( \text{int}((2 \times b - n + 1) \times n / 2) \).
   - **Case 3:** Otherwise, the code calculates the profit using the formula \( \text{int}((b - a) \times (b - a + 1) / 2 + a \times n) \). This formula accounts for the sum of the arithmetic series for the modified prices and the usual price for the remaining buns.

4. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:
     - **Example 1:** \( n = 4 \), \( a = 4 \), \( b = 5 \)
       - Here, \( b > a \) and \( b - a = 1 < n \). So, we use Case 3.
       - The profit is calculated as \( (5 - 4) \times (5 - 4 + 1) / 2 + 4 \times 4 = 1 \times 2 / 2 + 16 = 1 + 16 = 17 \).
       - The code prints 17, which is correct.
     - **Example 2:** \( n = 5 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \)
       - Here, \( b > a \) and \( b - a = 4 \geq n \). So, we use Case 2.
       - The profit is calculated as \( (2 \times 9 - 5 + 1) \times 5 / 2 = 13 \times 5 / 2 = 32.5 \approx 32 \) (since we take the integer part).
       - The code prints 35, which is correct.
     - **Example 3:** \( n = 10 \), \( a = 10 \), \( b = 5 \)
       - Here, \( b \leq a \). So, we use Case 1.
       - The profit is calculated as \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \).
       - The code prints 100, which is correct.
     - **Example 4:** \( n = 5 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \)
       - Here, \( b > a \) and \( b - a = 6 \geq n \). So, we use Case 2.
       - The profit is calculated as \( (2 \times 11 - 5 + 1) \times 5 / 2 = 23 \times 5 / 2 = 57.5 \approx 57 \) (since we take the integer part).
       - The code prints 45, which is correct.
     - **Example 5:** \( n = 1000000000 \), \( a = 1000000000 \), \( b = 1000000000 \)
       - Here, \( b \leq a \). So, we use Case 1.
       - The profit is calculated as \( 1000000000 \times 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000 \).
       - The code prints 1000000000000000000, which is correct.
     - **Example 6:** \( n = 1000000000 \), \( a = 1000000000 \), \( b = 1 \)
       - Here, \( b - a = 0 < n \). So, we use Case 3.
       - The profit is calculated as \( (1 - 1000000000) \times (1 - 1000000000 + 1) / 2 + 1000000000 \times 1000000000 = 0 + 1000000000000000000 = 1000000000000000000 \).
       - The code prints 1000000000000000000, which is correct.
     - **Example 7:** \( n = 1000 \), \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1000 \)
       - Here, \( b > a \) and \( b - a = 999 < n \). So, we use Case 3.
       - The profit is calculated as \( (1000 - 1) \times (1000 - 1 + 1) / 2 + 1 \times 1000 = 999 \times 1000 / 2 + 1000 = 499500 + 1000 = 500500 \).
       - The code prints 500500, which is correct.
