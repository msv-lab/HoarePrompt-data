Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is equal to `mak`, so `mak2` is also 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `pans` must have at least 2 elements.
- `s` will contain the final input string received, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

Let's break down the values being printed:

- `pans[mak]`: Since `mak` is 0, this refers to the first element of `pans`.
- `pans[mak]`: Again, since `mak` is 0, this also refers to the first element of `pans`.
- `pans[i]`: Since `i` is `n-1`, this refers to the last element of `pans`.

Therefore, the print statement will output a question mark followed by the first element of `pans` twice, and the last element of `pans` twice.

Output: **? [first element of pans] [first element of pans] [last element of pans] [last element of pans]**
