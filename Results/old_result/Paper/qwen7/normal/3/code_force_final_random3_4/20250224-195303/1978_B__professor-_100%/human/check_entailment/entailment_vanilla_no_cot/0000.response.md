Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python function correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all the buns under the given promotion rules. Here's a breakdown of the function:

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - If `b <= a`, it means the usual price is higher or equal to the modified price. Therefore, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
   - If `b - a >= n`, it means the modified price for the first `n` buns is less than or equal to the usual price. In this case, Bob should sell the first `n` buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price.
   - Otherwise, Bob should sell the first `k` buns at the modified prices and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price. The optimal `k` can be determined by finding the point where the sum of the modified prices equals the sum of the usual prices for the remaining buns.

The function correctly handles all these cases and calculates the maximum profit accordingly. Therefore, the provided solution is correct.
