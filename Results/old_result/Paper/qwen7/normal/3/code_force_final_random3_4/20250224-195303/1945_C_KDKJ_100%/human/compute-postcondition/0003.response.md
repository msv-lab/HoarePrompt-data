Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\)**

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called, but since no details about what `func_1()` does are provided, the only thing we can conclude is that the call to `func_1()` itself does not change the value of `n`. Therefore, `n` remains an integer within the specified range.
