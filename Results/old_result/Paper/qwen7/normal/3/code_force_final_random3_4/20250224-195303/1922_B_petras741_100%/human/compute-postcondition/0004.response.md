Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `w`. Since `w` is assigned to `buffer`, `buffer` now contains the integers from the input. The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
