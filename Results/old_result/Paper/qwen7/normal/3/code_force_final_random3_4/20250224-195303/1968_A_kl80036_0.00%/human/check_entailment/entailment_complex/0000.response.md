Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Here's why:

1. The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
2. The current implementation simply sets \( y = x // 2 \) for each test case. This does not guarantee that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.

For example, consider \( x = 10 \):
- If we use \( y = 5 \), then \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7\).
- However, if we choose \( y = 9 \), then \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\), which is greater than 7.

Therefore, the program does not always find the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

Correctness: **False**
