Output State: **`cases` is 3, `arr` is [1], `j` must be between 0 and 1 inclusive, `lex` is an input integer - 1, and the current value of `lex` is less than or equal to 25.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 1. Since the initial value of `lex` was an input integer less than or equal to 26, subtracting 1 from it means the new value of `lex` is now an input integer less than or equal to 25. All other variables remain unchanged.
