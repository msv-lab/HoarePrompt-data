Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(cnt)`. The only variable directly involved in the loop condition is `cnt`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `cnt` must be greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` must be greater than 0.
   - `ans` is a list where the last element is now equal to the second last element minus 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `cnt` is greater than 0, `cnt` must still be greater than 0 for the next iteration.
   - The list `ans` does not change within the loop itself based on the given information, so its state remains the same.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `cnt`, which must still be greater than 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`cnt` must be greater than 0; `ans` is a list where the last element is now equal to the second last element minus 1**.
