Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i + 1`: This implies that `i` is incremented by 1. However, since the exact value of `i` before this operation is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `i` after the increment.
- `t` remains unchanged: The value of `t` is not modified and retains its original value.
- `a` is an input string: The value of `a` is an unknown string provided as input.
- `count` is the number of '1's in `a`: This means `count` is the count of the character '1' in the string `a`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string 'NO' without any reference to the variables `i`, `t`, or `count`.

Output: **NO**
