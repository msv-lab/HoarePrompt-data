Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the variables and their states:

1. The loop continues until `i` reaches `n-1`.
2. After all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`.
3. `n` will be greater than or equal to `n`, which implies `n` remains unchanged.
4. `array` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
5. `a` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop:
   - If `(-1)**i` is `-1`, the last element of `a` (`a[-1]`) is decremented by 1, and the corresponding element from `array` is appended to `answer`.
   - Otherwise, the first element of `a` (`a[0]`) is incremented by 1, and the corresponding element from `array` is appended to `answer`.

Given these conditions, the final state of `answer` will be a list where each element is derived from `array` based on the conditions described above, with the length of `answer` being `n-1`.

To determine the exact elements in `answer`, we need to consider the behavior of the loop:
- For even `i`, `(-1)**i` is `1`, so `a[0]` is incremented, and the corresponding element from `array` is appended to `answer`.
- For odd `i`, `(-1)**i` is `-1`, so `a[-1]` is decremented, and the corresponding element from `array` is appended to `answer`.

Since the exact values of `a[0]` and `a[-1]` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of the elements in `answer`. However, we know the structure of how `answer` is constructed.

Therefore, the print statement will output the elements of `answer` in a sequence determined by the conditions described.

Output: **[elements derived from array based on the conditions described]**
