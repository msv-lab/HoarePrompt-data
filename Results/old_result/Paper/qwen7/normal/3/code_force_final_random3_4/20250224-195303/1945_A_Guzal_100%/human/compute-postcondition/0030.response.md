Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` remains unchanged, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
