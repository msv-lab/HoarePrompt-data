Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - The `trumps` list is sorted in descending order.
   - The `trumps` list must not be empty.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - `trumps.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the `trumps` list.
   - Since the `trumps` list is sorted in descending order, the last element is the smallest one.
   - After removing the last element, `trumps.pop()` again removes and returns the new last element of the updated `trumps` list.
   - The `trump` variable is mentioned but not defined in the initial state, so it remains as a placeholder.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - Let's assume the initial `trumps` list is `[T1, T2, T3, ..., Tn]` where `T1 > T2 > T3 > ... > Tn`.
   - After the first `pop`, the last element `Tn` is removed and returned.
   - The remaining list is `[T1, T2, T3, ..., T(n-1)]`.
   - After the second `pop`, the new last element `T(n-1)` is removed and returned.
   - Therefore, the print statement will output the following string: `Tntrump T(n-1)trump`.

5. **Final Output**:
   - Since `trump` is not defined, it remains as a placeholder in the string.
   - The actual values of `Tn` and `T(n-1)` depend on the specific elements in the `trumps` list, but they are the last two elements of the original list in descending order.

Output: **Tntrump T(n-1)trump (where Tn and T(n-1) are the last two elements of the trumps list in descending order)**
