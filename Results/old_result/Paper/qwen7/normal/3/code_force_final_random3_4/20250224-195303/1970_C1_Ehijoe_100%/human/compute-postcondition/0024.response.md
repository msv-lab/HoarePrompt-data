Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `key` and it iterates over the keys in the dictionary `nodes`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: The postcondition states that if the length of `nodes[key]` is exactly one, then `ends` is updated to include an additional element `key`. Otherwise, no change is made to `ends`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - We need to consider the condition under which `ends` might be modified.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `nodes[key]` is a list.
   - For the loop to continue, `key` must be a valid key in `nodes`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `key` is the variable being iterated over, it will be the next key in `nodes`.
   - The list `nodes[key]` will be checked for its length.
   - If the length of `nodes[key]` is exactly one, `ends` will be updated to include `key`.

Given these points, let's formulate the state for the start of the next iteration:

- The variable `key` will be the next key in the dictionary `nodes`.
- The list `nodes[key]` will be checked for its length.
- If the length of `nodes[key]` is exactly one, `ends` will be updated to include `key`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`nodes[key]` is a list, and `ends` is a list with an additional element `key` if the length of `nodes[key]` is exactly one, otherwise no change is made to `ends`**.
