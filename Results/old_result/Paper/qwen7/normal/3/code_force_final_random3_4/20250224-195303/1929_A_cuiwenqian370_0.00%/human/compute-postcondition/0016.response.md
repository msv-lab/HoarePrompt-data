Output State: **`left` is 1, `right` must be at least 1, `new_arr` is a list containing `arr[right]`.**

Explanation: The code `new_arr.append(arr[right])` appends the value of `arr[right]` to the list `new_arr`. Given the initial conditions, `left` remains 1 and `right` must be at least 1. The list `new_arr` initially contains either `arr[1]` (if `left` equals `right`) or `arr[right]` and `arr[left]` (if `left` does not equal `right`). Since `left` does not necessarily equal `right`, the list `new_arr` will now contain `arr[right]` appended to it.
