Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `t` is a value greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
- `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers that are assigned values from the input split into integers.

The print statement is `print(2 + m // a)`. Here, `m // a` represents the integer division of `m` by `a`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `m` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical result of `m // a`. However, we can describe the expression in a general form.

Output: **2 + (m // a)**
