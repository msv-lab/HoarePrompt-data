Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is `n-1`
- `mak2` is `n-1`
- `i` is `n`
- `pans` must have at least 2 elements

The `print` statement is:

```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

Let's break down the values being printed:

- `pans[mak]`: Since `mak` is `n-1`, this refers to the last element in the `pans` list.
- `pans[mak]`: This is the same as above, so it also refers to the last element in the `pans` list.
- `pans[i]`: Since `i` is `n`, this refers to the element at index `n` in the `pans` list. However, since list indices start at 0, this should actually refer to the element at index `n-1` (the last element).
- `pans[i]`: This is the same as above, so it also refers to the last element in the `pans` list.

Given that `pans` must have at least 2 elements, the last two elements in the list will be printed twice each.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **'? [last element of pans] [last element of pans] [last element of pans] [last element of pans]**
