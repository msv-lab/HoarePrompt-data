To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```python
while l < h:
```

This means the loop will continue as long as `l` is less than `h`.

### Current State
- `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`
- `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`
- `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`
- `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`
- `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F` and `l` must be less than `h`.

### Loop Body Analysis
The loop body sets:
- `mid` to `mid + 1` if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`
- `h` to `mid` if `mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum`

### Determining the Next State
For the loop to continue, the condition `l < h` must remain true. Therefore, we need to ensure that `l` is still less than `h` after the loop body executes.

#### Case 1: `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`
- If this condition is true, `mid` is set to `mid + 1`.
- This means `mid` becomes `mid + 1`, and `mid_next_sum` becomes `D[mid + 1 + 1] + f = D[mid + 2] + f`.
- The new `mid_sum` would be `D[mid + 1] + f`.

#### Case 2: `mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum`
- If this condition is true, `h` is set to `mid`.
- This means `h` becomes `mid`, and `mid` remains unchanged.
- The new `mid_next_sum` would be `D[mid + 1] + f`.

In both cases, the loop continues as long as `l` is still less than `h`.

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop continues, we need to maintain the condition `l < h`. Since `l` is determined by the initial conditions and does not change within the loop body, the only state that can change is `h`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `h`.

### Final Answer
State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` must be greater than `l`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F` and `l` must be less than `h`.**
