Output State: **All elements in `inp` have been processed, `x` is the minimum value encountered in `inp`, `y` is the second minimum value encountered in `inp` (or `y` remains unchanged if no second unique minimum was found), and `ans` is the count of distinct minimum values in `inp` greater than `y`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all iterations, `x` will hold the smallest value in the list `inp`, as it is updated whenever a smaller value is encountered. `y` will either be the second smallest unique value in the list or retain its original value if there is no second unique minimum. The variable `ans` will count how many times a value greater than `y` but less than or equal to `x` was encountered, effectively counting the occurrences of the second smallest unique value in the list.
