Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list, and `i` is 0. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is 1, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, based on the conditions involving `clues[1]`, `clues[2]`, `clues[3]`, `clues[4]`, and `clues[5]`, `answers` will contain either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw'.**
