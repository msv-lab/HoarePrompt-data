Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1'; `x` is the last element of the sublist in `S[-1]`; `y` is the second last element of the sublist in `S[-1]`.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = S[-1]` unpacks the last sublist in `S` into the variables `x` and `y`. Since `S` contains a sublist `[x+1, y]` or `[x, y+1]` depending on the next character of `a`, the values of `x` and `y` are now the elements of that sublist. The string `a` remains unchanged.
