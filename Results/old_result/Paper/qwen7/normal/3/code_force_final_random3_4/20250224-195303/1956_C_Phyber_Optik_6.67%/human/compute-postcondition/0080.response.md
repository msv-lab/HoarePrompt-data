Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `n + r + 1` is derived from the condition where \( r \) is the largest integer such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \).
   - `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*range(1, n + 1))
   ```

To determine the value of `n`, let's analyze the condition for `r`:
- The expression \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \) simplifies to \( r < \frac{n + 1}{2} \).
- Therefore, \( r \) is the largest integer less than \( \frac{n + 1}{2} \).

Given that `j` is 1 and `j` is less than or equal to `n`, it implies \( n \geq 1 \). Let's find the maximum \( r \) for different values of \( n \):

- If \( n = 1 \):
  - \( r < \frac{1 + 1}{2} = 1 \), so \( r = 0 \).
  - Hence, \( n + r + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 \).

- If \( n = 2 \):
  - \( r < \frac{2 + 1}{2} = 1.5 \), so \( r = 1 \).
  - Hence, \( n + r + 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 \).

- If \( n = 3 \):
  - \( r < \frac{3 + 1}{2} = 2 \), so \( r = 1 \).
  - Hence, \( n + r + 1 = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \).

From the above, we see that the smallest valid \( n \) is 1, and the corresponding value of \( n + r + 1 \) is 2. For \( n = 1 \), the range function will generate numbers from 1 to \( n \), which is just 1.

Therefore, the value of `n` must be 1 because any larger value would make the condition \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \) invalid for smaller \( n \).

3. **Execution of the Code:**
   - When `n` is 1, the range function `range(1, n + 1)` generates the sequence `[1]`.
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence into positional arguments for the `print` function.

Thus, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **1**
