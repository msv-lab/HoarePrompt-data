Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `ar` minus `n`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `same` is 1, `num` is now `ar[0]`, `ar` is updated with integers from the input, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code `num = ar[0]` assigns the first element of the list `ar` to the variable `num`. Since `ar` is updated with integers from the input, `num` now holds the first element of this updated list.
- The other variables (`i`, `minn`, `same`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.
