Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c` are integers from input, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is `t`.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged as they were not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `a`, `b`, and `c` as integers from the input, while `t` and `i` retain their original values.
