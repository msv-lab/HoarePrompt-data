Postcondition: `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` retains its original value, `x` retains its original value, `y` retains its original value, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is a list containing 1 and the value `(a[4] - a[3]) // 2`, and `i` is 4 if `(a[4] - a[3]) % 2 == 0`. If the condition `(a[4] - a[3]) % 2 == 0` is true, `tmp` will contain the specified value.
