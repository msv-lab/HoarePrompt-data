Postcondition: `n` is an integer input from the user, `a` is an integer input from the user, `b` is an integer input from the user. If `n` is odd, the condition remains unchanged regardless of the relationship between `2 * a` and `b`. If `n` is even, the condition also remains unchanged regardless of the relationship between `2 * a` and `b`.
