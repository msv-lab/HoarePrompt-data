Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list.**

The code initializes a `defaultdict` with the default factory set to `list`. This means that `nodes` is now a dictionary-like object where each key maps to a list. No other variables are affected, so their states remain as they were in the initial state.
