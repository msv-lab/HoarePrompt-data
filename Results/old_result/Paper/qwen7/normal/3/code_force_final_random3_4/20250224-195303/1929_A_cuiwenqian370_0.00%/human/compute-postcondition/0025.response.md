Output State: **`left` is 1, `right` must be at least 1, `new_arr` contains the elements `arr[1]` and `arr[right]`**

Explanation: The code appends `arr[left]` to `new_arr`. Given that `left` is initially 2, the value of `arr[left]` is `arr[2]`. However, since `new_arr` already contains `arr[right]` (where `right` must be at least 1), after appending `arr[left]`, `new_arr` will contain both `arr[1]` (due to the initial condition) and `arr[2]`. The value of `left` is updated to 1 because `arr[left]` was appended, and `right` remains at least 1.
