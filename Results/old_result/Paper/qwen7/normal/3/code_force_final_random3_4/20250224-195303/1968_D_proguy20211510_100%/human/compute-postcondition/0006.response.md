Output State: **`input_value` must be a positive integer, `n` is the converted integer value of the first split value from input, `k` is the converted integer value of the second split value from input, `pb` is the converted integer value of the third split value from input, `ps` is the converted integer value of the fourth split value from input, `p` is a list containing `[n, k, pb, ps]`**.

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes the input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `p`. The values of `input_value`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged, but now `p` is a list containing the integers corresponding to the split values of the input.
