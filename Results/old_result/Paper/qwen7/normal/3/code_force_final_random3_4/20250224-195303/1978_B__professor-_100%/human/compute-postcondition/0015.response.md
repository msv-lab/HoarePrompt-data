Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and is reduced by 1, `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input.**

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. It does not affect the value of `t`. Since `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and it is reduced by 1, the updated state of `t` is still within the same range but reduced by 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are now the integers provided as input.
