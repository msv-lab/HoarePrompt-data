Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr`, `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `c` is 1.**

The variable `c` is initialized to 1, but no other changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.
