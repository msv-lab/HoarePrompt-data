Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to None.
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS". 

- If the suit of the card is equal to the trump suit, `trumps` is a list containing the value of `rank`, and `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to None.
- If the suit of the card is not equal to the trump suit, `answers` is a list containing one element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with the suit, `trumps` is an empty list, and `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values where either all are set to `rank` or the key `suit` is set to `None`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS". If the suit of the card matches the trump suit, `trumps` is a list containing the value of `rank`, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to `None`, and `answers` is an empty list. Otherwise, `trumps` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values either `None` or an integer, `answers` is a list containing one element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` for each suit in 'CDHS', and `card` is a tuple where the first element is assigned to `rank` and the second element is assigned to `suit`. If `suits[suit]` is `None`, `answers` contains a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` for each suit in 'CDHS'. If `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `suits[suit]` is updated to `rank` for the given `suit` and `rank`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trumps` is a list containing the value of `rank` either appended to it or already present, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values either all set to `None` or set to the value of `rank`, `answers` is a list containing either zero or one element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with spaces (if `suits[suit]` is `None`), `rank` is the first element of `card`, `suit` is the second element of `card`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
