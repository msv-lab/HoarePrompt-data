Output State: **`mapping[chr(98)]` is assigned the value of `char`, `c` is now 99, `char` remains unchanged, `encoded` remains unchanged, and `mapping` remains unchanged except for the new entry, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `mapping[chr(98)]`, `c`, `char`, `encoded`, and `mapping` (except for the new entry), but it indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block.
