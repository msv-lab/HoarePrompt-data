Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `ans` is a string that depends on the value of `n` being even or odd.
- `x` is set to `n // 2` if `n % 2 == 0`, otherwise it is set to `n // 2 + 1`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will directly print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
