Postcondition: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx`, `res` is `res + 1`, and `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is incremented by 1. There is no change in the postcondition if the condition `a[mdx] == a[i]` is not met.
