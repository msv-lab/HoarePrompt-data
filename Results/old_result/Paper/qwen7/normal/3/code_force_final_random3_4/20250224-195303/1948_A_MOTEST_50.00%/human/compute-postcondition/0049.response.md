Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The loop condition is `j < n // 2`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1 more than its previous value.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `ans` is 0 plus 2 times `s[x]`.
   - `x` is 1.

3. **Determine the Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since the loop condition depends on `j` and `n`, these are the variables that need to be adjusted.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is one less than `n // 2` because the loop just finished executing.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and `j` must still be less than `n // 2`.

4. **Calculate the New Values:**
   - If `j` was one less than `n // 2` at the end of the previous iteration, then `j` should now be `n // 2 - 1`.
   - To allow the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `n // 2`.

5. **Adjust the Other Variables:**
   - `i`, `t`, `n`, `ans`, and `x` are not directly affected by the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1 more than its previous value, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is 0 plus 2 times `s[x]`, `x` is 1, `j` is `n // 2`**.
