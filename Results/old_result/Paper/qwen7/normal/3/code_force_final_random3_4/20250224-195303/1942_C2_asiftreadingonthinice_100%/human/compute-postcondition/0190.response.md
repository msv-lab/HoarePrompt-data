Output State: **`tmp` must contain at least one element, `i` is the first element of `tmp`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement simply indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `tmp` and `i` remain unchanged.
