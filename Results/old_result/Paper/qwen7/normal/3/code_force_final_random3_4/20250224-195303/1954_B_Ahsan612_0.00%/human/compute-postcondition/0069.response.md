Output State: **`i` is 6, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[6]`**

Explanation: The code `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of `ar[i]` to the variable `num`. Given that `i` is initially 6, `num` now holds the value of `ar[6]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 6. The value of `same` is also unchanged at 1 because the condition `ar[4] == num` was not met (since `num` is now `ar[6]` and `same` was initialized as 1 when `ar[4]` did not equal `num`).
