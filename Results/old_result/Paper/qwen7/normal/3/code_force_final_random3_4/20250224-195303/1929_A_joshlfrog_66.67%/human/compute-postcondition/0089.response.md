Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `l` remains unchanged, `y` is updated to the minimum value between `y` and `nums[i + 1]`, `e` remains `t`, `x` is equal to `nums[i]`**.

This means that the variable `x` now holds the value of `nums[i]`, while the other variables retain their previous states. Specifically, `i` has been incremented by 1, `l` remains the same as before, `y` is updated to be the smaller of its current value and `nums[i + 1]`, `e` stays as `t`, and `l` is still an input integer with `nums` being a list of integers created from user input.
