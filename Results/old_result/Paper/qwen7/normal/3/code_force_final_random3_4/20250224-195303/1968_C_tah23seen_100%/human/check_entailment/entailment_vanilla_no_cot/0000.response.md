Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The function `func_1` attempts to calculate `ans[i]` as `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. This approach does not guarantee that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` will hold true for all `2 \leq i \leq n`.

2. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation requires that `a_i` be greater than or equal to `a_{i-1}` and that `a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` equals `x_i`. The current implementation does not ensure these conditions are met.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that each `a_i` is chosen such that the modulo condition holds. One way to achieve this is to set `a_1` to a large value (e.g., 10^9) and then iteratively adjust subsequent values of `a_i` to satisfy the modulo conditions.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    ans[0] = 10 ** 9  # Start with a large value for a_1
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + arr[i - 1]
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**: Set `a_1` to a large value (10^9).
2. **Iterative Adjustment**: For each subsequent element `a_i`, set it to `a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}`. This ensures that `x_{i-1} = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}`.
3. **Output**: Print the resulting array `a`.

This approach guarantees that the modulo conditions are satisfied for all `2 \leq i \leq n`.
