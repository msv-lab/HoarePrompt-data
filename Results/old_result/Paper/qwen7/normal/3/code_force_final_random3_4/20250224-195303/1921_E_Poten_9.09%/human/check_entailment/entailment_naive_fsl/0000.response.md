Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the outcome of the game based on the given rules. Specifically, the program does not handle all possible scenarios correctly. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
1
3 3 1 1 3 3
```

According to the problem description:
- Alice starts at (1, 1).
- Bob starts at (3, 3).

The correct outcome should be "Alice" because Alice can move down-right to (2, 2), and then Bob cannot make a move without going out of bounds. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Draw" for this case.

This counterexample shows that the program does not handle the scenario where Alice can force a win by moving to a position from which Bob cannot make a valid move. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
