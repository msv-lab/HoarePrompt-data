Output State: The loop will have executed all its iterations, meaning `i` will be equal to `N-1`. For each element `a[i]` in the list `a`, the value of `cnt[a[i]]` will be incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `a[i]` in the list `a`. Therefore, `cnt` will contain the count of each integer present in the list `a`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `N` is the number of elements in the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `cnt` is a `defaultdict` where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
