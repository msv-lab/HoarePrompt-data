Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `n` is at least 2
   - `s` is the new string input by the user (this variable is not part of the loop head)
   - `mak` is `i` (this variable is not part of the loop head)
   - `pans` is a list containing the value `i` appended to itself if `s` equals '=', otherwise `pans` contains the value `i` (this variable is not part of the loop head)

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is `n + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `n + 2`.
   - `n` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` needs to be `n + 2`
   - `n` remains at least 2

6. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `s` and `mak` remain unchanged.
   - `pans` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is at least 2, `s` is the new string input by the user, `mak` is `i`, `pans` is a list containing the value `i` appended to itself if `s` equals '=', otherwise `pans` contains the value `i`**.
