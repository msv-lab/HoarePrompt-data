Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is set to `i_end + 2`, `a[j]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. The values of `n`, `i`, and `a[i]` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 0, `i` is still set to `i_end + 2`, and `a[j]` is incremented by 1.
