Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` must be greater than `l`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F` and `l` must be less than `h`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `mid_sum` the value of `D[mid] + f` and `mid_next_sum` the value of `D[mid + 1] + f`. The values of `mid`, `h`, `l`, and `f` remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition that `h` must be greater than `l` and that `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F` and `l` must be less than `h` still holds true.
