Output State: **`prev` is now equal to `curr`, `curr` is the first element of `nodes[s]` and must not be equal to `e`, `tree` contains the elements `s`, `curr`, and the new element added which is `nodes[curr][0]` (since `nodes[curr][0] == prev`), and `tree` has been appended with `nodes[curr][0]`.**

Explanation: The code `prev = curr` updates the value of `prev` to be the current value of `curr`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
