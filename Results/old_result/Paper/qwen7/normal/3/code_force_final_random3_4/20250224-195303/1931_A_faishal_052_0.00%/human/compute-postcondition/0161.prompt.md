You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        
        lex = int(input())
        
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        
        arr.append(lex)
        
        arr.sort()
        
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, printing 'a', 'b', and 'c' in sequence.
    #
    #Explanation: Given the loop runs three times as specified by `range(3)`, and each iteration processes the value of `lex` to form an array `arr` which is then sorted and printed. Regardless of the initial value of `lex` (as long as it's within the given constraints), the final sorted array `arr` will always be `[1, 26, lex]` after the operations inside the loop. When sorted, this array becomes `[1, 26, lex]` (assuming `lex` is less than or equal to 26). Converting these values to characters using `chr(arr[k] + 96)` results in 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Therefore, after all iterations, the loop prints 'a', 'b', and 'c' in sequence.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes two variables, `t` and `n`, where `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, and `n` is an integer within the range of 3 to 78. Based on these values, the function returns a specific output.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
