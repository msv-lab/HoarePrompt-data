Reasoning:
The provided function aims to find the maximum beauty of an array by calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. However, the current implementation only finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and calculates their difference. This approach is incorrect because the maximum beauty is actually achieved by sorting the array in either ascending or descending order and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Hereâ€™s why the current implementation is incorrect:
- The function only finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and computes their difference. This does not account for the arrangement of the array to maximize the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
- To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in either ascending or descending order. In both cases, the sum of the differences between consecutive elements will be the same.

Let's correct the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        # Sort the array to maximize the beauty
        nums.sort()
        
        beauty = 0
        for i in range(1, l):
            beauty += nums[i] - nums[i-1]
        
        print(beauty)
```

With this corrected version, the function sorts the array and then calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements, which correctly gives the maximum beauty of the array.

Correctness: **False**
