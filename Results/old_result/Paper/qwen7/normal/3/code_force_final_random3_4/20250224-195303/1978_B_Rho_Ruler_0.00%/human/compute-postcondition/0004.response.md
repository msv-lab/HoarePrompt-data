Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n`. `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b), `a` and `b` are positive integers representing the usual price and the modified price of the first k buns respectively, and `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of buns. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the calculated cost `ans` (which is `k * b + (n - k) * a`) is less than or equal to the total cost if all buns were priced at the higher of the two prices `a` or `b`, i.e., `n * max(a, b)`**.
