### Reasoning

The original program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incomplete Check for Second Row:**
   - The check `if b[-2] != '>'` is insufficient. It only checks the second last column and does not ensure the robot can reach the last column. This is a critical flaw because the robot needs to be able to move from the second last column to the last column.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Single Column Case:**
   - The condition `if n == 1` should not return 'YES' because the robot cannot move from `(1, 1)` to `(2, 1)` in a single column grid. The problem statement specifies that `n` is at least 2, so this condition is incorrect.

3. **Incorrect Path Checking:**
   - The logic for checking paths in the first and second rows is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the robot's movement considering both rows simultaneously. The original program incorrectly assumes that if there are no `<` arrows in the specified columns, the robot can always reach the target. However, this is not necessarily true because the robot must navigate through both rows correctly.

The corrected program provided in the analysis addresses these issues by simulating the robot's movement through both rows and ensuring it can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.

### Final Evaluation

Given the issues identified in the original program and the correctness of the provided corrected program, the original assessment was inaccurate.

**Final: False**
