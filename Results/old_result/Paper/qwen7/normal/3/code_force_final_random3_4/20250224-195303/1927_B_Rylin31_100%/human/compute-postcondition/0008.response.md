Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in array`. The key variables here are `j` and `array`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the character whose ASCII value is `s[j] + 97`.
   - `j` is increased by 1.
   - The value of `s[j]` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine the state needed for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be within the bounds of the array `array`.
   - After the previous iteration, `j` was increased by 1, so for the next iteration, `j` should be incremented again.
   - The value of `s[j]` should also be increased by 1 for the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `j` was increased by 1 in the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `j` should be `j + 2`.
   - The value of `s[j]` should be `s[j + 1] + 1` (since it was increased by 1 in the previous iteration).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `ans` remains the same as it is not directly affected by the loop head.
- `j` is increased by 1 again, so `j` becomes `j + 1`.
- The value of `s[j]` is increased by 1, so `s[j]` becomes `s[j + 1] + 1`.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `j` or `s[j]` from the previous iteration, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the character whose ASCII value is `s[j] + 97`, `j` is increased by 1, and `s[j]` is increased by 1**.

To be precise, if we denote the current value of `j` as `j_current`, then for the next iteration:
- `j` should be `j_current + 1`.
- `s[j]` should be `s[j_current + 1] + 1`.

Since we don't have the specific values, we can represent it as:
- `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the character whose ASCII value is `s[j + 1] + 97`.
- `j` is `j + 1`.
- `s[j]` is `s[j + 1] + 1`.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the character whose ASCII value is `s[j + 1] + 97`, `j` is `j + 1`, and `s[j]` is `s[j + 1] + 1`**.
