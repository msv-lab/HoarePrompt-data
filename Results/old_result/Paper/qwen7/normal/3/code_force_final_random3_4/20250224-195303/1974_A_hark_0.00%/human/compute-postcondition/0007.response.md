Output State: `t` is an integer greater than 0.

Explanation: Since the loop runs `t` times and `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), after all iterations of the loop, `t` will still be an integer greater than 0. The function `func_2()` is called in each iteration, but the value of `t` itself does not change within the loop. Therefore, regardless of how many times the loop runs, as long as it runs at least once, `t` will remain an integer greater than 0.
