### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into tokens.
   - It then processes each test case by extracting the necessary parameters and storing them in a list of tuples `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It creates a dictionary `residue_map` to store the frequency of `(r_x, r_y)` pairs.
   - For each element `num` in the array, it calculates `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.
   - It then checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` exists in `residue_map` and adds the corresponding count to `count`.
   - Finally, it updates the `residue_map` with the current `(num % x, num % y)` pair.

3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - The program correctly counts the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - The use of `residue_map` ensures that all possible pairs are considered without explicitly iterating through all pairs `(i, j)`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program appends the count of beautiful pairs for each test case to the `results` list and prints the results.

Given the annotations and the detailed explanation of the program's behavior, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. It efficiently processes multiple test cases and handles all described constraints and examples provided.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
