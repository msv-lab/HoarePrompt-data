Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: The loop variable.
   - `mdx`: The starting index of the loop.
   - `n`: The ending index of the loop.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs from `mdx` to `n` (inclusive). Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - `n` is an integer and `n` is not equal to 1.
   - `mdx < n`.
   - `res` is incremented by 1 if the value of `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since `i` starts from `mdx` and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `mdx + 1`.
   - The condition `mdx < n` must still hold true for the loop to continue.
   - `mdx` remains unchanged until the loop terminates or is explicitly modified within the loop body, but it does not change automatically with each iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but it does not change automatically with each iteration.
   - `res` will be incremented if `a[mdx] == a[i]` during the current iteration, but this does not affect the loop continuation condition.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be `mdx + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `mdx` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - The condition `mdx < n` must still be true for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, `n` is an integer and `n` is not equal to 1, and `mdx < n`**.
