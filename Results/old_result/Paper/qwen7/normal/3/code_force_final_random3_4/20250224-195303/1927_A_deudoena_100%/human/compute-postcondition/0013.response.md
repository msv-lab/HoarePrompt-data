Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'; `j` is the second character in the string `s`; `c` is 2**.

Explanation: The variable `c` was initially set to 1 and then incremented by 1, making its new value 2. The values of `s` and `j` remain unchanged from their initial state.
