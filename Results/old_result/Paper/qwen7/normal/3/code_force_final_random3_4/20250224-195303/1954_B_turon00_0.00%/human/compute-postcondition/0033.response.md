Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `tmp` will be equal to the first element of the list `a`, `cnt` will be the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a`, and `ans` will be updated to be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` for each iteration.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the list `a` using the index `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
- `tmp` is initialized to the first element of the list `a`.
- For each element in the list `a`, if the element is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is incremented by 1.
- If the element is not equal to `tmp`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is reset to 0.
- After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n` (since the loop increments `i` from `0` to `n-1`).
- `cnt` will hold the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found during the loop.
- `ans` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` for each iteration, effectively keeping track of the minimum length of consecutive sequences of `tmp` encountered.
