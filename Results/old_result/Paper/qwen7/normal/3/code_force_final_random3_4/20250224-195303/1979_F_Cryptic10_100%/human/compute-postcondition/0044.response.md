To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations described:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - The list `ops` has been fully processed in reverse order.
   - For each tuple `(v1, v2)` in `ops[::-1]`, if the last element of the first tuple (`p1[-1]`) is equal to `v2`, then `v1` will be appended to the first tuple. Otherwise, the first tuple remains unchanged.

2. **Effect of Processing**:
   - After processing all tuples in `ops[::-1]`, the first tuple in `ops` will have its last element updated as many times as there are tuples in `ops` where the condition `p1[-1] == v2` is met.
   - All other tuples in `ops` will remain unaltered.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)`.
   - Here, `p1` is the first tuple in `ops` after processing, and `p2` is the second tuple in `ops` after processing.
   - `p1[::-1]` reverses `p1`.
   - `map(str, ...)` converts each element in the concatenated list to a string.
   - `' '.join(...)` joins these strings with spaces.
   - The result is formatted as a string and printed with a leading `!`.

Given this breakdown, the output will be a string that starts with `!` followed by the reversed elements of the first tuple in `ops` after processing, followed by the elements of the second tuple in `ops` after processing, all separated by spaces.

Output: **! [reversed elements of the first tuple in ops after processing] [elements of the second tuple in ops after processing]**
