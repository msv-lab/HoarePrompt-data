Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length n+1, `b` is a list of length n+1, `xx` is a list containing all the strings `x` entered during the iterations of the loop, `j` is equal to `n`, `sa` is a list containing the elements `1` and possibly `3`, `sb` is a list containing the element `1` and `i`. If `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] > 0`, then `i` is added to `sb`; otherwise, `sb` remains as `[1]`.
