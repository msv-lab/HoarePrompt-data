Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is less than `n`, `arr` is a list containing 0, `maxi` is 3, `res` is an input string**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `res`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `total` remains 10, `i` is still less than `n`, `arr` contains 0, `maxi` is 3, and `res` is now set to the string input by the user.
