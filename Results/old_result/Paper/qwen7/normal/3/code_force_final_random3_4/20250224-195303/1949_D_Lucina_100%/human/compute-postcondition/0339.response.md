To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `xx` is a 2D list.
   - `i` is an index representing a specific row in the `xx` list.
   - `n` is an integer representing the number of columns minus one (since the range is `range(1, n+1)`).

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(nx)
   ```
   - `nx` is a string constructed based on the values in the 2D list `xx` from the row indexed by `i` and the columns indexed by `range(1, n+1)`.

Given this, `nx` will be a string that concatenates the values from the `i`-th row of `xx`, starting from the second column (index 1) up to the `n`-th column.

Since the exact values of `xx`, `i`, and `n` are not provided, we cannot give a precise numerical or textual value for `nx`. However, we can describe it based on the structure.

**Output:**
Output: **a string constructed from the values in the i-th row of xx, starting from the second column (index 1) up to the n-th column**
