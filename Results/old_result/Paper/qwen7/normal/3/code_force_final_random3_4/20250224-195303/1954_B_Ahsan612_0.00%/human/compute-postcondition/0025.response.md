Postcondition: `same` is either 2 or 3, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list `ar`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i + 1` must be less than `len(ar)`. If `ar[i]` equals `num`, then `same` remains either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `same` is set to 1, `minn` becomes the minimum of `minn` and `same`, and `num` is set to `ar[i]`.
