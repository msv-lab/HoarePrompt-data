Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, so `t` is now 0. `idx` is `idx + n` from the last iteration, where `n` is `int(data[idx])`. `a` is a list of integers created by mapping `int` over the slice of `data` from `idx` to `idx + n`. `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration, with a total of `t` elements. `data` remains unchanged throughout the process.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `t` is 0 because all iterations are done. `idx` points to the position right after the last list `a` was processed. `a` contains integers from the current position of `idx` to `idx + n`. `results` is a list of function outputs from each iteration of the loop, and `data` stays as it was initially.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is a non-empty list

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: - For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still be a non-empty list.
   - `result` will be set to the next element in the list.

### Conclusion:

Given that `results` is a non-empty list at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still be a non-empty list, and `result` will be set to the next element in the list.

### Final State:

State:

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: results must still be a non-empty list, and result will be set to the next element in the list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
