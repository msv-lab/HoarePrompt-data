Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `nums` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `nums` with `n` zeros. This means that `nums` now contains `n` elements, all set to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
