Output State: **`nodes[key]' is a list, and `ends` is a list with an additional element `key`.**

Explanation: The code `ends.append(key)` appends the value of `key` to the list `ends`. This operation does not change the value of `nodes[key]`, which remains a list. If the length of `nodes[key]` was exactly one before this operation, `ends` would already have an additional element `key`. Regardless of the initial state of `nodes[key]`, after executing the code, `ends` will have an additional element `key`.
