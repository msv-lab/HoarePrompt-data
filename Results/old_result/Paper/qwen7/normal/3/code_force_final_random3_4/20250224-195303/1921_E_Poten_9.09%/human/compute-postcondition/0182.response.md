Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test\_cases} \leq 10^4\), `i` is 3, `answers` is a list, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer**.

Explanation: The code reads a line of input using `input()` and splits it into a list of strings using `split(' ')`. Each string in the resulting list is then converted to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. This list of integers is assigned to the variable `clues`. The initial values of `test_cases` and `i` remain unchanged, and `answers` is still a list, though its content is now populated with the integers from the input.
