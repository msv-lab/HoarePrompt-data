Output State: **`empty` is True, `t` is an input integer, `u` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 × 10^5, and `edges` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `empty` is set to `True`, which does not affect the values of `t`, `u`, `v`, `n`, or `edges`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
