Based on the initial state provided, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, and they are determined by the first, second, and third integers entered, respectively. The expression to be evaluated and printed is `n // 2 * b + a`.

Let's break it down:

1. `n // 2`: This is integer division of `n` by 2. It will give the quotient without any decimal part.
2. `n // 2 * b`: This multiplies the result of the integer division by `b`.
3. `n // 2 * b + a`: Finally, this adds `a` to the result of the previous multiplication.

Given these steps, the expression `n // 2 * b + a` will be evaluated with the actual values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Output: **n // 2 * b + a (where n, a, and b are the first, second, and third integers entered, respectively)**
