Let's analyze the given state right before the `while True` loop and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.

### Given State:
- `vis` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1.
- `i` is equal to the length of `paths`.
- `k` is equal to the length of `paths`.
- `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`.
- `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the loop iterations.
- `ress` holds the final maximum value between all `curr` values.
- `pathb` contains all elements added until `vis[pb - 1] == 1`.
- `paths` is an empty list.
- `n` is an integer from the first input string.
- `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop.
- `ps` is the same as before.
- `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the first input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
- `vis[ps - 1]` is set to 1.

### Loop Head:
```
while True:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop is a `while True` loop, meaning it will always execute at least once without any condition check.
- There are no conditions in the loop head that would prevent the loop from executing the first time.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute the first time regardless of the current state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the given state for the loop to execute the first time.

### Final Answer:
State: **`vis` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1, `i` is equal to the length of `paths`, `k` is equal to the length of `paths`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the loop iterations, `ress` holds the final maximum value between all `curr` values, `pathb` contains all elements added until `vis[pb - 1] == 1`, `paths` is an empty list, `n` is an integer from the first input string, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop, `ps` is the same as before, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the first input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `vis[ps - 1]` is set to 1**
