Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range defined by `range(1, n + 1)`. This means `j` must be less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is 2.
   - `cntl[2]` is less than 2.
   - Either `c` is equal to the original value of `c` minus 1, or the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if either `c` is falsy or `j` equals `n`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 3 (since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n`).
   - The condition `cntl[2] < 2` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop increment.
   - The state of `c` and the conditions related to breaking out of the loop remain the same unless explicitly changed within the loop body.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 3.
   - `cntl[2]` remains less than 2.
   - The conditions related to `c` and the break statement remain the same.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`j` is 3, `cntl[2]` is less than 2, and either `c` is equal to the original value of `c` minus 1, or the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if either `c` is falsy or `j` equals `n`.**
