Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input split, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input split, `b` is a list of integers from the new input split, `len_a` is the length of list `a`, `len_b` is the length of list `b`.**

The code calculates the lengths of lists `a` and `b` and assigns these lengths to the variables `len_a` and `len_b`, respectively. The values of `a`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `b`, and the input operations remain unchanged.
