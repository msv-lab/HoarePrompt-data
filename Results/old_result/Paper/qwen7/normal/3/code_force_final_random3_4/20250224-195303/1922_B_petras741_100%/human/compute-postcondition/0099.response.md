Output State: **`eta_ln` must be at least 2, `j` is 1, `res` is increased by `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6`**.

This means that the value of `res` has been updated by adding `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6` to its current value. The precondition that `eta_ln` must be at least 2 and `j` is 1 remains unchanged.
