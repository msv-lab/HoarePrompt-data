Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is set to the integer value of the first space-separated token from `s`, `x` is set to the integer value of the second space-separated token from `s`, `a` is set to the integer value of the third space-separated token from `s`, `z` is equal to \(2 \times (k - 1) + (2 \times (k - 1)) // (k - 1) + 1\), `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `z` is updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Since `z` was initially set to `2 * (k - 1)`, substituting this into the equation gives `z += 2 * (k - 1) // (k - 1) + 1`. Given that `k` is an integer, `2 * (k - 1) // (k - 1)` simplifies to `2`, because the floor division of `2 * (k - 1)` by `(k - 1)` is `2`. Thus, `z` becomes `2 * (k - 1) + 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `2 * (k - 1) + 3`. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i` remain unchanged.
