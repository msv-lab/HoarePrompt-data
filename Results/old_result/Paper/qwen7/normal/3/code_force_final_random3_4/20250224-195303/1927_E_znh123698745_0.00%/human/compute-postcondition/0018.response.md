Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `answer` has an element appended which is `array[a[0]]`; `a[0]` is 1 (since `a[0] += 1` increments the value of `a[0]` from 0 to 1)**

Explanation: Initially, `a[0]` is 0. After executing `a[0] += 1`, the value of `a[0]` is incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
