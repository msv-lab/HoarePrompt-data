Based on the initial state provided:

- `input_value` is a positive integer.
- `l` is the first integer from the input split by space and converted to an integer.
- `r` is the second integer from the input split by space and converted to an integer.
- `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`.
- `s` is the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.
- `e` is the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.
- `arr` is a sorted list.
- `s` is now the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.
- `e` is now the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

This statement directly prints the values `-1` and `-1`. These values are not derived from any of the variables or objects described in the initial state but are hardcoded in the print statement itself.

Output: **-1 -1**
