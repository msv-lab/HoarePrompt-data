Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - It then reads `x` integers representing the chosen vertices.

2. **Processing Input:**
   - The program correctly extracts the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input.
   - It also correctly processes the list of `x` chosen vertices.

3. **Calculating Output:**
   - The program prints `x - 2` for each test case.

### Problem Description Recap
- **Objective:** Maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
- **Constraints:**
  - `n` is the number of sides of the polygon.
  - `x` is the number of vertices already chosen by Bessie.
  - `y` is the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose (in this version, `y = 0`).
- **Key Insight:** To maximize the number of triangular pieces, we need to use as many of the chosen vertices as possible to form triangles. Each set of 3 chosen vertices can form one triangle.

### Analysis of the Given Program
- The program correctly identifies the number of chosen vertices (`x`).
- However, the logic to calculate the maximum number of triangular pieces is flawed.
  - The formula `x - 2` is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the vertices must form triangles.
  - Specifically, for any set of 3 vertices, they can form one triangle. Therefore, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices is `x - 2` only if `x >= 3`. If `x < 3`, no triangles can be formed.

### Correct Logic
- If `x < 3`, the output should be `0` because no triangles can be formed.
- If `x >= 3`, the output should be `x - 2`.

### Revised Program
```python
def func():
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            arr = input().split()
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            if x < 3:
                print(0)
            else:
                print(x - 2)
```

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because it always prints `x - 2` without checking if `x` is at least 3. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
