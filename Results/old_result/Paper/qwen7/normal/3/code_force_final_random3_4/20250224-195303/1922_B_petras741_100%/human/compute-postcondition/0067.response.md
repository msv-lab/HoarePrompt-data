Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head defines the variables `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and is incremented within the loop, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` (which is now 1) must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `j` is 1; `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1**
