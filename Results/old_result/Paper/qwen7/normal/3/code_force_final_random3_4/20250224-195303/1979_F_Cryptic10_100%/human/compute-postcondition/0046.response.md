Output State: **`ops` will have been partially processed in reverse order, with the current tuple being the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`; `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive), and `ops` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code sets `vx` to be a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) and assigns an empty list to `ops`. The initial state of `ops` being partially processed in reverse order remains unchanged because no operations were performed on `ops` within the given code snippet.
