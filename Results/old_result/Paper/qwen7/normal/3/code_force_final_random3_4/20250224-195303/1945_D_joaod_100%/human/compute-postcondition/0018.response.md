Output State: **`total` is now equal to `best`, `na_frente` is the original value minus 2, `v` is the value of `na_frente` and decremented by 1, `best` is now equal to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` because `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is true, and `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` increments `total` by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Given the precondition, `best` was previously set to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` because `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` was true. After executing the code, `total` becomes `best`, and all other variables remain unchanged as per the precondition.
