Postcondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. After the execution of the if else block, if t equals 0, n and x are integers, and arr is a list of integers where each element is the integer conversion of the corresponding element in the input string split by spaces. Otherwise, t is still a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and no changes are made to n, x, or arr.**
