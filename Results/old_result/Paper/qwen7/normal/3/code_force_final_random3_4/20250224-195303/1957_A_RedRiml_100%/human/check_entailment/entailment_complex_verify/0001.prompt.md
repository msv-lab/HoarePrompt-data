You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the lengths of the sticks a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        pl = []
        
        d = {}
        
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        
        shapes = 0
        
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: The final value of `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all unique elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3 after all iterations of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves an integer `t` indicating the number of sticks, followed by `t` integers representing the lengths of the sticks. It calculates and prints the total number of shapes that can be formed, where each shape requires at least three sticks of the same length. The final state of the program is the output of the total number of such shapes for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `w` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` which represents the number of sticks.
   - It then reads a list of stick lengths `palka`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - A dictionary `d` is used to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - An array `pl` is used to store unique stick lengths.

3. **Calculating Maximum Polygons:**
   - For each unique stick length in `pl`, the program checks if there are at least 3 sticks of that length.
   - If so, it calculates how many polygons can be formed using those sticks (i.e., `d[j] // 3`).
   - The total number of polygons `shapes` is accumulated.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of polygons for each test case.

### Issues Identified

1. **Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that iterates `w` times.
   - However, the variable names (`w`, `ln`, `palka`) are not descriptive and could be improved for clarity.

2. **Polygon Formation Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the number of polygons is correct. Each unique stick length can form polygons as long as there are at least 3 sticks of that length.
   - The division by 3 is appropriate because each polygon must have at least 3 sides.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles cases where no polygons can be formed (e.g., when all stick counts are less than 3).
   - The program also correctly handles cases where some stick counts are exactly 3 (e.g., forming one triangle).

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic is sound and correctly implements the required functionality. There are no apparent issues or errors in the code that would cause it to produce incorrect results based on the problem description.
