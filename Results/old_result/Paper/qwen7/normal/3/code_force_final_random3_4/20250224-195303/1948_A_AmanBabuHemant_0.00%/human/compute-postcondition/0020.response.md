Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `s` is '110' repeated `n//2` times with a length of either less than 200 or exactly 200.**

Explanation: The code `s = '110' * (n // 2)` assigns the string `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times to the variable `s`. The conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, and `s` is constructed as described.
