You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the provided function signature. However, based on the problem description, the interaction involves querying indices and comparing bitwise OR results to deduce the maximum XOR pair. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, and the interaction rules are specified for querying and answering.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        maxi = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                maxi = i
        
        arr = [0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                arr = [i]
            elif res == '=':
                arr.append(i)
        
        mini = arr[0]
        
        for item in arr[1:]:
            print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '>':
                mini = item
        
        print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
        
    #State: `mini` is the smallest integer from 0 to `n-1`, `maxi` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1`, and `res` is an input string which is either '<' or '='.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and interacts with an external system to query indices and compare bitwise OR results to deduce the maximum XOR pair across multiple test cases. Each test case involves a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. The function processes these permutations and returns the result of finding the maximum XOR pair for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
