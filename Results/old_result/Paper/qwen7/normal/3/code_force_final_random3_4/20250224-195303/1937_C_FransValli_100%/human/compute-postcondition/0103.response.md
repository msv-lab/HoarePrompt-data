Output State: **`mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is 0, `maxi` is 0, and `res` is the final input string from the user.**

Explanation: Given the initial state and the code snippet, the array `arr` is initialized with a single element `[0]`. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `n-1`, decrementing `i` by 1 after each iteration. Since `arr` only has one element, `n` is 1, and thus `maxi` starts at `n-1`, which is `0`.

Inside the loop, the condition `res == '<'` is checked. Since `res` is set to '<' at least once (as per the provided states), `maxi` will be set to `i` when this condition is met. However, since `i` starts at 1 and decrements, the first time `i` is 0, the condition will no longer be met, and the loop will terminate. At this point, `i` becomes 0, and `maxi` remains 0 because `i` was never decremented below 0 during the loop.

The other variables (`mini` and `res`) retain their initial or updated values as described. `mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, which is `0`, and `res` is the final input string from the user.
