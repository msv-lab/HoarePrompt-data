Output State: `max_diff` is the maximum difference found between consecutive elements in the list `A` from index 1 to `n-1`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found under the same conditions, `index` is the index where `max_diff` was found, and `i` is `n`. `diff` is the last calculated difference `A[n-1] - A[n-2]`.

In more detail:
- `max_diff` will hold the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `A` starting from the second element.
- `next_max_diff` will hold the second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `A` starting from the second element.
- `index` will be the index of the element where `max_diff` was found.
- `i` will be `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- `diff` will be the difference between the last two elements of the list `A` (i.e., `A[n-1] - A[n-2]`).
