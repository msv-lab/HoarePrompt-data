Output State: **`q` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, and the values of `x` and `y` are assigned the integers entered by the user.**

The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial values of `q`, `x`, and `y` are updated with the values entered by the user, while the condition for the output ('NO' or 'YES') remains to be determined based on further code execution.
