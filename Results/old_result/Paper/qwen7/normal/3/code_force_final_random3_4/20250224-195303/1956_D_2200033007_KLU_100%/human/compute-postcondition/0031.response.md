Output State: **`is_already_stairs` remains False, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `res` is a list that will store the operations performed, and for every `j` in the range `0` to `17`, the condition `arr[start_index + j] == j` still does not hold true. Additionally, `arr[start_index + i] != i`. `res` now contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` as a new element.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` to the list `res`. This means that the list `res` now includes this new tuple, while all other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
