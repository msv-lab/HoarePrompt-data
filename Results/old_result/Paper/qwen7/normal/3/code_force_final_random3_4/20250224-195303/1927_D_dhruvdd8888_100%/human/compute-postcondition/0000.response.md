Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n; `input` is now set to `sys.stdin.readline`**.

This code simply changes the method used for taking input from standard input to `sys.stdin.readline`. It does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, or the structure of the queries. Therefore, the values and constraints of these variables remain the same, and only the method for input is updated.
