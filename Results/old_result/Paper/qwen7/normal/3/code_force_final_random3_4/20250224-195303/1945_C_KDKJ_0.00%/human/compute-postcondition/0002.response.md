Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key variables here are the input value that determines the number of iterations and the loop counter (which is `_` in this case, but it doesn't matter since it's an underscore).

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `func_1()` has been called. This means that `func_1()` was executed during the previous iteration.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as the user inputs a positive integer. The loop counter is incremented with each iteration, but the actual condition for the loop to continue is based on the input value.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the user must input a positive integer. Therefore, the state needs to reflect that the input has been taken and is valid for another iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should include the fact that `func_1()` has been called again and that the input has been taken, indicating that the loop can continue.

**State: **`func_1()` has been called, the input is a positive integer**
