Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `j` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, and the element at index `j-1` in the list `xx[i]` is `'?'`. Additionally, `i` is not in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` and `j` is not in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. This changes the value of `nx` from whatever it was previously to `nx + 'F'`. The other conditions and values of the variables `j`, `n`, `xx[i][j-1]`, `i`, and `sb` remain unchanged as per the precondition.
