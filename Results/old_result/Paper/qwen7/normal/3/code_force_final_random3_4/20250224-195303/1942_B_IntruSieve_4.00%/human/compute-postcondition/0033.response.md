Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, `minn` and `mex` are updated based on the value of `arr[i + 1]`. If `arr[i] > 0`, then `minn` is `maxx + 1` and `mex` is now equal to `minn`. If `minn` equals `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1` and `mex` is set to `minn`. If `arr[i] <= 0`, then `mex` is appended with the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`. If the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to this new value. Otherwise, `maxx` remains unchanged.
