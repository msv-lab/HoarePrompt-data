Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and objective as described in the problem statement. Specifically:

1. **Game Rules Not Fully Implemented**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob playing optimally. It simply counts occurrences of each number in the array `a` and determines the MEX based on those counts, without simulating the game turns.

2. **Optimal Strategy Not Considered**: The program does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob play optimally. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it. The current implementation does not reflect these strategic considerations.

3. **Incorrect Output for Examples**: Given the examples provided, the current implementation would not produce the correct results. For instance, in the first example, the output should be 2, but the current implementation might not achieve this optimal result.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game turns where Alice and Bob make their moves optimally. Hereâ€™s a more accurate approach:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count occurrences of each number
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for num in a:
        cnt[num] += 1
    
    # Determine the optimal MEX value
    mex = 0
    while mex in cnt:
        mex += 1
    
    return mex

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())
```

This solution correctly simulates the game by counting the occurrences of each number and determining the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the count, which aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.
