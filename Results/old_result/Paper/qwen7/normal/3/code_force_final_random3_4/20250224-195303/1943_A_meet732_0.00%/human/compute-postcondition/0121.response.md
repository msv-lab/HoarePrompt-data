Output State: **`j` is 2, `cntl[2]` is less than 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no explicit loop or conditional block shown in the code snippet, the `break` statement indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or conditional context. The values of `j`, `cntl[2]`, and `n` remain unchanged.
