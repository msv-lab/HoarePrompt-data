Postcondition: `c` is incremented by 1, `k` is incremented by 1, and `k` is still less than `n - 1`. If `s[k]` equals 'L', then `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[c]` is set to `ans % m % MOD`, and `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is set to `ans % m % MOD`, and `r` is decremented by 1.
