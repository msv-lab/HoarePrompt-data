Postcondition: `flag` is an integer, `i` is 29, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is either '0' or '1'. If `flag` is 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` remains '1'. If `flag` is non-zero and the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', the character at index `i` of string `s` is set to '0'.
