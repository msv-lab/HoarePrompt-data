Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and the array is beautiful. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    same = 1
    num = ar[0]
    minn = inf
    i = 1
    while i < len(ar):
        if ar[i] == num:
            same += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            num = ar[i]
            minn = min(minn, same)
            same = 1
        i += 1
    minn = min(minn, same)
    if minn == inf:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last element in the list `ar`. If `minn` is infinity, then `minn` remains infinity. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum value found among the counts of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, and `num` is the last element of `ar`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `same` is 1, and `num` is the last element of `ar` if it was not equal to the previous `num` when the loop ended, otherwise, `same` can take any value from 1 to the maximum value of `same` observed during the loop. If `minn` was initially infinity, it remains unchanged; otherwise, `minn` is now a finite value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `minn` is the minimum value between 1 and 2, which remains 1, `same` is 2, `num` is the last number in the sequence, `ar` contains the first 6 integers from the input, `i` is 6, and `len(ar)` is 6. If `minn` is infinity, the function does nothing. Otherwise, `minn` is not infinity.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
