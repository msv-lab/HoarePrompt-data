Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `len(a)` must be greater than 0, `tmp` will be a list containing elements that satisfy the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` when `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, `ans` will be the count of consecutive elements with a difference of 2 plus the count of pairs of elements with an even difference that is not 2, and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2.**
