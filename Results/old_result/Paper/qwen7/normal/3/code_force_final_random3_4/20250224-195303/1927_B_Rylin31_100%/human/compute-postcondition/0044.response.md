Output State: **`array` must contain at least one element; `ans` is `ans` plus the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the character whose ASCII value is `s[j] + 97`. The initial state of `array` is unchanged, and `ans` is updated based on the current value of `s[j]`. Since `s[j]` is not specified, we express the updated value of `ans` in terms of its original value and the new character added.
