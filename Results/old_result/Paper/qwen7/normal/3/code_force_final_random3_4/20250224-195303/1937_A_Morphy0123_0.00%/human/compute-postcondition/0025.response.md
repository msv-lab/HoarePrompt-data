Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n_cases)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n_cases`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n_cases`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is either 1 or 4
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `power` is 4
   - `n` must be greater than 8 if `i` is 4, otherwise `power` is not equal to `n`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` can be either 1 or 4, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n_cases`, let's consider both possibilities for `i`:
     - If `i` is 1, then `i + 1` (which is 2) must be less than `n_cases` for the loop to execute again.
     - If `i` is 4, then `i + 1` (which is 5) must be less than `n_cases` for the loop to execute again.

5. **Ensure `n_cases` is consistent**:
   - Since `i` can be either 1 or 4, and for the loop to execute again, `n_cases` must be greater than the maximum possible value of `i + 1`, which is 5.

6. **Final state adjustment**:
   - `t` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 5.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was 1, it becomes 2; if `i` was 4, it becomes 5.
   - `n` and `power` remain the same as they are not affected by the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` must be greater than 5, `i` is either 2 or 5, `n` is an input integer, `power` is 4, and `n` must be greater than 8 if `i` is 5, otherwise `power` is not equal to `n`.**
