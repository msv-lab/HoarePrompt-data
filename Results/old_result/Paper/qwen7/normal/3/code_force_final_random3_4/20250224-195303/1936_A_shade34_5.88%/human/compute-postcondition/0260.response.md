Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \). For each test case, it queries the relative order of elements in the permutation using a series of comparison operations. After determining the relative order, it outputs two indices: one corresponding to \( 2n - 1 \) and another to \( n - 1 \), effectively providing a summary of the permutation's structure.**
