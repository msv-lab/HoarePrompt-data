Output State: `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found during the iterations, `best_y` is the corresponding `y` value that maximizes `gcd_val + y`, and both `x` and `y` have completed all their iterations as defined in the loop. The `gcd_val` and `current_sum` will reflect the last iteration's values where the condition `current_sum > max_sum` was last checked and either updated `max_sum` and `best_y` or remained unchanged.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `max_sum` will hold the highest sum of `gcd_val + y` encountered, `best_y` will be the `y` value that produced this maximum sum, and `x` and `y` will have gone through all possible values within the specified range without breaking out of the loop early.
