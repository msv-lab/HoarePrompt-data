Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate participants based on their preferences.
2. The given code correctly handles the logic for determining the number of tents required for each test case.
3. The code checks if it's possible to accommodate all participants based on the given constraints.
4. The logic for calculating the number of tents is as follows:
   - Each introvert needs a separate tent, contributing `a` tents.
   - Extroverts prefer to share a tent with two others, and universals can share a tent with anyone. Therefore, the maximum number of extroverts and universals that can share a tent is 3.
   - The code correctly calculates the number of full tents that can be formed from `b` extroverts and `c` universals (`(b + c) // 3`).
   - If there are remaining extroverts or universals that cannot form a complete tent, an additional tent is needed (`if (b + c) % 3 != 0: k += 1`).
5. The code handles the edge case where it's impossible to accommodate all participants, printing `-1` in such cases.
6. The overall structure and logic of the code align with the problem statement and the provided examples.

Given the above analysis, the code appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
