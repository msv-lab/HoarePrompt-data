Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - If \((-1)^i\) equals -1, then `answer` is the element at index `a[-2]` of `array`.
   - Otherwise, `a[0]` is increased by 1, and `answer` now contains the element `array[a[0]]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - From the initial state, `i` is currently 1.

4. **Next Value of `i`:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.

5. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - We need to update the value of `i` to 2.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 1 and no information suggests it changes, we keep `n` as greater than 1.
   - No other variables are directly affected by the loop head itself.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
