Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - i`, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move directly to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `n`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, and `rsum`, their values remain unchanged. The condition `(left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum)` is still true, and the loop continues based on this condition.
