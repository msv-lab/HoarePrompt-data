Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input. Regardless of the condition, the postcondition remains unchanged, meaning the condition \(2a < b\) does not affect the values of the variables.**
