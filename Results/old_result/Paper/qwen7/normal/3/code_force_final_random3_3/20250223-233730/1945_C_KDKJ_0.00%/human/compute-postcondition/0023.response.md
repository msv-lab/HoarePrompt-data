Postcondition: **`a` is a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1', but one character shorter than before; `S` is a list containing two lists `[x, y]` and `[x+1, y+1]`; either `x` is increased by 1 if the last character of `a` is '0', or `y` is increased by 1 if the first character of `a` is '1'.**
