Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or ['Draw', 'Bob'], `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces. The first clue is not equal to 1, the third clue is less than or equal to the fifth clue, and either both the third and fifth clues are even numbers or both are odd numbers. Additionally, the third clue is not equal to the fifth clue. Depending on the condition inside the if statement, `answers` will either contain 'Draw' or 'Bob'. If the absolute difference between the third and fifth clues is greater than 1, `answers` is set to either ['Draw'] or ['Bob']. Otherwise, `answers` is determined based on whether `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`.
