Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `tmp` has some value, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0**

Explanation: The code sets `cnt` to 0. Since `cnt` was previously equal to the minimum value between its current value and `ans`, setting `cnt` to 0 also means that `ans` is now 0. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `tmp`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
