Output: **YES**

Explanation: Based on the initial state provided, `j` is 0 and `n` is 1. The condition states that the character at index `j` of string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` of string `s`. Substituting the values of `j` and `n` into this condition, we get the character at index 0 of string `s` is not equal to the character at index `1 - 1 - 0` of string `s`, which simplifies to the character at index 0 of string `s` is not equal to the character at index 0 of string `s`. This condition cannot be true because any character is always equal to itself. However, the problem statement guarantees that this condition is met, implying there might be a special case or an error in the interpretation of the condition. Despite this, the print statement simply outputs 'YES', which is explicitly stated in the code snippet.
