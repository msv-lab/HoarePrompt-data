Postcondition: `done` is `True`, `i` is `0`, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with the first character assigned to `x`, `n` is `1`, `count` is `0`, `count2` is either `0` or `1`, `j` is `0`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than `1`, `count` is incremented by `1`. Otherwise, `count2` is incremented by `1`.
