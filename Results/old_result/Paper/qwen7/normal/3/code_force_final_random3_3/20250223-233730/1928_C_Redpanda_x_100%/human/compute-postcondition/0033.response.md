Output State: **`prime_to_i` is equal to 1, factors is a dictionary that must contain the key `prime`, and the value associated with `prime` is decreased by the factor, and a value equal to `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded.**

Explanation: The code `yield factor * prime_to_i` yields a value which is the product of `factor` and `prime_to_i`. Since `prime_to_i` is equal to 1, the yielded value is simply `factor`. However, the original values of `prime_to_i` and the dictionary `factors` remain unchanged. The dictionary `factors` must contain the key `prime`, and its value is decreased by the factor.
