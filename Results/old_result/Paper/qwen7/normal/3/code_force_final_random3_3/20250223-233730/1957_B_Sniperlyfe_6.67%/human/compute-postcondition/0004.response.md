Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `k` is `k - (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
   - `n` must be a positive integer.
   - `nums` is a list with its first element set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `k` is not directly relevant to the loop condition but might change inside the loop body. However, since we are only adjusting the state for the next iteration, we don't need to change `k` here.
   - `n` must remain a positive integer, and it does not change based on the loop head variables alone.
   - The list `nums` is not directly involved in the loop condition, so its state remains unchanged.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to 2.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 2, `k` is `k - (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, `n` must be a positive integer, `nums` is a list with its first element set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`**
