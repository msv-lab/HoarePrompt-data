Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `N` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers with an additional element -1 appended to it, `s` is 4, `e` is 0, `num` is the value of `nums[3]`, `arr` is a list containing two tuples [(3, 4, num), (1 + s, i, num)] if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, and `i` is 4.**

Explanation: The line `s = i` updates the value of `s` to be the current value of `i`, which is 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
