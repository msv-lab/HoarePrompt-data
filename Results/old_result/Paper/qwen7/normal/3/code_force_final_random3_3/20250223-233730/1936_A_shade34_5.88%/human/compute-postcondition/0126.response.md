Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `k + 1`
- `n` must be greater than `n-1`, but this condition seems redundant since `n` is just `n-1 + 1` which is always true.
- `mak` is `n-1`
- `mak2` is `n-1`
- `pans` is a list containing the element `k + 1`
- The new string `s` is either equal to '<' or '=' but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

From the initial state:
- `mak` and `mak2` both have the value `n-1`.
- `i` is `k + 1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **? n-1 n-1 k+1 n-1**
