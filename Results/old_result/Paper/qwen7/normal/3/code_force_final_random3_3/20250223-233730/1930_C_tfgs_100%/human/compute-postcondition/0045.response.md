Postcondition: `cur` is reduced by `adv`, `cnt` is reduced by `adv - counter[a[adv]]`, `ans` contains `n - 1` elements each calculated as `a[adv - 1] - (adv - 1 - j)`, `a` remains unchanged, `j` is `adv - 1 - (a[i - 1] - (j + 2) - 1)`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur) - adv`, and `cnt` is `cnt - adv`.

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `cur` and `cnt` are reduced accordingly, `ans` is updated based on the value of `i`, `j` and `adv` are recalculated, and `a` remains unchanged.
