Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `j` is `n + r + 2`, which simplifies to `2n + 2`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop. The value of `r` is `n`. The value of `t` is reduced by `n` for each iteration, so after `n` iterations, `t` will be `t - n * n`. The value of `i` is `n` after the loop completes.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `j` will be `2n + 2`, `n` will remain the same, `r` will be `n`, `t` will be reduced by `n squared`, and `i` will be `n`.
