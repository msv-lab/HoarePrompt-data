Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `nx` is 'F', `n` is a positive integer, `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', and either `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after executing this line, `nx` becomes 'F'. All other variables (`i`, `j`, `n`, and `xx[i][j - 1]`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
