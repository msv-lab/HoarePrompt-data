Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `count`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `x` is a character
- `count` is greater than 0
- `done` remains unchanged
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `done` becomes True

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the string `'YES'` without any conditions affecting it.

Output: **YES**
