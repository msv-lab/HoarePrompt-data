You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

        m = min(a)
        ans = 0
        if k >= n * m:
            ans = math.factorial(n)
        else:
            k -= n * m
            for i in range(n):
                a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
                k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
            ans = a[0]
            for i in range(1, n):
                ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates and prints a value based on the following conditions:
- If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m` (where `m` is the minimum value in `a`), it returns the factorial of `n`.
- Otherwise, it adjusts the values in `a` to satisfy certain constraints and then computes the product of the differences between consecutive elements in the modified list `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list `a` of size `n`.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - `m` is set to the minimum value in the list `a`.
   - `ans` is initialized to 0.

3. **Case 1: `k` is Sufficient to Buy All Minimum Cards:**
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, it means we can buy enough cards to ensure each type has at least `m` cards.
   - In this case, the answer is `math.factorial(n)` because we can rearrange the cards to form all possible permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

4. **Case 2: `k` is Not Sufficient to Buy All Minimum Cards:**
   - If `k` is less than `n * m`, we need to adjust the counts in `a` to maximize the number of valid subarrays.
   - We subtract `n * m` from `k` since we can already buy `n * m` cards with the current budget.
   - For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - Calculate the required additional cards needed to make the count at least `m + k // n`.
     - Update `a[i]` to be `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
     - Decrease `k` by the amount added to `a[i]`.

5. **Calculating the Final Answer:**
   - After adjusting the counts, `ans` is set to `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent element `a[i]` (from index 1 to `n-1`), multiply `ans` by `a[i] - a[i-1]` to compute the product of differences, which represents the number of valid subarrays.

### Correctness Check

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where `k` is sufficient to buy all minimum cards (`k >= n * m`).
  - The program correctly adjusts the counts when `k` is insufficient to buy all minimum cards.
  - The logic for updating `a[i]` and calculating `ans` seems correct for maximizing the number of valid subarrays.

- **Mathematical Accuracy:**
  - The use of `math.factorial(n)` is correct for the case where `k` is sufficient.
  - The loop for adjusting `a[i]` and calculating `ans` appears to be logically sound.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
