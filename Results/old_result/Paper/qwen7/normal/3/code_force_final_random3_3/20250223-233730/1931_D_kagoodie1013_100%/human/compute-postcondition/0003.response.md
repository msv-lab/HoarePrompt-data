Output State: **`test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `residue_map`. This does not affect the values of `test_cases`, `results`, or `count`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
