Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is assigned the value of `count`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `x` is a character.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- The variable `done` remains unchanged.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.

From the information given, we know:
- `string` is a sequence of characters.
- `j` is the value of `count`, which is greater than 0.
- Therefore, `string[:j]` will be the substring of `string` from the start up to but not including the `j`-th character.
- `string[j:]` will be the substring of `string` starting from the `j`-th character to the end.

Given this, the print statement will output two substrings of `string` separated by a space.

Output: **string[:count] string[count:]**
