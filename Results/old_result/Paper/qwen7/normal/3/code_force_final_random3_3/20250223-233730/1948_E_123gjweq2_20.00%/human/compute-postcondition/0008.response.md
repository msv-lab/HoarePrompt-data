Output State: **`mid` must be greater than 0; `cliquess[left + i]` is equal to `small_element + i`; `arr[left + i]` is equal to `small_element + i`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `arr[left + i]` to `small_element + i`. Since `cliquess[left + i]` was previously equal to `cliquess[left + 1]` and `arr[left + i]` was previously equal to `arr[left + 1]`, both `cliquess[left + i]` and `arr[left + i]` are now equal to `small_element + i`. The condition that `mid` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
