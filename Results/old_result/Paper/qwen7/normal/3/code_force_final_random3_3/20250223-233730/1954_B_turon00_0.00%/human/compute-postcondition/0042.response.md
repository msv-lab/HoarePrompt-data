Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, where `cnt` is 0. This means `ans` will be 0 if it was greater than 0, otherwise, it remains unchanged.
- `i` is equal to `n`, but since `n` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `i`.
- `t` is `t-1`, but since `t` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `t`.
- `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, but the specific values are not provided.
- `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, so `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`.
- `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`.

The print statement is simply `print(-1)`. Therefore, regardless of the values of other variables, the output will be `-1`.

Output: **-1**
