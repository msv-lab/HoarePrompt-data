Output: **YES**

Explanation: Based on the initial state provided, the variables `j`, `n`, `done`, and `count` have specific values. However, the print statement simply outputs the string 'YES', regardless of the values of the other variables. Since no conditions within the code snippet alter the output of the print statement, it will print 'YES'.
