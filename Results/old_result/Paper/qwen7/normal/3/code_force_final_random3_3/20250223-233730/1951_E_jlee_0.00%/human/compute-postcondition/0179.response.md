Postcondition: `done` is `True`, `i` is `0`, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with the first character assigned to `x`, `n` is `1`, `count` is `0`, `count2` is either `0` or `1`, `j` is `0`. If `count2` is greater than `0` and less than `count`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, if `count2` is equal to `count` or `count` is greater than `1`, the most internal loop or if statement is also exited.
