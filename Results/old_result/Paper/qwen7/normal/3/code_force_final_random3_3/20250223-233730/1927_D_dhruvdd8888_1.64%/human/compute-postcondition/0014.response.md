Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` is between 2 and 200000 inclusive; `s` is 0; `arr` contains one element (1 + s, 0, num); `num` is equal to `nums[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `num = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `num`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `num` is assigned the value of `nums[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
