Reasoning:
The given program attempts to find the maximum beauty of the array by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. However, the problem requires maximizing the sum of differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. The current implementation does not achieve this goal; instead, it calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the entire array, which is not the same as maximizing the sum of consecutive differences.

To correctly solve the problem, we should sort the array and calculate the sum of differences between consecutive elements after sorting. Sorting ensures that the largest and smallest elements are placed at the ends, maximizing the positive differences while minimizing the negative ones.

Given the provided execution summary, the program's logic is incorrect because it does not follow the required approach to maximize the beauty of the array.

Correctness: **False**
