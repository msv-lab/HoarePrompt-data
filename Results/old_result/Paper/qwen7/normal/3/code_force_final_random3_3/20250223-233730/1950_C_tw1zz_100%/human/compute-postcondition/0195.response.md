Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of the input split by ':', `m` is the minute part of the input split by ':', `h1` is '', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is 'AM' if `h` is "10" or "11", and 'PM' if `h` is "17", and the input value for the next iteration is `int(input()) - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `h1, m1 = '', m` updates the variable `h1` to an empty string and assigns the value of `m` to `m1`. The values of `s`, `t`, `h`, `m`, `time`, and the input value for the next iteration remain unchanged.
