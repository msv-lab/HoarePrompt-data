Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `done` remains `False`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is an index within the string such that `j + 1` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, `count` is now 0, `count2` is 0, `s` is a list representation of the string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first element of the list `s`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `done` remains `False`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is either 0 or 1, `count` is either 0 or greater than 1, `count2` is either 1 or equal to `count`, `s` is a list representation of the string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first element of the list `s`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then `done` becomes `True` if `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`; otherwise, `count2` is equal to `count`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `done` remains `False`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is either 0 or 1, `count` is either 0 or equal to `j`, `count2` is either 1, 2, or equal to `count`, `s` is a list representation of the string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first element of the list `s`, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `count2 > 0` and `count2 < count` or `count2 == count` or `count2 > count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `done` remains `False` or becomes `True`, `i` is incremented by 1 (new value is `i_new`), `j` is the next value in the sequence (either 0 or 1), `count` is equal to `j`, `count2` is either 1, 2, or equal to `count`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`, no change occurs; if `count2` equals `count`, `done` remains `False` and `count2` is reset to 0; if `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` becomes `True` and the loop or if statement is exited. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
