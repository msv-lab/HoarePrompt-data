Output State: **`shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`, `pl` must have at least one element, and the current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The variable `shapes` is incremented by the integer division of `d[j]` by 3. The precondition that `pl` must have at least one element and the current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3 remains unchanged.
