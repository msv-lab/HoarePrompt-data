Output State: `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for each iteration of the loop from `j = adv` down to `j = 0`. Specifically, since `adv` is initially set to `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)` and `i` is 2, the loop will run `adv` times, appending `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to `ans` for each `j` in the range from `adv - 1` down to `0`.

Given that `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order where each element `a[j]` is equal to `n - j`, and considering the initial conditions provided, the final `ans` will contain `adv` elements, each calculated as `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for decreasing values of `j` starting from `adv - 1` down to `0`.
