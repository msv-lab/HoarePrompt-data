Output State: **`k` is `s` split and converted to int and decreased by 2, `x` is the second value of `s` split and converted to int and must be greater than `k - 3`, `a` is the third value of `s` split and converted to int, `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` and then increased by itself divided by `k - 1` plus 1.**

In more detail, the value of `z` has been updated twice: first by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1`, and then again by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1`. Therefore, the final value of `z` is its original value plus twice the value of `z // (k - 1) + 1`.
