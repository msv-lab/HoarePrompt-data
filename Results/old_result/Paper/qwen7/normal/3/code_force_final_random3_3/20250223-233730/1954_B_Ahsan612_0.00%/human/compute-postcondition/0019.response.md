Output State: **`i` is 3, `same` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `ar[3]` equals `num` or not, `num` is either the first element of the list `ar` or the third element of the list `ar`, `minn` is either infinity or 1, and `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `same`, `num`, `minn`, and the list `ar` remain unchanged from their initial states.
