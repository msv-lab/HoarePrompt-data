Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n + 1):` will start with `i = 1` and increment `i` until `i` reaches `n + 1`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be at least 1, and `n` must be at least 1 (since the range starts from 1).

3. **Check the Given State**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\).
   - `a` is a list of length \(n + 1\) filled with zeros.
   - `b` is a list of length \(n + 1\) filled with zeros.
   - `xx` is a list containing a single empty string.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `n` is already given as an integer between 2 and 24, it satisfies the condition for the loop to start.
   - The initial value of `i` should be set to 1 for the loop to begin.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `i` to 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24**
