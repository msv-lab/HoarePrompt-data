Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ t**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer. This integer is stored in the variable `n`. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 remains unchanged. Additionally, the input for `n` must be a non-negative integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ t.
