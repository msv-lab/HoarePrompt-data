Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(a)`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `len(a)` is at least 1
   - `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is either equal to 2 or not equal to 2.
   - If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is equal to 2, then `ans` is 1.
   - If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2, then `tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if `(a[i] - a[i - 1])` is even, otherwise `tmp` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
   - `len(a)` remains the same (at least 1).
   - The condition `a[i] - a[i - 1]` will be checked with `i` now being 2, so it will check `a[2] - a[1]`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` and the condition for the new value of `i`.

**State: **`i` is 2, `len(a)` is at least 1, and `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is either equal to 2 or not equal to 2. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is equal to 2, then `ans` is 1. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2, then `tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if `(a[i] - a[i - 1])` is even, otherwise `tmp` remains unchanged.**
