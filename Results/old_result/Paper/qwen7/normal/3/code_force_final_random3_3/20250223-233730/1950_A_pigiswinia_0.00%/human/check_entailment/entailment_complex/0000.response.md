Reasoning:
- The program correctly defines the function `func()` which processes the test cases.
- It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
- For each test case, it reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) and checks the conditions to determine if the numbers form a stair or a peak.
- The conditions for printing "STAIRS" and "PEAK" are correctly implemented using the comparison operators.
- The program handles all possible outputs ("STAIRS", "PEAK", or "NONE") based on the given conditions.
- There are no logical errors or missing parts in the code that would cause incorrect behavior based on the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
