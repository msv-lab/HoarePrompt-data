Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, and k. For each test case, t is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^4, n and k are integers with 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k being even, and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. The function returns different outputs based on the given conditions for each test case.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing values for t, n, and k, and returns specific outputs based on the constraints provided for these parameters.
