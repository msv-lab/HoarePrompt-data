Output State: **`i` is assigned to `ans`, `left` is `S[0][0]`, `lsum` is `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`, the left value times 2 is greater than or equal to the left sum, and the right value times 2 is greater than or equal to the right sum, and the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`.**

Explanation: The code `ans = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `ans`. All other variables (`left`, `lsum`, `rsum`) remain unchanged. The conditions involving these variables are still valid as they were before the assignment.
