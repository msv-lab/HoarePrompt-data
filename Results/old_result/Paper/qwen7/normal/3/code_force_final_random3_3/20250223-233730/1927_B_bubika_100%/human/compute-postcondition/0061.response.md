Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers `s`. It then maps each integer in `s` to a corresponding character from a predefined string `a` based on the index of the integer in a count list `b`. The function increments the count of each integer in `b` for each occurrence in `s`. Finally, it prints a string composed of these characters. The function does not return any value but modifies and processes the input lists and strings as described.**
