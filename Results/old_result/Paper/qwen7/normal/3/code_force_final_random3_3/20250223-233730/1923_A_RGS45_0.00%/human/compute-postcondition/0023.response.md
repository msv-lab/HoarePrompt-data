Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1. The function returns a result for each test case based on the conditions specified, which include checking if any cell contains a chip.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and a list of binary values. It processes these inputs to determine if any cell contains a chip and returns a result accordingly.
