Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(2)`. The variables involved here are `j`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: The loop will start with `j` being set to the first value in the range, which is `0`.

3. **Check the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `2`. After `j` reaches `2`, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the states**: We need to ensure that the loop can start and execute at least once. This means `j` should be `0` at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `k` is 3
- `arr` is an empty list
- `lex` is an input integer
- `i` is 3
- `cases` is 3

The only variable that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is `j`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `j` being `0`.

**State: **`j` is 0**
