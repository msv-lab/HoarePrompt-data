Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it calculates a power value based on `n` and prints the result. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it finds the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n` and prints the value of that power.**
