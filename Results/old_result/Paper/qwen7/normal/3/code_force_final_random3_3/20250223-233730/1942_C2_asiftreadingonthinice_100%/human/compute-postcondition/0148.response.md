Output State: **`i` is 1, `len(a)` must be at least 1, and `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2; `tmp` contains an element which is `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, and the current value of `a[1] - a[0]` is even.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given that `i` is 1, the expression becomes `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`. Since `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even, dividing it by 2 results in an integer. This value is appended to `tmp`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
