Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `v1` and `v2` from the tuple `(v1, v2)` in the reversed `ops` list.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ops` is unchanged except for the last tuple, which now has its first element (`v1`) appended with `v1`.
   - `v1` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops` before the operation.
   - `v2` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops` before the operation.

3. **Determine the new values for `v1` and `v2`**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `ops[::-1]`, the last tuple in `ops` before the operation is being processed.
   - After the operation, the last tuple in `ops` is modified such that its first element (`v1`) is appended with `v1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the next iteration, the loop will process the second-to-last tuple in `ops` (before the modification).
   - Therefore, `v1` will be the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `ops` before the operation.
   - `v2` will be the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `ops` before the operation.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The `ops` list remains unchanged except for the last tuple, which is modified as described.
   - `v1` and `v2` are updated to reflect the second-to-last tuple in `ops` before the operation.

Given this reasoning, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `ops` is unchanged except for the last tuple which now has its first element appended with `v1`; `v1` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `ops` before the operation; `v2` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `ops` before the operation.**
