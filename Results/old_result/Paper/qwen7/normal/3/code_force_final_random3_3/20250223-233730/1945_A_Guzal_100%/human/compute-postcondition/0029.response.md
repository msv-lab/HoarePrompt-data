Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers inputted from the user, `k` is either 0 or `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`, `b` is either not divisible by 3 with `b % 3 + c` less than 3 or divisible by 3, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of the integers inputted from the user.**

The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. The condition for `k` remains the same, and the condition for `b` also remains the same.
