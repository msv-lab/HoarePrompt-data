Output State: **`c` is increased by 1, `ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is `k + 1`, `l` is increased by 1 if `s[k] == 'L'`, otherwise `r` is decreased by 1, and `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`**.

Explanation: The line `res[c] = ans % m % MOD` updates the value of `res[c]` to be the result of `ans % m % MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
