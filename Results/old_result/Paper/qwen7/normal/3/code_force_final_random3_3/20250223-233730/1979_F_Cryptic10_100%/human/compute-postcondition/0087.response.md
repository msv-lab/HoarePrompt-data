Output State: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive), `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is an empty set, `p2` is an empty set.**

Explanation:
- The line `vx, ops = set(i for i in range(1, int(input()) + 1)), []` creates a new set `vx` containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) and assigns an empty list to `ops`.
- The initial state of `ops` is a list with one less element than before, but since `ops` is now an empty list, this condition is no longer valid.
- The initial state of `p1` is an empty set or contains the `v1` value from the first tuple in `ops`, but since `ops` is now empty, `p1` remains an empty set.
- The initial state of `p2` is the last tuple in `ops` if the last element of the last tuple in `ops` equals the second last element of `ops`, otherwise `p1` contains the `v1` value from the first tuple in `ops`. Since `ops` is now empty, `p2` also remains an empty set.
