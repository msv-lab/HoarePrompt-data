Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `possible` remains `False`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer. However, the initial values of `i` and `possible` remain unchanged. `i` is still `n + 1`, and `possible` remains `False` unless there was a condition inside a loop that made it turn `True` for any index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, which is not applicable here since no such loop exists in the given code snippet.
