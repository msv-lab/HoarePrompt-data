Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately surrounding the `break` statement in the given code snippet, the `break` statement indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or conditional block that was active before this line of code. The values of `i`, `n`, and `possible` remain unchanged from their initial states.
