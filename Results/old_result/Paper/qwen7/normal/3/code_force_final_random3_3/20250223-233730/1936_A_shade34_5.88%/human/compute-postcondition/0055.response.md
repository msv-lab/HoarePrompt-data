Output State: **`i` is 2, 3, or 4; `n` must be greater than 3; `s` is a string input by the user; if `s` is '<', `pans` contains `[i-1, i-1]` and `mak` is equal to `i-1`; otherwise, `pans` contains `[i-1]` and `s` is the new input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Since `i` can be 2, 3, or 4, `pans` will contain `[i-1]` appended with `i-1`. If `s` was '<', then `pans` would already contain `[i-1]` and now it will contain `[i-1, i-1]`. If `s` was not '<', then `pans` will just contain `[i-1]` and `s` will be updated to the new input string.
