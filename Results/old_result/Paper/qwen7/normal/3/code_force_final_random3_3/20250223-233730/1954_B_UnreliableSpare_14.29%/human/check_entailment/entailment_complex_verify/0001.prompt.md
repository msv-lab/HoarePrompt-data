You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5; the array a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and the array a is beautiful; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.

            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: The loop has executed all iterations. The value of `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains as the original input integer, `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, and `flag` remains False since no break occurs in the if condition throughout all iterations.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `arr` is a list of integers, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` for each iteration, `cnt` is incremented by 1 for each element in `arr`, and `i` is equal to `n` (the length of `arr`).
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: Postcondition: `arr` is a list of integers, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` for each iteration, `cnt` is incremented by 1 for each element in `arr`, and `i` is equal to `n` (the length of `arr`). Whether `flag` is True or False, `ans` reflects the minimum value between its initial value and the count of elements processed in `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. It first checks if the array \( a \) is monotonous (i.e., all elements are the same). If the array is not monotonous, it calculates the minimum number of changes required to make the array monotonous. If the array is monotonous, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the calculated minimum number of changes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If so, it prints `-1` because no removals are needed to make it non-beautiful.
   - If the array is not uniform, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure the array cannot be made uniform again.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The program uses a flag to check if the array is uniform. This is done correctly.
   - If the array is uniform, the program correctly outputs `-1`.
   - If the array is not uniform, it counts the occurrences of the first element (`val`) and finds the minimum count of consecutive occurrences (`cnt`). This logic is flawed because it doesn't account for the condition required to make the array non-beautiful.
   - The program should identify the longest sequence of consecutive elements that can be removed to break the beauty condition. However, the current logic only considers the count of the first element.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Identify the longest sequence of consecutive elements that can be removed to break the beauty condition.
   - The correct approach involves identifying the longest sequence of identical elements and removing them to ensure the remaining array cannot be made uniform.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only considers the count of the first element, which is insufficient.
