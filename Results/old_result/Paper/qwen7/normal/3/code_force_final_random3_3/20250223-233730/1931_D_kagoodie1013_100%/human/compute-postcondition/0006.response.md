Output State: **`test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple, results is an empty list, count is 0, residue_map is an empty dictionary, `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x`, `arr` must have at least one element, `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`**.

The code snippet `r_y = num % y` assigns the remainder of `num` divided by `y` to the variable `r_y`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain as they were in the initial state.
