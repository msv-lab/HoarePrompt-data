Output State: `power` is 15, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 32768.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `power` until it is no longer less than the logarithm base 2 of `n`. Given that `power` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, we can determine the final value of `power` by finding the smallest integer \( k \) such that \( 2^{k-1} \geq n \). From the given outputs, we see that after 3 iterations, `power` is 4, meaning \( 2^{4-1} = 8 \) is the threshold for `n`. To find the number of iterations required for `power` to reach 15, we need \( 2^{15-1} = 32768 \). Therefore, the loop will execute until `power` reaches 15, at which point `2^{15-1} = 32768`, and `n` must be greater than 32768 for the loop to continue. However, since the condition `power < log2(n)` is no longer satisfied, the loop will terminate with `power` being 15.
