Output State: **`mid` is now equal to `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `right - f[0]` - 1 and `h` is not equal to `l`, `l` is less than `h`.**

Explanation: The code `h = mid` updates the variable `h` to be equal to the current value of `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
