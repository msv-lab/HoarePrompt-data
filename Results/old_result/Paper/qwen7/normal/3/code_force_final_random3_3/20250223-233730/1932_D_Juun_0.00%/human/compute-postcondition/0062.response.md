Postcondition: **`suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is a suit and the value is either `None` or a rank; `answers` is a list with one element which is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop(){trump}', `trumps` is a list with one element less than before, and we continue the loop if `rank` is `None`.**
