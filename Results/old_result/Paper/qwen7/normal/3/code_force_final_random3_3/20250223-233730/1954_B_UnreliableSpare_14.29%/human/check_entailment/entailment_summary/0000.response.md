Reasoning:
1. The program correctly identifies if the array is monotonous (all elements are the same).
2. For non-monotonous arrays, the program aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove to prevent the array from being beautiful.
3. The logic to calculate the minimum number of removals is flawed. Specifically, the program counts consecutive occurrences of the same element and uses this count to determine the minimum number of removals needed. However, this approach does not accurately reflect the requirement to remove elements to prevent the array from being beautiful.
4. The program should focus on identifying the longest sequence of elements that can be made identical through the allowed operations and removing the rest.
5. The current implementation does not handle the problem correctly because it only considers consecutive sequences without accounting for the specific operation rules.

Given these points, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
