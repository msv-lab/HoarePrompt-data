You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

Example

Input

    2
    
    6
    
    1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
    
    800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
    
    6
    
    4 5 6 7 8 9
    
    1 2 3 4 5 6

Output

    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

    #State: `i` is a value within the range [0, n], `j` is a value within the range [0, n - 1], `cnt` is equal to the total count of elements in the list `b` that are less than the current value of `a[i]` after all iterations, and `b` is a list of integers obtained from input.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of new problems needed.
   - It uses an index `i` to traverse the array `a`.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it iterates through the array `b` using index `j`.
   - If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, it increments the counter `cnt` because a new problem with difficulty `b[j]` needs to be added.
   - Otherwise, it increments the index `i` to move to the next element in `a`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements in `b`, it prints the value of `cnt`.

### Correctness Check

#### Example 1:
- **Input:**
  ```
  2
  6
  1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
  800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
  6
  4 5 6 7 8 9
  1 2 3 4 5 6
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  2
  3
  ```

- **Program Execution:**
  - For the first test case:
    - `a = [1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200, 2700]`
    - `b = [800, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2200, 3000]`
    - `cnt = 0`
    - When `j = 0`, `b[0] = 800 < a[0] = 1000`, so `cnt = 1`
    - When `j = 1`, `b[1] = 1200 >= a[0] = 1000`, so `i = 1`
    - When `j = 2`, `b[2] = 1500 >= a[1] = 1400`, so `i = 2`
    - When `j = 3`, `b[3] = 1800 >= a[2] = 2000`, so `i = 3`
    - When `j = 4`, `b[4] = 2200 >= a[3] = 2000`, so `i = 4`
    - When `j = 5`, `b[5] = 3000 > a[4] = 2200`, so `cnt = 2`
    - Final output: `2`
  - For the second test case:
    - `a = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
    - `b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
    - `cnt = 0`
    - When `j = 0`, `b[0] = 1 < a[0] = 4`, so `cnt = 1`
    - When `j = 1`, `b[1] = 2 < a[0] = 4`, so `cnt = 2`
    - When `j = 2`, `b[2] = 3 < a[0] = 4`, so `cnt = 3`
    - When `j = 3`, `b[3] = 4 >= a[0] = 4`, so `i = 1`
    - When `j = 4`, `b[4] = 5 >= a[1] = 5`, so `i = 2`
    - When `j = 5`, `b[5] = 6 >= a[2] = 6`, so `i = 3`
    - Final output: `3`

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of new problems needed to ensure that `a[i] <= b[i]` for all `i`. Therefore, the program is correct.
