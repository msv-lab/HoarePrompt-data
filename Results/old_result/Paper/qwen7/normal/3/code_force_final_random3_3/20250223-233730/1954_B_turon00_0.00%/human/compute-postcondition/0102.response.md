Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n`, `ans` will hold the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop execution, `tmp` will retain its initial value, `a` will remain as the list of integers provided initially, and `cnt` will be 0 since it is reset at the end of each iteration if `a[i]` does not equal `tmp`.**

This means that after the loop completes, `i` will have reached `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated through all elements in the list `a`. The variable `ans` will store the smallest count of consecutive occurrences of the initial value `tmp` found in the list `a`. The variable `tmp` retains its initial value, `a` remains unchanged, and `cnt` is reset to 0 because it is reset at the end of each iteration if the condition `a[i] != tmp` is met.
