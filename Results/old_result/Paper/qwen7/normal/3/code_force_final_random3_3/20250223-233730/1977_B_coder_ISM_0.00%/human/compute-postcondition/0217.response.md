Output State: **`i` is 0, `length` is 30, `s` is ['0'], `nalla` is 33, `(x & pow(2, i))` is False**

Explanation: The code `s.append('0')` appends the string '0' to the list `s`. Initially, `s` is an empty list, so after appending '0', `s` becomes `['0']`. The values of `i`, `length`, `nalla`, and the condition `(x & pow(2, i))` remain unchanged.
