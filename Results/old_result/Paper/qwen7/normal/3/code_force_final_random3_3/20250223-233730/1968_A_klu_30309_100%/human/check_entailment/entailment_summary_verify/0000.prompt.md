You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        results.append(best_y)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters: `t` (though `t` is not used in the function), a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of positive integers between 2 and 1000. It returns a list of `best_y` values, where each `best_y` is the largest integer less than the corresponding `x` in `test_cases` such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `best_y` plus `best_y` is maximized.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and the sum \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. Here's a breakdown of why the program works for all potential cases:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1. This ensures that the loop will start checking from the highest possible value of \( y \) (i.e., \( x-1 \)) and update `best_y` as soon as a higher sum is found.

2. **Loop through possible values of \( y \)**: The loop iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 1, calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \), and then adding \( y \) to get the current sum. If this sum is greater than the previously recorded `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to the current \( y \). The loop breaks early once a higher sum is found, ensuring efficiency.

3. **Appending results**: After processing all test cases, the program appends the best \( y \) found for each \( x \) to the results list and prints these results.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program handles all potential cases correctly. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail to meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
