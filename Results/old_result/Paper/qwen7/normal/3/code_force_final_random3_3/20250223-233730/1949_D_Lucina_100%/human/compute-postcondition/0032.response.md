Output State: **`j` is 4, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\), `b[i]` is incremented by 1**

The code snippet `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. However, the variable `b` and the index `i` are not defined in the initial state, so their values remain unknown. The only change is that `b[i]` is incremented by 1. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged.
