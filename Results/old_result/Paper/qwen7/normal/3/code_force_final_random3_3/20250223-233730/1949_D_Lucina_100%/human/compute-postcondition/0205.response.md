Postcondition: `nx` is either 'F' or 'S'. If `i` is between 1 and n//4 - 1 or `j` is between 1 and n//4 - 1, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is the string formed by concatenating the character at position `i` in `xx` with the character at position `j-1` in `xx`, and `i` is 1, `j` is between 1 and n inclusive.
