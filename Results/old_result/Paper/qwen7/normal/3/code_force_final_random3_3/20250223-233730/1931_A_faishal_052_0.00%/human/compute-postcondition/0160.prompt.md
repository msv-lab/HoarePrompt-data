Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an input integer, and `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cases):
    arr = []
    lex = int(input())
    for j in range(2):
        if lex <= 26:
            arr.append(1)
            lex = lex - 1
        elif lex < 52:
            arr.append(26)
            lex = lex - 26
        else:
            arr.append(26)
            lex = lex - 26
    arr.append(lex)
    arr.sort()
    for k in range(3):
        print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, printing 'a m z' and setting `k` to 2. The list `arr` remains unchanged as [1, 13, 26].

In more detail, after the loop completes all three iterations, the variable `k` will be set to 2 (since the loop runs from 0 to 2, inclusive). The list `arr` stays as [1, 13, 26] because the loop does not modify it. The loop prints the characters corresponding to the values in `arr` plus 96, which results in 'a', 'm', and 'z' being printed in sequence.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `k` is 3, `arr` is a sorted list with the last element being 0, `lex` is 0.

Explanation: The loop runs from `k=0` to `k=2`, which means it will iterate 3 times in total. After all iterations, the value of `k` will be 3. The list `arr` remains unchanged as the loop body does not modify it, and `lex` also remains 0 since the loop body does not affect it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, printing 'a' three times.

Explanation: Given the loop runs for 3 iterations as per the provided output states, the variable `k` will be set to 2 after the last iteration. Since the loop prints `chr(arr[k] + 96)` for each iteration with `k` ranging from 0 to 2, it will print the character corresponding to the value of `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[2]` plus 96, which corresponds to the characters 'a', 'a', and 'a' respectively (assuming `arr` is structured such that `arr[0]` to `arr[2]` are all 1, leading to 'a' being printed three times).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
