Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The variables involved here are `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: We know from the problem statement that `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

3. **Check the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is given as an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\), it is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t`, ensuring it is a positive integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\)**.
