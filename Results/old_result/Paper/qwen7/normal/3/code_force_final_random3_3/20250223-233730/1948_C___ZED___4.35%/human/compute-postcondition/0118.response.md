Output State: **`i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new string input by the user, `b` is the new input string, and `no_path` is `True`.**

Explanation: The line `no_path = True` sets the variable `no_path` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
