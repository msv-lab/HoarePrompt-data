Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`, `(b + c) % 3` is not 0.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is incremented by 1, so `k` is now `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. The conditions involving `b` and `c` remain unchanged, specifically, `(b + c) % 3` is not 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `c`) retain their original conditions and values from the initial state.
