Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `y - 1`, `results` list still contains 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y - 1`, `y` is `y - 2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y**.

Explanation: The code updates `current_sum` to `gcd_val + y`. Since `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y - 1`, and `y` is updated to `y - 2`, the new value of `current_sum` is calculated as `gcd_val + (y - 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
