Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the value of `a[0]` is equal to the value of `b[0]`, and the current value of `c[0]` is not equal to `a[0]`; `possible` is True.**

Explanation: The variable `possible` is assigned the value `True`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `a[0]`, `b[0]`, and `c[0]`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `possible` and retains the initial conditions of the other variables.
