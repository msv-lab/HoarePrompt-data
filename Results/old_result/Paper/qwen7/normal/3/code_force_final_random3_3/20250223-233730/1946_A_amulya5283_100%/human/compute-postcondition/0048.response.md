Output State: **`i` is `mdx + 2`, `n` must be greater than `mdx`, and `res` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition for increasing `res` by 1 (i.e., `a[mdx] == a[i]`) is not checked within this snippet, so the only change is the increment of `res`.
