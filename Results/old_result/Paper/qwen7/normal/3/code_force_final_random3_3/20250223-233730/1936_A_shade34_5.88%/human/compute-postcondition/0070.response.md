Output State: **`i` is 2, `mak` is 1**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `i` and `mak`. It is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console immediately. Since no variables are modified by this command, their values remain unchanged.
