Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30.
- `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < k - 1.
- `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `k` is updated to the first integer from input.
- `x` is updated to the second integer from input.
- `a` is updated to the third integer from input.
- `a` is less than `x + 1`.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string 'NO'. Since no other variables or objects are involved in this print statement, the output is straightforward.

Output: **NO**
