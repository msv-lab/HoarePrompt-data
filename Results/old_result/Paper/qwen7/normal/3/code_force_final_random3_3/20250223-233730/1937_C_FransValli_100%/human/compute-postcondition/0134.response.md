Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `res` is an input string, `arr` is a list containing the elements from 1 to `n-1`, `mini` is the first element of `arr` which is 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes `mini` with the first element of the list `arr`, which is 1 (since `arr` contains elements from 1 to `n-1`). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
