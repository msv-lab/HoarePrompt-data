### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
- A friend comes to the party if both the friend and their best friend receive an invitation.
- The program should correctly identify cycles and ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - Reads `n` (number of friends).
   - Initializes a list `v` of length `n+1` with the first element as 0 and the rest as integers from the input.
   - Checks if `n` is 2. If true, it prints 2.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through the list and checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i` for any `i`. If this condition is false, it prints 3.

2. **Annotated Code**:
   - The function correctly initializes `v` and reads the input.
   - For `n = 2`, it prints 2, which is correct.
   - For `n > 2`, it checks if there exists a pair `(i, v[v[v[i]]])` such that `i` and `v[v[v[i]]]` are best friends of each other. If such a pair exists, it prints 2, which is correct.
   - If no such pair exists, it prints 3, which is also correct because in this case, the only way to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is to invite all friends whose best friends are not part of a valid pair.

#### Example Analysis:
1. **Test Case 1**:
   ```
   5
   3 1 2 5 4
   ```
   - Here, the best friends form pairs: (3, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (5, 4), (4, 5).
   - The function correctly identifies that inviting friends 4 and 5 ensures both come to the party, so it prints 2.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   ```
   4
   2 3 4 1
   ```
   - Here, the best friends form a cycle: (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (1, 2).
   - The function correctly identifies that inviting friends 2 and 4 ensures both come to the party, so it prints 2.

3. **Test Case 3**:
   ```
   2
   2 1
   ```
   - Here, the best friends form a direct pair: (1, 2), (2, 1).
   - The function correctly prints 2 because inviting either friend ensures the other comes.

#### Correctness Verification:
- The program correctly handles all cases where there are cycles and pairs.
- It correctly prints 2 when a valid pair exists and 3 otherwise.
- The logic in the function is sound and covers all possible scenarios.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and handles all potential cases correctly.
