Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l` + (`h` - `l`) // 2, `h` is `mid`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`, and `l` must be less than `h`.**

Explanation: The code `h = mid` simply assigns the current value of `mid` to `h`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `h` being set to the current value of `mid`.
