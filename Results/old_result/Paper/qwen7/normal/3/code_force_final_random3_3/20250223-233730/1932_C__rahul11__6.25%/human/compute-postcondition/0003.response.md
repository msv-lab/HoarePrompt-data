Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer input within this range, `m` is the second integer input within this range, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list called `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. `m` also remains unchanged as only two integers were specified in the initial state and no new input was provided for `m`.
