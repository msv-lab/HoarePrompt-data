Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The function `func_2` seems to be attempting to solve a different problem, likely related to counting certain types of pairs based on quadratic expressions, which is not aligned with the given problem description. For instance, the calculation involving `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not seem to be relevant to the problem at hand.

To verify this, consider the following test case:
- Input: \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)

Expected output based on the problem description:
- Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 1)\)
- Output should be 3.

However, running the provided code with this input will not produce the correct result, indicating that the logic in `func_2` is incorrect. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
