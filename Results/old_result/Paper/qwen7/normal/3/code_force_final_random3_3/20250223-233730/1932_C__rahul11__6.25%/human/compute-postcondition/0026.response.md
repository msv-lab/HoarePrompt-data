Output State: **`ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `k` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, the character at index `k` in `s` is not 'L', `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes `r` being decreased by 1 while keeping all other conditions and values intact.
