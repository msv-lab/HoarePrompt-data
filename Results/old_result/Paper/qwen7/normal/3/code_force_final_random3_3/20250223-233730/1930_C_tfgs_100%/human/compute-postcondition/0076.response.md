Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers `a` received as input, modifies it by incrementing each element by its index plus one, and then generates a new list `ans` based on certain conditions. Finally, it prints the elements of `ans`. The function does not accept any direct parameters but operates on data derived from standard input.**
