Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is a positive integer such that 1 <= cases <= 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` contains the value 1. If `lex` is between 26 and 51, `arr` remains unchanged and still contains the element 26. If `lex` is less than 26, this case does not apply as per the given precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `lex` is an integer and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains the value 1. If `lex` is between 26 and 52, `arr` contains the elements [1, 26]. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` remains unchanged and still contains the elements [1, 26].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `lex` is an integer and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains the elements [1, 1]. If `lex` is between 27 and 51, `arr` contains the elements [1, 26, 26]. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` remains unchanged and still contains the elements [1, 26].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
