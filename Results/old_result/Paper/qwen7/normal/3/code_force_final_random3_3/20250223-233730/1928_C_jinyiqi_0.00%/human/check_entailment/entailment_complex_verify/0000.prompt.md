You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:

    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):

            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and n are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9.
def func_1(x):

        if x % i == 0:

            output2.append(int(x / i))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `output1` contains all divisors of `x` in ascending order, and `output2` contains the corresponding quotients in descending order.
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns a list that combines the divisors of x in descending order (from `output1`) with the corresponding quotients in descending order (from `output2`).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer \( x \) and returns a list containing the divisors of \( x \) in descending order, followed by the corresponding quotients in descending order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `x` is greater than `n/2`. Specifically, the logic in the program assumes that the number of possible `k` values can be derived from the divisors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)`, but it does not correctly account for the constraints of the problem.

For example, consider the test case `(n, x) = (100, 99)`. According to the problem description, the settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and the value of `k` must be such that the settling fits within the range of positions. However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of valid `k` values without properly considering the constraints.

In this specific case, the program will not correctly identify that there are no valid `k` values, leading to an incorrect output of `0` instead of the expected `0`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the calculated `k` values are within the valid range and correctly account for the repeating pattern of settling.
