Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is between 2 and 200000 inclusive, `s` is 2, `arr` contains two elements [(1, 1, 0), (2, 2, num)], `num` is assigned the value `nums[2]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `nums[2]` to the variable `num`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `i` is 2, `nums[2]` refers to the third element in the list `arr`, which means `num` is set to the third element's third value, i.e., `num`. The states of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `s`, and `arr`) are not affected.
