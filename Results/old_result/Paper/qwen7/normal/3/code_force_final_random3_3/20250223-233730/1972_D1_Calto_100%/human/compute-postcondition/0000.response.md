Output State: **`cnt` is -1**

The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. The code simply assigns `-1` to the variable `cnt`. No changes are made to `n` or `m`, and their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the only updated variable is `cnt`, which is now `-1`.
