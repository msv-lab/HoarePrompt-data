Output State: **`nx` is a string ending with 'S', `j` is incremented by 1, `n` must be between 2 and 24, `xx[i][j]` is either not '?' or equals '?'. If `xx[i][j]` is not '?', `nx` is equal to the previous value of `nx` plus the value of `xx[i][j]`. If `xx[i][j]` is '?', then `nx` remains a string. If i is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` ends with 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` ends with 'S'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends 'S' to the end of the string `nx`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and the conditions regarding `n`, `xx[i][j]`, and the ranges for `i` and `j` remain the same as the initial state.
