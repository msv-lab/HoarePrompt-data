Output State: **`vis` is now `[1, 1] + [0] * (n - 2)`, `pathb` is unchanged, `paths` is now `[p[ps - 1], a[ps - 1], a[ps - 1]]`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain as integers converted from their respective input values, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `i`, `resb`, and `p` remain in their previous states, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
