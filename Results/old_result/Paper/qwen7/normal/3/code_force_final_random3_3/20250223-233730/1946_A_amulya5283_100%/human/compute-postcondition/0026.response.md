Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **`total`**: It is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`.
2. **`n`**: It is an integer greater than `mdx` and not equal to 1.
3. **`a`**: It is a sorted list of integers.
4. **`res`**: It is explicitly given as 3.
5. **`mdx`**: It is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
6. **Middle index `mdx` of the list `a`**: It has the same value as the last index `i` that was checked during the loop, with `res` incremented each time `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]`.

Given this information, the print statement `print(res)` will simply print the value of the variable `res`, which is explicitly stated to be 3.

Output: **3**
