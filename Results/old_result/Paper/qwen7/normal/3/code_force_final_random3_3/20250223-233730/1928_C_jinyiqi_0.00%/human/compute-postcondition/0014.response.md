Output State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is `k + 1`, `output1` is a list containing the element `k + 1`, `output2` is a list containing the element `int(x / (k + 1))`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `int(x / i)` to `output2`. Given that `i` is `k + 1`, the expression `int(x / i)` becomes `int(x / (k + 1))`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
