Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `j` and the expression `n + r + 1`.
   - The variable `i` is mentioned in the context of updating `sum`, but it is not directly part of the loop head.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute:**
   - `j` should start from 1 and go up to `n + r + 1`.
   - For the loop to start, `j` must be less than or equal to `n + r + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is `2 * n + 2`
- `n` must be at least 1
- `r` could be `i` or 3
- `t` is reduced by `n * n` for each iteration
- `sum` is updated based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`

For the loop to execute, `j` must start from 1 and increment until it reaches `n + r + 1`. Given that `j` starts at `2 * n + 2`, we need to ensure that `2 * n + 2` is less than or equal to `n + r + 1`.

Since `r` can be either `i` or 3, and considering the initial conditions, let's assume the simplest case where `r = 3` (since `i` is not directly involved in the loop head):

- If `r = 3`, then `n + r + 1` becomes `n + 4`.
- We need `2 * n + 2 <= n + 4`.

This simplifies to:
\[ 2 * n + 2 \leq n + 4 \]
\[ n \leq 2 \]

Since `n` must be at least 1, the smallest valid value for `n` is 1. Let's verify this:
- If `n = 1`, then `2 * n + 2 = 4` and `n + r + 1 = 5`.
- This satisfies `4 <= 5`.

Therefore, the initial state for the loop to execute correctly should be:
- `j` starts at `2 * n + 2`
- `n` must be at least 1
- `r` must be such that `n + r + 1 >= 2 * n + 2`

Given these conditions, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.

**State:**
- `j` is `2 * n + 2`
- `n` must be at least 1
- `r` must be such that `n + r + 1 >= 2 * n + 2`

To simplify, we can say:
- `j` is `2 * n + 2`
- `n` must be at least 1
- `r` must be at least `n + 1`

So, the final state is:
**State: **`j` is `2 * n + 2`, `n` must be at least 1, `r` must be at least `n + 1`**.
