Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `j` is 0.
   - `n` is 1.
   - `done` is set to `True`.
   - `count` is greater than 1.
   - `count2` equals `count`.
   - The character at index `j` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` of `s`.
   - The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.

2. **String Slicing:**
   - The print statement is `print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])`.
   - Given `j` is 0, `string[:j - 1]` translates to `string[:0 - 1]` which is `string[:-1]`. Since slicing with a negative index from the start of the string returns an empty string, this part will be an empty string `""`.
   - `string[j - 1:]` translates to `string[0 - 1:]` which is `string[-1:]`. This will return the last character of the string `s`.

3. **Combining the Results:**
   - The first part of the print statement `string[:j - 1]` is an empty string `""`.
   - The second part of the print statement `string[j - 1:]` is the last character of the string `s`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **'', s[-1]**
