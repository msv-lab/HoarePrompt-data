Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer.
   - Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Adjust the state**:
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a value within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Given these points, we need to ensure that the input to `int(input())` is within the specified range.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `i` will start from 0.
- `t` (which is the input to `int(input())`) must be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

**State:**
**`i` is 0, `t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
