Output: **n // 2 * b (where n is an integer from the input, and b is an integer from the input)**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\). However, this value is not used in the print statement.
- The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers from the input. The print statement calculates `n // 2 * b`, which is the integer division of `n` by 2, multiplied by `b`.
- Since the exact values of `n` and `b` are not specified, the output is described in terms of these variables.
