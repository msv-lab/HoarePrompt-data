Output State: **`ans` is 0 + x // 4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` must have at least one value.**

Explanation: The line `ans += x // 4` updates the value of `ans` by adding the integer division of `x` by 4 to its current value. Since the initial value of `ans` is 0, the new value of `ans` becomes `0 + x // 4`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
