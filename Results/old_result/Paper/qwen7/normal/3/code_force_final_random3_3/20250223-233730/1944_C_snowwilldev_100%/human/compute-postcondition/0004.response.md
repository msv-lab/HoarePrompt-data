Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `N` must be a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the value of `cnt[a[i]]` has been incremented by 1 for the current index `i` in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
