Output State: `count` is the total sum of occurrences of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` across all elements in `arr`, `results` is a list starting with 0 and then appending `count` at the end, `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` and its value is the count of how many times this pair has been encountered, `n` is the number of elements in the original `arr`, `x` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `y` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `arr` is an empty list since all elements have been processed, `num` is not applicable as the loop has finished, `r_y` is not applicable as the loop has finished, `current_key` is not applicable as the loop has finished.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `count` will hold the cumulative sum of occurrences of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` found in the array `arr`. The `results` list will start with 0 and end with the final value of `count`. The `residue_map` dictionary will contain every unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair that appeared in `arr` along with their counts. The `arr` list will be empty because all elements have been processed. Variables `num`, `r_y`, and `current_key` will no longer be relevant as the loop has ended.
