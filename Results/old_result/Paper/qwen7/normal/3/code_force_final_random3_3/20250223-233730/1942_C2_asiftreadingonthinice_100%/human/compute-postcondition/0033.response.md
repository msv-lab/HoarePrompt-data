Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 1`, `ans` will be the sum of all increments made to it during the loop, and `tmp` will contain all the values added to it whenever `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and equals to 2 modulo 2.**

To break this down further:
- The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration of the loop. Since the loop runs from `1` to `len(a) - 1`, when the loop finishes, `i` will be `len(a) - 1`.
- The variable `ans` is incremented by 1 each time `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2. Therefore, `ans` will be the count of such occurrences.
- The variable `tmp` collects the values of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` whenever `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even. This means `tmp` will contain all such values collected throughout the loop's iterations.
