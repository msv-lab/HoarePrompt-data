Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`**.

Explanation: The value of `k` was initially calculated as `a + (b + c) // 3`. After executing `k += 1`, the value of `k` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` now becomes `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
