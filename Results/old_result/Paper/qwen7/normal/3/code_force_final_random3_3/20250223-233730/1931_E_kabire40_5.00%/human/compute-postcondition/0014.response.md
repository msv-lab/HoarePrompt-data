Output State: **`rev_val` is either an empty list or a list containing the reversed string of `x` (`'x_reversed'`), `rev_res` is either the original string `x` or an empty string, `list_len` is the length of the input string, `max_power` is the maximum power of the input string, `operational_list` is a list created from the split input and now has one less element, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`, `x_rev` is calculated as `int(x[::-1])`**.

This means that the variable `x_rev` has been updated to the integer value of the reversed string of `x`. All other variables remain in their initial states.
