Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly find the value of \( y \) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. Instead, it simply sets \( y \) to \( x // 2 \), which does not necessarily maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

For example, consider the input \( x = 10 \). The program outputs \( y = 5 \), but \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10\). However, \( y = 9 \) also satisfies \( 1 \leq y < x \), and \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 18\), which is greater than 10. Therefore, the program does not always find the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
