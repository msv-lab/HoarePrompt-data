Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + n`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx-n-1:idx-1]` converted using `map(int, ...)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a)` for the current iteration.**

Explanation: The code appends the return value of `func_1(n, a)` to the `results` list. The `idx` is updated to `idx + n`. The list `a` remains unchanged in terms of its content but is now referenced in the context of the new `idx`. The `data` and the previous return values in `results` remain unchanged.
