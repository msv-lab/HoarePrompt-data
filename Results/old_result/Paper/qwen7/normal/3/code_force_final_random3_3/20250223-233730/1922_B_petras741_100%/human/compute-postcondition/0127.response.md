Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n + 1):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initially set to `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will run as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.

4. **Check if the initial state allows the loop to execute**:
   - Since `j` is initially set to `n`, and the loop runs while `j < n + 1`, the loop will execute at least once (when `j` is 0).

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - We need to ensure that `j` is initialized to `n` and `n` is greater than 0.

Given the information provided, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0**
