Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial state of `t` and `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be an integer between 1 and 10^4, and `i` is still 0. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are the integers entered by the user.
