Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an odd integer.
- `a` is the second integer input.
- `b` is the third integer input.
- The current value of `b` is greater than twice the value of `a`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a * n)`.

From the precondition, we know:
- `a` is the second integer input.
- `n` is an odd integer.

However, the specific value of `a` and `n` is not provided, so we cannot give a precise numerical answer. But we can describe the expression `a * n` based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **a * n (where a is the second integer input and n is an odd integer)**
