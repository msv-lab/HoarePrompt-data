Output State: **`i` is 1 (or any value in the range [1, n-1]), `n` must be at least 4, `res` is an input string, and the current value of `res` is equal to '<', `arr` is a list containing the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `arr` with the value of `i`. Since `i` is 1 (or any value in the range [1, n-1]) and `n` must be at least 4, the list `arr` contains the value of `i`. The values of `res` and `n` remain unchanged.
