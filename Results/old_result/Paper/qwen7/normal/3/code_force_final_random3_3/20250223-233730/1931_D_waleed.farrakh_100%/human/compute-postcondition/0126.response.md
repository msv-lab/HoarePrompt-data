Output State: **The program returns a list named 'results' which contains the cumulative sum of 'count' values computed over all iterations of the loop. Additionally, the list includes the final states of 'freq', 'rx', 'ry', and 'current_pair' from the last iteration.**

This means that the program returns a list where each element represents the cumulative sum of the `count` values up to that point in the loop, along with the final values of `freq`, `rx`, `ry`, and `current_pair` from the last iteration of the loop.
