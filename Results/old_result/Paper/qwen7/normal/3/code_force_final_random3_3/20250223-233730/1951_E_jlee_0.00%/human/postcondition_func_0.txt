The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, where each test case consists of a string `s` of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it checks if the string can be split into two parts such that the first part is the reverse of the second part, or if the string can be made into such a form by removing at most one character. If such a transformation is possible, it prints "YES" along with the number of operations (either 1 or 2) and the modified string; otherwise, it prints "NO". After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
