Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `res` is an input string, `maxi` is `n-1`, `arr` is `[0]`**.

Explanation: The code initializes a list `arr` with a single element `0`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `res`, or `maxi`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
