#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is one of "CDHS". The third line of each test case contains a list of 2n unique cards, where each card is represented by a two-character string with the first character being the rank ("23456789") and the second character being the suit ("CDHS").
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning all cards have been processed. Here's what the final state will look like:
    #
    #- `trumps`: This list contains all the ranks of cards that had the same suit as the trump suit.
    #- `suits`: This dictionary will have each suit ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S') mapped to either `None` (if no further cards of that suit were encountered) or the highest rank of the cards that had that suit but did not match the trump suit.
    #- `answers`: This list contains all the valid pairs of cards that were found to have the same suit, sorted and joined by a space. Each pair consists of the higher rank followed by the lower rank for each suit that was not the trump suit.
    #
    #In summary, `trumps` will hold all ranks of cards that matched the trump suit, `suits` will indicate the highest rank for each non-trump suit, and `answers` will contain all valid pairs of cards from the same non-trump suit.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: All ranks of cards that matched the trump suit are stored in the `trumps` list. The `suits` dictionary maps each suit ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S') to either `None` (if no further cards of that suit were encountered) or the highest rank of the cards that had that suit but did not match the trump suit. The `answers` list contains all valid pairs of cards that were found to have the same suit, sorted and joined by a space, with each pair consisting of the higher rank followed by the lower rank for each non-trump suit.
    trumps = sorted(trumps)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: Output State: `trumps` is an empty list.
    #
    #Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `trumps` will be an empty list because the loop continues to remove (pop) elements from `trumps` until it is empty. Given that the loop condition `trumps != []` ensures that the loop runs as long as `trumps` is not empty, once all elements are popped, the condition fails, and the loop terminates with `trumps` being empty.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: `trumps` is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each including an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), a trump suit ("CDHS"), and a list of 2n unique cards. It identifies cards that match the trump suit and forms valid pairs of cards from the same non-trump suit. The function then prints the results, which include the ranks of cards that matched the trump suit, valid pairs of cards from the same non-trump suit, and prints "IMPOSSIBLE" if no valid pairs can be formed. The function does not return any value.
