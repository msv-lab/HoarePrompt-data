Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` (if '1' is present) or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1` if both `x` and `n - y` are valid indices, otherwise `z` is an empty string.**

This output state describes the updated values of the variables after executing the given code snippet. The variable `z` is assigned a substring of `arr` based on the indices `x` and `n - y`. If `x` is -1 or `n - y` is less than 0, `z` will be an empty string.
