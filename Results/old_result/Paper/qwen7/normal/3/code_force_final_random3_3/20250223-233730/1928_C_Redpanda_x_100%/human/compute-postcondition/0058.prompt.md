You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than 1.
def func_1(n):
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 4; `nn` is 1; `factors` is a dictionary with key 2 and value 2, key 3 and value 3.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be incremented to 4 (since it starts from 2 and increments by 1 each iteration). The value of `nn` becomes 1 because it is continuously divided by its factors until it can no longer be divided (as seen in the output states after 2 and 3 iterations). The `factors` dictionary contains the prime factorization of the original number `n`, which in this case is 2^2 * 3^3 based on the given output states.
    if (nn > 1) :
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    #State: `i` is 4, `nn` is 1, `factors` is a dictionary with key 2 and value 2, key 3 and value 3, and if `nn` is greater than 1, `factors[nn]` is 1.
    primes = list(factors.keys())
    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute until `generate(0)` no longer produces any values. Since we do not have the definition of `generate(0)`, we can infer that the loop will keep yielding factors until there are no more factors left to yield. After executing all iterations, `factor` will be set to the last value generated by `generate(0)`. The variables `i`, `nn`, `factors`, and `primes` will retain their final states from the last iteration of the loop.
    #
    #In Natural Language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `factor` will hold the last value generated by the `generate(0)` function. The values of `i`, `nn`, `factors`, and `primes` will remain unchanged from their state after the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter n, which is a positive integer greater than 1, and returns "prime" if n is a prime number, otherwise it returns "not prime".

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
