Output State: `n` must be at least 9.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `j` from 4 up to `n`. After 3 iterations, `j` is `n + 1`, meaning `n` must be at least 5. Each additional iteration increases `j` by 1. Therefore, after all iterations, if the loop has completed its full course, `j` would be `n + 1`, implying that `n` must be at least 9 for the loop to complete all its iterations.
