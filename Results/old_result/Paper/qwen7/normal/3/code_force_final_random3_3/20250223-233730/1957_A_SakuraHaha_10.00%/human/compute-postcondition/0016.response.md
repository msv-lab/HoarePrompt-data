Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in cnt.values():`. The variables involved here are `x` and `cnt`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `cnt` has at least one value. At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` must have at least one less value.

3. **Determine the changes needed**: Since `x` is taken from `cnt.values()`, each iteration of the loop will remove one value from `cnt`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must have at least one more value than it had at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `ans`: This variable is not directly affected by the loop head, so its value remains the same.
   - `t`: This variable is not directly affected by the loop head, so its value remains the same.
   - `n`: This variable is not directly affected by the loop head, so its value remains the same.
   - `a`: This variable is not directly affected by the loop head, so its value remains the same.
   - `cnt`: For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must have at least one more value than it had at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `cnt` must have at least one less value at the end of the previous iteration, it means `cnt` had at least one value before the previous iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must now have at least two values.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` is 0 + x // 4 + x // 4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least two values**
