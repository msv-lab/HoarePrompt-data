Output State: **`possible` is `True`, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional statement that was checking the equality of characters in strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `possible`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, and the program exits the loop or conditional statement.
