Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is `True`, `count` is greater than 0, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is either equal to `count` or 0, depending on whether the condition `count > 1` is true or false. If `count > 1`, `count2` remains `count`; otherwise, `count2` becomes 0.
