Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx-n-1:idx-1]`, `results` is a list with two additional elements which are the return values of `func_1(n, a)` for the current and previous iterations.**

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `idx` is updated to `idx + 1`. The other variables (`data`, `a`, and `results`) retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
