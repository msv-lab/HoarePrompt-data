Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True`, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string, the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to the current value of `c[i]`**.

Explanation: The variable `possible` is set to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` remains `n + 1`, `n` must still be greater than 0, `possible` is now `True`, `b` and `c` are still the stripped input strings, and the condition that the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to the current value of `c[i]` still holds true.
