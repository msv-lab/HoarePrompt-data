Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[v]` now contains `u`.**

Explanation: The code appends `u` to the list `nodes[v]`. Initially, `nodes[u]` contained `v`. After executing the code, `nodes[v]` will now contain both `u` and `v`. The values of `i`, `n`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged.
