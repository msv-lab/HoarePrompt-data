Output State: **`a` is assigned to `x`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an updated input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `x` is now equal to `a`, and `y` is \(n + 1\).**

In this case, the code simply assigns the value of `a` to `x`. The values of `ans`, `t`, `n`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
