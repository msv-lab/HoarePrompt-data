Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is `True`, `count` is greater than 0, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where `j` is being incremented and checked against `n`. The values of `j`, `n`, `done`, `count`, and `count2` remain unchanged, and the condition that `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is greater than or equal to `count` also remains valid.
