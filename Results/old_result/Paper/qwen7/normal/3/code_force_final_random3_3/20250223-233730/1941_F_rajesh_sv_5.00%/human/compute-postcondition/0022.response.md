Output State: **`max_diff` is equal to `diff` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise `max_diff` remains `-inf`. `next_max_diff` is equal to `diff`. `index` is `i` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise it remains `None`. `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` retain their original values from `func_4()`**.

Explanation: The code sets `next_max_diff` to the current value of `diff`. This does not affect `max_diff`, `index`, `A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F`, nor does it change the relationship between `diff` and `max_diff` or `index`. Therefore, the output state reflects these changes while keeping the unchanged variables in their original states.
