Output State: **`data` is a list containing strings split from the input, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `idx` is 2, and the values of `n` and the list `a` will be determined later based on the input.**

Explanation: The variable `idx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables (`data`, `t`, and the future values of `n` and `a`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
