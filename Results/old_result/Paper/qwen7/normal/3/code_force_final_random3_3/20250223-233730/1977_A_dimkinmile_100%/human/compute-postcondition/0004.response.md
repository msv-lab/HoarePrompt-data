Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- The condition \((n - m) \% 2 \neq 0\) or \(n - m < 0\) is true.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('No')
```

The print statement simply outputs the string `'No'`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` do not affect this output because the print statement does not reference any of these variables. It only prints the fixed string `'No'`.

Output: **'No'**
