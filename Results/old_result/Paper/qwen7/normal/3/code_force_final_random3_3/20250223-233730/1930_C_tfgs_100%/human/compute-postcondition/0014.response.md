Output State: **`cur` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order where each element `a[j]` (where \(0 \leq j < n\)) is equal to \(n - j\), `counter` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique element in the list `a`, `cnt` is \(n - len(a)\)**.

Explanation: The code `cnt = n - len(a)` calculates the difference between `n` and the length of the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order where each element `a[j]` is equal to \(n - j\), the length of `a` is `n`. Therefore, `cnt` is calculated as \(n - n = 0\). All other variables remain unchanged.
