Given the initial state:
- `j` is 0
- `n` is the length of the list `s`
- `done` is `True`
- `count` is 0

The code snippet is:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Since `j` is 0, `j - 1` evaluates to -1.
2. `string[:j - 1]` translates to `string[:-1]`, which means it will take all elements from the start of the string up to but not including the last element.
3. `string[j - 1:]` translates to `string[-1:]`, which means it will take only the last element of the string.

Given these evaluations, the print statement will output:
- The first part: `string[:-1]` (all elements except the last one)
- The second part: `string[-1:]` (the last element)

Therefore, the output will be the concatenation of the string without its last character followed by the last character itself.

Output: **string[:-1] string[-1:]**
