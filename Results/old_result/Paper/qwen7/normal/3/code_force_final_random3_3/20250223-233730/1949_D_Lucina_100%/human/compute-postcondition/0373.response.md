Output State: **`j` is 2 or 3, `n` must be at least 2, `nx` is a string containing 'F' appended to its end.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the end of the string stored in `nx`. Since `nx` was not previously defined, it is assumed to be an empty string before this operation. After the operation, `nx` will contain 'F'. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
