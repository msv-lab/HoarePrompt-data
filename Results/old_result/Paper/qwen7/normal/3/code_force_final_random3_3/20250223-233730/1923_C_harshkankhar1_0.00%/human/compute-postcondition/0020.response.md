Output State: **`q` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `q` - 1, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, the values of `x` and `y` are updated to integers based on user input.**

This means that `q` retains its previous state (greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `q` - 1), while `x` and `y` are updated to the integers provided by the user input.
