Output State: `k` is 3, `arr` is a sorted list with the last element being 0, `lex` is 0.

Explanation: The loop runs from `k=0` to `k=2`, which means it will iterate 3 times in total. After all iterations, the value of `k` will be 3. The list `arr` remains unchanged as the loop body does not modify it, and `lex` also remains 0 since the loop body does not affect it.
