Postcondition: `j` is assigned the value of `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is a character, and `count` is greater than 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then `done` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, and `count2` is less than `count`, then `done` becomes True. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.
