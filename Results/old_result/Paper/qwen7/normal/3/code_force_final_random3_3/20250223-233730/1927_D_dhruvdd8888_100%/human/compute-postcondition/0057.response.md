Postcondition: `s` is assigned the value of the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is assigned the value of the third element of the same tuple, `n` remains a positive integer inputted initially, `s` is less than or equal to `l`, and if `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, then `e` is set according to the if condition; otherwise, `e` is set according to the else condition, ensuring `e` is less than `N` or greater than or equal to `r`.
