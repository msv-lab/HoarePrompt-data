Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `output1` contains all divisors of `x` in ascending order, and `output2` contains the corresponding quotients in descending order.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over all integers from 1 to the square root of `x`. For each integer `i` where `x` is divisible by `i`, it appends `i` to `output1` and `x // i` to `output2`. Since the loop runs until `i` reaches the square root of `x`, it ensures that both `i` and `x // i` are included as divisors. When `i` exceeds the square root of `x`, the corresponding `x // i` will be less than or equal to `i`, ensuring all divisors are captured without repetition. Thus, `output1` will contain all divisors of `x` in ascending order, and `output2` will contain the corresponding quotients in descending order.
