Output State: **`cur` is `cur + counter[a[i]] - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, `ans` now contains `n` elements, and each element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1 - j) - 1` for `j` in the range of `adv`. If `i > 0`, then `adv` is 0.**

Explanation: The code decrements the value of `counter[a[i]]` by 1. This affects the value of `cur` since it was previously defined as `cur + counter[a[i]]`. Therefore, the new value of `cur` is `cur + counter[a[i]] - 1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
