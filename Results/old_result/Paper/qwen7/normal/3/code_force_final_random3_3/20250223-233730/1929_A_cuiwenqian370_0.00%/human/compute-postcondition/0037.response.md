Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(1, n):` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `max_beauty` is increased by the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is `left + 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 and checked against `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, after the next iteration, `i` will become `2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain `left + 1`.

5. **Consider the effect on `max_beauty`**: The value of `max_beauty` is updated based on the values of `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]` during each iteration. However, since we are only asked to adjust the states at the start of the next iteration, we do not need to change `max_beauty` explicitly.

6. **Formulate the new state**: Based on the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
   - `max_beauty` remains unchanged (we do not know its exact value but it is not being modified).
   - `i` becomes `2`.
   - `n` remains `left + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`max_beauty` is increased by the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]`, `i` is 2, `n` is `left + 1`**.
