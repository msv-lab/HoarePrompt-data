Postcondition: `decoded` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' and an additional 'z'. If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` has an additional element which is the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`. Otherwise, `decoded` remains unchanged with each character having its corresponding decoded value in `mapping`, and `c` is 122, which is the ASCII value for 'z'.
