Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `A` is `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`, `A` is recalculated as `int(m / a) + 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `B` to `int(m / b) + 1`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `m`, `A`, and the original calculation of `B` remain unchanged. The variable `A` is recalculated again, but since the code does not assign this new value to `A`, the value of `A` remains the same as before. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions and the updated value of `B`.
