Postcondition: `pathb` contains the last element of `a` at index `p[pb - 1] - 1`, `a` retains its original values. If `vis[pb - 1]` is equal to 1, then `pathb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1] - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `vis[pb - 1]` is not equal to 1, then `pathb` remains unchanged.
