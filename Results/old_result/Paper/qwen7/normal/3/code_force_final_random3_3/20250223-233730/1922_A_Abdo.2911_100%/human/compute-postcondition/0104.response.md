Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block that `break` is directly associated with, the only effect is that the program exits the current loop or conditional context. The values of `i`, `n`, and `possible` remain unchanged from their initial states.
