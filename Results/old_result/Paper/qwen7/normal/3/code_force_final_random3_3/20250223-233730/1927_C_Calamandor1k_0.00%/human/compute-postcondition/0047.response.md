Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable here is `t`, which is used to control the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, all iterations of the loop have been executed, meaning `i` has reached the value of `max(len_a, len_b)`. This implies that the loop has completed its execution based on the value of `t`.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `0` to `t-1`. If `t` iterations have been completed, then `t` is now equal to the number of iterations that have already occurred.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be set to `t + 1`.

5. **Maintain Other States**: Since no other variables are mentioned in the loop head, we don't need to adjust any other states.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is t + 1**
