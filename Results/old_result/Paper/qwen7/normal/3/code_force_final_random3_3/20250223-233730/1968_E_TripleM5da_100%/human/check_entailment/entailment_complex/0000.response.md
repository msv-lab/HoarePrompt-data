Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The provided program attempts to generate a set of points that might maximize \(\mathcal{H}\).
3. However, the program only prints a fixed pattern of points for each \(n\):
   - It always prints the point \((1, 1)\).
   - It always prints the point \((1, 2)\).
   - It then prints points \((i, i)\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\).

4. Let's analyze the generated points for different values of \(n\):
   - For \(n = 2\): Points are \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\). Distances: \(\{0, 1\}\). This is correct.
   - For \(n = 3\): Points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\). Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2\}\). This is correct.
   - For \(n = 4\): Points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\). Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\). This is correct.
   - For \(n = 5\): Points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\). Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\). This is correct.
   - For \(n = 6\): Points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), \((6, 6)\). Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\). This is correct.

5. The pattern works for small values of \(n\), but it does not necessarily maximize \(\mathcal{H}\) for larger \(n\). For example, for \(n = 10\), the program would generate points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), \((6, 6)\), \((7, 7)\), \((8, 8)\), \((9, 9)\), \((10, 10)\). The maximum distance here is 9, but it could be larger with a different arrangement.

6. The program does not explore other possible configurations that might yield a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Therefore, the program does not guarantee the maximization of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\).

Correctness: **False**
