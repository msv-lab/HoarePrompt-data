Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Other variables remain unchanged.**

This means that the variable `t` has been updated to hold the integer value entered by the user, ensuring it is within the specified range. The other variables (`x` and any others not mentioned) remain in their initial state.
