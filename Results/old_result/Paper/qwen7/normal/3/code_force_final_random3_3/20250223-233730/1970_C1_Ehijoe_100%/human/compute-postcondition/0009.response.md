Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory list, `i` is 1, `nodes[v]` includes `u`**.

Explanation: The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `u` and `v`. The values of `t`, `n`, `empty`, `nodes`, and `i` remain unchanged. `nodes[v]` now includes `u` after the assignment.
