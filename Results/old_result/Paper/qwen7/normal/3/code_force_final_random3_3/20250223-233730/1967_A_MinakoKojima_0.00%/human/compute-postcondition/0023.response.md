Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), meaning `i` starts at `1` and increments until it reaches `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is multiplied by `a[1] - a[0]`.
   - `i` is `2`.
   - `n` must be greater than `0`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently `2`, the loop will continue if `i < n`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented to `3` in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than `3` because `i` needs to be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `3` in the next iteration.
   - `n` must be greater than `3` for the loop to continue.

6. **Final state**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged as it was not specified to be modified in the loop head.
   - `i` is now `3`.
   - `n` must be greater than `3`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`ans` is multiplied by `a[1] - a[0]`, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
