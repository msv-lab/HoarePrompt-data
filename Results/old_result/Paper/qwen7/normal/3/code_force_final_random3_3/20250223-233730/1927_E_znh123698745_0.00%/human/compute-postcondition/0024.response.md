Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `array` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `a[-1]` is decreased by 1, `answer` has a new element which is `array[a[-1]]`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3. The `array` and `a` remain unchanged. The last element of `a` (denoted as `a[-1]`) is decremented by 1. Consequently, the new element in `answer` is now `array[a[-1]]`, reflecting the updated value of `a[-1]`.
