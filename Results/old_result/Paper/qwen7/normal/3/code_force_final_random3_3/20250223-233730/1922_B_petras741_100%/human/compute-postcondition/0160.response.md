Output State: **`j` is 5, `eta_ln` remains the same, `res` is increased by `q[eta[5]] * (q[eta[5]] - 1) * (q[eta[5]] - 2) // 6`**.

This means that the value of `j` remains 5 and `eta_ln` stays unchanged. The variable `res` is updated by adding the value of `q[eta[5]] * (q[eta[5]] - 1) * (q[eta[5]] - 2) // 6` to its current value.
