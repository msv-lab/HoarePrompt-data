Output State: **`q` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `t`, `buffer`, `i`, `w`, `eta`, `rho`, `j`, `eta_ln`, and `res` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `q` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This operation does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.
