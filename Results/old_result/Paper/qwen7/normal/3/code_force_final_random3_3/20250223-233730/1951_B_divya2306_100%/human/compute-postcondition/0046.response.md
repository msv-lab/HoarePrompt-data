Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `wins` is 5.
   - `win_with_swap` is 8.
   - `i` is 9.
   - `k` is an integer greater than 8.

2. **Expression Analysis**:
   The expression to be evaluated is:
   \[
   \text{max}(wins - 1, win\_with\_swap - wins - 1 + (wins \neq 0))
   \]

3. **Substitute Known Values**:
   - `wins = 5`
   - `win_with_swap = 8`

4. **Evaluate Each Part of the Expression**:
   - First part: `wins - 1`
     \[
     5 - 1 = 4
     \]
   - Second part: `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins \neq 0)`
     - `win_with_swap - wins - 1`:
       \[
       8 - 5 - 1 = 2
       \]
     - `(wins \neq 0)` is `True`, which evaluates to `1` in Python.
     - Therefore, `2 + 1 = 3`.

5. **Determine the Maximum Value**:
   - We have two values to compare: 4 and 3.
   - The maximum of these values is 4.

6. **Final Output**:
   The expression evaluates to 4, so the `print` statement will output this value.

Output: **4**
