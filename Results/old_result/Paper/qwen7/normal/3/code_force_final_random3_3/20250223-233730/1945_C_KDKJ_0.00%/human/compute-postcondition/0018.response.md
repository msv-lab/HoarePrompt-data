Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1', but one character shorter than before; `S` is a list containing two lists `[x+1, y+1]` and `[x, y]` where `x` is the last character of the new `a` plus 1 if the last character of the new `a` is '0', and `y` is the last character of the new `a` plus 1 if the first character of the new `a` is '1'.**

Explanation: The code appends a new list `[x, y]` to the existing list `S`. The values of `x` and `y` are determined based on the last and first characters of the string `a` respectively. The initial state of `S` contains a single list `[x+1, y+1]`. After executing the code, `S` now contains both `[x+1, y+1]` and `[x, y]`.
