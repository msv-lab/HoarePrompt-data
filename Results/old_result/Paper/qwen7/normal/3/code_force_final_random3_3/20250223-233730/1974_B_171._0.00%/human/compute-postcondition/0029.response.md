Output State: **`c` must be within the range 97 to 123 (inclusive), `char` is the next character in encoded, `decoded` either has one more element than before with the last element being the decoded value corresponding to `char` in mapping, or `decoded` remains unchanged; `mapping[chr(c)]` is now equal to `char`.**

This means that the dictionary `mapping` has been updated such that the key `chr(c)` is now mapped to the value `char`. All other conditions remain the same as the initial state.
