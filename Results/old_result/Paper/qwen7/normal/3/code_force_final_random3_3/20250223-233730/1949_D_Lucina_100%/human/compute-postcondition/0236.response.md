Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `nx` is 'S', `n` is a positive integer, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', `i` is not in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` and `j` is not in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]**.

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after executing this line, `nx` becomes 'S'. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
