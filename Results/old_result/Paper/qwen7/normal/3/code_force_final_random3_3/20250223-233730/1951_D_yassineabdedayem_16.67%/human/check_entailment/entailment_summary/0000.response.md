Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining if Bob can set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. The solution should output "YES" with the number of stalls and their respective prices if possible, or "NO" if it's not possible.

2. **Reviewing the Given Program**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, which are the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.
   - It then enters a loop where it tries to find a suitable price for each stall to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The logic inside the loop seems to be flawed because it attempts to minimize the number of coins spent without considering the exact count of jewels Alice needs to buy.

3. **Key Issues**:
   - The logic to calculate the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall is incorrect. It doesn't ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The loop condition and logic to adjust `n` and `k` are not correctly implemented to achieve the goal of buying exactly `k` jewels.
   - The program does not handle the case where it is impossible to buy exactly `k` jewels, even though it should print "NO" in such cases.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - Based on the provided execution summary, the program does not correctly implement the logic to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The program may produce incorrect results or fail to handle some edge cases properly.

Correctness: **False**
