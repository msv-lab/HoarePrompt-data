Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the game logic for determining the winner. Specifically, the `func_1` function calculates the distance from the starting node to all other nodes but does not consider the optimal strategy for the game. The game requires alternating moves between Ron and Hermione, and the winner is determined based on whether the number of possible moves is odd or even, not just the distance from the starting node.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the game rounds and determine the winner based on the parity of the number of possible moves for each player. The current implementation does not account for the alternating moves and the optimal strategy for each player.
