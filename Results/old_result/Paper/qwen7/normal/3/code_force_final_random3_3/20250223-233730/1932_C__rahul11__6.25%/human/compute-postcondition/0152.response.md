Postcondition: `c` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD` if `s[k] == 'L'`, otherwise `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is incremented by 1, `l` is incremented by 1 if `s[k] == 'L'`, otherwise `r` is decremented by 1, and these operations are performed for the next iteration of the loop as long as `k` is less than `n - 1`.
