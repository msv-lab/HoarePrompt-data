Postcondition: `c` is 2, `ans` is either the integer value of `ans` divided by `arr[l+1]` modulo `MOD` (if `s[k] == 'L'`) or `ans // arr[r-1] % MOD` (if `s[k] != 'L'`), `res[c]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is `n-1`, `l` is incremented by 1 if `s[k] == 'L'`, `r` is decreased by 1 if `s[k] != 'L'`, and `l` and `r` remain unchanged in the respective cases.
