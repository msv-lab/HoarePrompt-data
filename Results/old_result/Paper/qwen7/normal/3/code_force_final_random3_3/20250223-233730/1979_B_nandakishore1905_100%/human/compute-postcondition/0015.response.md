Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is equal to `t`; `m` is the second integer input split from the same input line; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`; `k` is not a power of two and `k` is even; `l` is the string representation of the binary form of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `p` is the length of `l`; `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\); `f` is `k - q`.**

Explanation: The code subtracts \(2^{(p - 1)}\) (which is stored in `q`) from `k` (stored in `f`). All other variables remain unchanged. `k` is represented in binary form as `l`, and its length is `p`. `q` is calculated as \(2^{(p - 1)}\), and `f` is updated to be `k - q`.
