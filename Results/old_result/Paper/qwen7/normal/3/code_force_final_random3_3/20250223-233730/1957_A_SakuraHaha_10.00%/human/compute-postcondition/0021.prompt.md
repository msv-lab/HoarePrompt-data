You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the following list contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a dictionary with multiple key-value pairs where each key is an element from the original list `a` and each value is the count of occurrences of that element in the original list `a`.
    #
    #This final state occurs because the loop iterates over each element in the list `a`, updating the `cnt` dictionary to keep track of how many times each element appears. After all elements have been processed, the list `a` becomes empty, and `cnt` contains the counts of each unique element from the original list.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: `ans` is the sum of `x // 4` for all values `x` in `cnt`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a dictionary with the counts of each unique element from the original list `a`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of integers based on certain constraints. It iterates through a list of n integers (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and each integer a_i in the list satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100. The function does not return any specific value but rather operates on the provided list according to given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
