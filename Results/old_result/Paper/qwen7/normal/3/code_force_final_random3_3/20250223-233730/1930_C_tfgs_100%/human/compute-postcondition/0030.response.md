Output State: **`cur` is reduced by `adv` and `cnt` is reduced by `adv`; `ans` contains `n - 1` elements each calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1)`, `a` remains unchanged, and `j` is `adv - 1` and `ans` is appended with `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[i]` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` originally contained `n - 2` elements, after appending `a[i]`, it now contains `n - 1` elements. The values of `cur`, `cnt`, `a`, and `j` remain unchanged.
