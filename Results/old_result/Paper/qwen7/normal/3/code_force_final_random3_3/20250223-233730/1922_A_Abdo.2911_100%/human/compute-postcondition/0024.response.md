Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, and the elements at index `i` of arrays `a` and `b` are not equal. If `c[0]` is either equal to `a[0]` or `b[0]`, then `c[0]` is set to that value. Otherwise, `c[0]` is neither equal to `a[0]` nor `b[0]`, and `possible` is set to True with the most internal loop or if statement being broken out of.
