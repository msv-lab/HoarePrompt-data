Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is less than `len(paths)`, `n` is an integer, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths` plus `paths[i + 1]` (if `i + 1` is within bounds), `ress` is the maximum value between `ress` and `curr` for all iterations, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop (which in this case never happens), `ps` is now the final value of `p[ps - 1]` after the loop, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of elements added during the loop execution, `paths` is now a list of `k` elements, each being `a[ps - 1]`, `vis[pb - 1]` is marked as visited (set to 1), `resb` is equal to the maximum value of `curr` calculated over all iterations, `ress` is equal to `resb`, `curr` is updated to `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, and we break out of the loop if `k < i + 1`.**

In this output state, the variable `curr` is updated to the value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`. All other variables retain their previous values or states as described in the initial state.
