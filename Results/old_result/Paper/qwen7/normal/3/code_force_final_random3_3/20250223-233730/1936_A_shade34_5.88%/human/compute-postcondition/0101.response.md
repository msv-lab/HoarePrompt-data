Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 5.
- `mak` is explicitly given as 4.
- A string input has been read and its value is less than the character `<`.
- `n` must be greater than 5, but `n` is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

This will print a string followed by the values of `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i`.

- The string `'?'` will be printed first.
- `mak` is 4, so it will be printed twice.
- `i` is 5, so it will be printed twice.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 4 4 5 5**
