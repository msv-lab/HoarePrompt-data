Output State: **`k` is 2, `arr` is [1], `lex` is an input integer less than or equal to 26, `j` must be between 0 and 1 inclusive**

The code appends the integer `1` to the list `arr`, changing its state from being an empty list to `[1]`. The values of `k`, `lex`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
