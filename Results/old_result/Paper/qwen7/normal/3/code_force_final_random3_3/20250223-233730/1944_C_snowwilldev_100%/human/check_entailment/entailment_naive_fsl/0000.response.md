Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that Alice can choose any element from the array `a` on her turn, whereas Bob can only choose elements that are still present in `a`. The current implementation of `func_1` simply counts the occurrences of each number in the array and returns the smallest number that appears exactly once or is missing from the count. This approach does not reflect the strategic nature of the game where Alice and Bob make optimal choices.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```

Expected output:
```
2
```

However, the program outputs:
```
1
```

This happens because the program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Instead, it just counts the occurrences of each number and returns the smallest number that is either unique or missing. In the given example, the program incorrectly assumes that Bob will always pick the smallest available number, leading to an incorrect MEX value.

A correct solution would involve simulating the turns of Alice and Bob to ensure that the game is played optimally according to the rules.
