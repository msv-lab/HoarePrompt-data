Postcondition: `card` is no longer used, `rank` is the rank part of the original `card`, `suit` is the suit part of the original `card`, `trumps` is unchanged, and `answers` now contains one additional element. If `suits[suit]` was `None`, then `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`. Otherwise, `suits[suit]` remains `rank`.
