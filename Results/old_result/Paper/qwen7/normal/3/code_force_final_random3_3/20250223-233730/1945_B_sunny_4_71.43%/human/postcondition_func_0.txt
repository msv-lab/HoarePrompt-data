The function processes a series of test cases (up to 10,000). For each test case, it reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) and calculates two values \(A\) and \(B\) based on these inputs. Specifically, \(A\) is set to \(\text{int}(m / a) + 1\) and \(B\) is set to \(\text{int}(m / b) + 1\). The function then prints the sum \(A + B\) for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
