Reasoning:
1. The problem requires generating an array of integers \(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}\) where each element is either 1, 0, or -1, such that the sum \(x = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i \cdot 2^i\) holds true, and no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
2. The provided code attempts to solve this by converting \(x\) into its binary representation and then applying some transformations to ensure the conditions are met.
3. Let's analyze the key parts of the code:
   - It converts \(x\) into a binary string and appends '0's to make it 30 bits long.
   - It then iterates through the binary string and applies transformations to ensure no two consecutive 1's exist and to convert some 1's to -1's while maintaining the sum.
   - Finally, it adjusts the length and values to ensure the conditions are met.
4. The final state of the program matches the expected behavior:
   - The binary string is transformed correctly to meet the conditions.
   - The length is adjusted appropriately.
   - The output format matches the required format.

Given the analysis, the code appears to correctly implement the logic to generate the required array for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
