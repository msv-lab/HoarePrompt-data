Output State: **`is_already_stairs` remains True, `j` is 2, `i` is 0, `res` contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(start_index, start_index)` to the list `res`. The values of `is_already_stairs`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The list `res` now includes the specified tuple.
