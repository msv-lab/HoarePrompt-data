Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(paths)`, `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - len(paths) + 1)`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `n` is the first input string, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the third input string, `ps` is the fourth input string converted to integer, and we have received four inputs from the user.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into four parts and assigns them to `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. The values of `i`, `curr`, `pres`, and `ress` remain unchanged from their initial state as no operations were performed on these variables within the given code snippet.
