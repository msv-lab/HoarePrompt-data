Output State: `adv` must be greater than 0, `cnt` and `cur` should be such that they allow `adv` to be greater than 0, `ans` now contains `n - 1` elements, and each element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1 - j) - 1` for `j` in the range of `adv`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `adv` will still need to be greater than 0, and both `cnt` and `cur` should support this condition. The list `ans` will contain `n - 1` elements, with each element being the result of subtracting the appropriate index value from `a[i - 1]`. The exact values depend on the initial conditions and the operations performed within the loop.
