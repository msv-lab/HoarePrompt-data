Output State: The `results` list will contain the `best_y` values found for each `x` in `test_cases`. For each `x` in `test_cases`, `best_y` is the largest integer less than `x` such that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `best_y` plus `best_y` is maximized. The `max_sum` variable, which keeps track of the maximum sum found for each `x`, and the `best_y` variable, which stores the corresponding `y` value, will be updated accordingly within each iteration but will not affect the final state of the `results` list. The `gcd_val` variable will hold the GCD of the last `x` and `best_y` found for each `x` in `test_cases`.

In simpler terms, the `results` list will contain the optimal `y` values (less than each `x`) for each `x` in `test_cases`, where the sum of the GCD of `x` and `y` plus `y` is maximized.
