Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- The character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `j`, `n`, and the characters in `s`, as long as the conditions about `j` and `n` hold true.

Output: **YES**
