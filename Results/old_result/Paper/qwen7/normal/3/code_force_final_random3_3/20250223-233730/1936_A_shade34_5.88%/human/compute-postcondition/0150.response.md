Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `i` is set to `n-1`.
   - `n` must be such that `n-1` is within the range `1` to `len(pans)`.
   - `pans` is a list containing all integers from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the Value of `n`:**
   - Since `i` is `n-1`, and `i` must be within the range `1` to `len(pans)`, it implies that `n-1` must be within the range `1` to `len(pans)`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be within the range `2` to `len(pans) + 1`.

3. **Determine the Value of `pans`:**
   - `pans` contains all integers from `0` to `n-1`.
   - For example, if `n = 4`, then `pans` would be `[0, 1, 2, 3]`.

4. **Identify the Variables in the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement uses `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]`.
   - Since `i` is `n-1`, and `mak` is not defined in the initial state, we need to assume that `mak` is also within the range `0` to `n-1` (as it should be valid for accessing `pans`).

5. **Determine the Values of `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]`:**
   - `pans[i]` is `pans[n-1]`, which is the last element in the list `pans`.
   - `pans[mak]` could be any element in the list `pans`, but since it is not specified, we will leave it as `pans[mak]`.

6. **Construct the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])`.
   - This will print the string `'?'` followed by the value of `pans[mak]` twice, and the value of `pans[i]` twice.

Given the above analysis, the output will be:

Output: **'? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[n-1]] [pans[n-1]]' (where `pans[mak]` is any element in the list `pans` and `pans[n-1]` is the last element in the list `pans`)**
