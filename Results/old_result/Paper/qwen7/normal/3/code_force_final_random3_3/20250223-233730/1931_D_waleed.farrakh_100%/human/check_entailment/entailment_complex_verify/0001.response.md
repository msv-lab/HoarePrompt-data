### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We need to find pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) such that \(1 \le i < j \le n\).
- A pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered "beautiful" if:
  - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
  - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

#### Key Observations
- For a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful:
  - \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x} \Rightarrow a_j \equiv -a_i \pmod{x}\)
  - \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y} \Rightarrow a_j \equiv a_i \pmod{y}\)

#### Simplified Approach
- We need to check if there exists an index \(j > i\) such that:
  - \(a_j \equiv -a_i \pmod{x}\)
  - \(a_j \equiv a_i \pmod{y}\)

#### Code Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**
   - Initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to store the counts of remainders.
   - Iterates through each element \(a_i\) in the array.
   - Calculates the remainders \(rx = (-a_i \mod x + x) \mod x\) and \(ry = a_i \mod y\).
   - Checks if the pair \((rx, ry)\) exists in the frequency dictionary and updates the count accordingly.
   - Updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair \((a_i \mod x, a_i \mod y)\).

2. **Function `func_2`**
   - Reads the input from standard input.
   - Splits the input into test cases.
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.

#### Detailed Verification

1. **Frequency Dictionary Calculation**
   - The calculation of \(rx = (-a_i \mod x + x) \mod x\) ensures that \(rx\) is always non-negative.
   - This step handles negative values correctly by adding \(x\) to the remainder if it is negative.

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**
   - The logic for counting pairs \((a_i, a_j)\) that satisfy the conditions is correct.
   - The use of the frequency dictionary ensures that we efficiently count the pairs without redundant calculations.

3. **Input Reading and Processing**
   - The input reading and splitting into test cases is handled correctly.
   - Each test case is processed independently and the results are printed correctly.

Based on the detailed verification, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
