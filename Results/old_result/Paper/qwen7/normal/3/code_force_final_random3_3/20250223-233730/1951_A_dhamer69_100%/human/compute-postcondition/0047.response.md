Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `s`, or `count_1`. If `count_1` is even and `s` does not contain exactly one instance of '11', no specific changes are made either.
