Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `buffer` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
    if n >= 3:
        q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]
        for j in range(n):
            q[w[j]] += 1
        eta = []
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if q[j] > 0:
                eta.append(j)
        eta_ln = len(eta)
        rho = q[eta[0]]
        if eta_ln == 1:
            print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
        else:
            res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
            for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                rho += q[eta[j]]
            print(res)
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `buffer` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, and if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `eta` is a list containing the integers `1`, `1`, and `3`; `q` is a list where each element `q[j]` (for `j` from `0` to `n`) has been decremented by `1` for each iteration where `q[j]` was greater than `0`; `rho` is `q[1]`, `j` is `n+1`, `n` remains unchanged, `eta_ln` is `1` if the condition `eta_ln == 1` is true, and `res` is calculated as specified. If `n` is less than 3, `t`, `buffer`, `i`, `n`, and `w` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an input integer, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `buffer` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `w` is updated to a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `eta` is a list of integers, `q` is a list where each element `q[j]` (for `j` from `0` to `n`) has been decremented by `1` for each iteration where `q[j]` was greater than `0`, `rho` is `q[1]`, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is less than 3, `eta` is a list containing the integers `1`, `1`, and `3` only if `n` is not greater than or equal to 3, `eta_ln` is `1` if the condition `eta_ln == 1` is true, and `res` is calculated as specified. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `rho` is equal to the sum of all elements in the list `eta`, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from `range(n + 1)` for which `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, and `j` is equal to `eta_ln`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is equal to `n + eta_ln`, `eta_ln` remains the same, `res` is updated according to the specified rules, and `rho` is updated accordingly. If `n` is less than 3, `i` remains 3, `n` remains the same, and `w` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
