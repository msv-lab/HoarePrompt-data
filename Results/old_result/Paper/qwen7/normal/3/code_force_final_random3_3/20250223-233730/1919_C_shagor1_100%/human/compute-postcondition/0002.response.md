Functionality: **The function processes a set of test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. For each test case, it determines and returns a specific value or result based on the given conditions. The function ensures that the input constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) are met and that the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**
