Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input split.

The expression to be evaluated in the `print` statement is `2 + m // b`.

Here, `m // b` represents integer division of `m` by `b`. Since `m` and `b` are integers from the input, their division result will also be an integer.

Given that the exact values of `m` and `b` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical result of `m // b`. However, we know it will be an integer.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2 + [m // b]** (where `[m // b]` is the integer result of dividing `m` by `b`)
