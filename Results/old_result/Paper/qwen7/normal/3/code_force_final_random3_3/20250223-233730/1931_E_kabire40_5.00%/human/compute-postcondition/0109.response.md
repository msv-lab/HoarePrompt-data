Postcondition: `x` is an integer equal to `len(rev_val)`, `rev_val` remains unchanged as a list, and `rev_res` is a string. For each index `i` in `rev_val`:
- If `i` is even, the string representation of `rev_val[i]` is appended to `rev_res`.
- If `i` is odd, the reverse of `rev_val[i]` is concatenated to `rev_res`.

The maximum power represented by `max_power` is less than or equal to the length of `rev_res`.
