### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, you and Nene, who play a card game with a deck of 2n cards. Each player starts with n cards, and they take turns placing cards on a table to score points. Nene always plays optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum number of points you can get given the cards in your hand.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each card in your hand.
   - It counts how many cards appear exactly twice (i.e., pairs) and returns the minimum of this count and `n // 2`.
   - This logic aligns with the optimal strategy for you: if you have at least `n // 2` pairs, you can ensure at least `n // 2` points by always playing a card that matches a card already on the table.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads input from standard input, processes it, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over the input data and processing each test case individually.
   - It ensures that the input data is read and processed correctly, and the results are printed in the correct order.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and correctly implements the optimal strategy for you.
   - The implementation in `func_2` is correct and processes the input data as expected.
   - The final output matches the expected format and values given in the example.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
