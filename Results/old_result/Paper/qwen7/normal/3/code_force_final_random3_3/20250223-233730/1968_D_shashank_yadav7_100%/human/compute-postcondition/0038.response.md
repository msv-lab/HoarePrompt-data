Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is decreased by 1, and `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`**.

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the value of `p[s] - 1`. The values of `i`, `k`, `b`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `s` while keeping the other variables as they were initially.
