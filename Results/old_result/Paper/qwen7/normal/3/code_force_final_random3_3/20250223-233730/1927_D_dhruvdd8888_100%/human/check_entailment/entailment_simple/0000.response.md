### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`tc`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`N`), the array itself (`nums`), and the number of queries (`q`).
   - It appends `-1` to `nums` to handle the last element in the array more easily.

2. **Finding Transition Points**:
   - The program iterates through the array to find points where the value changes.
   - It stores these transition points in the list `arr` as tuples `(1 + s, i, num)`, where `s` is the start index of the current segment and `i` is the end index of the current segment, and `num` is the value at the start of the segment.
   - This step correctly identifies segments where the array has the same value.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the first segment that starts at or after `l`.
   - It then checks if the start of this segment is within the query range `[l, r]`.
   - Depending on the position of `s` and `e` relative to `l` and `r`, it prints the appropriate indices or `-1 -1` if no valid pair exists.

### Analysis of Correctness:

1. **Transition Point Identification**:
   - The code correctly identifies segments where the array has the same value.
   - The list `arr` captures all transitions accurately.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - The use of `bisect_left` ensures that the search for the correct segment is efficient.
   - The logic for determining valid pairs `(i, j)` is correct. It checks if there is any change in value within the query range `[l, r]`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like when the start of the segment is outside the query range or when the end of the segment is outside the query range.
   - It correctly prints `-1 -1` when no valid pair exists.

### Conclusion:

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the required functionality without any logical errors or omissions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
