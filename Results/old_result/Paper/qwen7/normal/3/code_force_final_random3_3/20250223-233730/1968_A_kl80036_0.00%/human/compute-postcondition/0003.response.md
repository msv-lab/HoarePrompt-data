Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `x` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.
- `y` is calculated as `x // 2`, which means `y` is the integer division of `x` by 2.

The print statement `print(y)` will output the value of `y`.

Since `y` is `x // 2`, the output will be the integer result of dividing `x` by 2.

Output: **y (where y is the integer division of x by 2)**
