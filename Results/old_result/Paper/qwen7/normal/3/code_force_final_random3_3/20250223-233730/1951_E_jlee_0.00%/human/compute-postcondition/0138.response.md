Postcondition: `done` is `True`, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with the first character assigned to `x`, `n` is 1, `count` is 1, `count2` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `count` is greater than 1 and `s[j]` equals `s[n - 1 - j]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `count` is set to `count2`.
