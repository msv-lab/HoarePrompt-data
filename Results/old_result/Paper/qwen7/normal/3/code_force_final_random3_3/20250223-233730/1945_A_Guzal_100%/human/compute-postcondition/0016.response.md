Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers inputted from the user, `k` is either `a + (b + c) // 3` or `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`, depending on whether `(b + c) % 3` equals 0 or not, and `b` is either not divisible by 3 with `b % 3 + c` less than 3 or divisible by 3.
