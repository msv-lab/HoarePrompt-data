Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is equal to `n`, where `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `cnt` is the count of elements in list `b` that are less than the element `a[i]`.
- If all elements in `b` have been processed (i.e., `j` equals `n`), then `i` will be equal to the number of times `i` was incremented during the loop's execution.

Since `j` is equal to `n`, it means that the loop has completed its execution, and all elements in `b` have been processed. Therefore, `cnt` is the final count of elements in `b` that are less than `a[i]`.

Given this information, the `print(cnt)` statement will print the value of `cnt`.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the count of elements in list b that are less than the element a[i])**
