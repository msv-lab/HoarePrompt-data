Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n - 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not explicitly given, but it starts from 0 in the range function.
   - `n` is given as an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, the loop will execute if `i < n - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` should be 0 initially, and `n - 1` should be a positive integer.

Given the constraints and the initial state, we need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is 0 and `n - 1` is a positive integer.

**State:**
- `i` is **0**
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), ensuring `n - 1` is a positive integer

So, the final state to ensure the loop can execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\)**
