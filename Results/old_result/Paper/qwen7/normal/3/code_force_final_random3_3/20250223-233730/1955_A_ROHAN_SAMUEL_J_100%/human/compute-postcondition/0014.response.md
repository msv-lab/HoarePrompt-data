Output: **a * n (where a is the second integer input and n is an even number)**

Explanation:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), but this value does not affect the print statement directly.
- `n` is an even number, so it has a specific value but we don't know the exact number.
- `a` is the second integer input, so it has a specific value based on user input.
- `b` is the third integer input and its value is greater than twice the value of `a`, but again, this does not affect the print statement directly.

The print statement `print(a * n)` will output the product of `a` and `n`. Since `n` is an even number and `a` is the second integer input, the output will be the product of these two values.
