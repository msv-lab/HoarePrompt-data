### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop to process each test case individually. This is appropriate given the problem statement.

2. **Variable Initialization**: The variable `v` is initialized to store the indices of the friends, including a dummy value at index 0. This is done correctly.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: For the case when `n == 2`, the program correctly prints `2` because both friends are best friends with each other and thus both need to be invited.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates through each friend to check if there exists a pair of friends who are best friends of each other and also get invited.
   - If such a pair is found (`v[v[v[i]]] == i`), the program prints `2` and returns, which is correct.
   - If no such pair is found after iterating through all friends, the program prints `3`.

5. **Output Validation**:
   - The output for the given examples matches the expected results:
     - For `n = 5` and `p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`, the output is `2` because friends 4 and 5 are best friends of each other.
     - For `n = 4` and `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`, the output is `3` because no direct best friend pairs are found, and inviting any single friend does not guarantee at least 2 friends coming.
     - For `n = 2` and `p = [2, 1]`, the output is `2` because both friends are best friends of each other.

6. **Loop and Condition Checks**: The loop and conditions are correctly implemented to ensure that the minimum number of invitations is determined accurately.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program logic and handling of edge cases are correct. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of invitations required for at least 2 friends to come to the party.

**Correctness: True**
