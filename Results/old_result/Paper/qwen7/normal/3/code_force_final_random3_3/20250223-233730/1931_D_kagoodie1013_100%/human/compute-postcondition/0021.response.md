Output State: **`test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple; `results` is an empty list; `count` is updated to the sum of the previous count and the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, where `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x` and `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`; `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(new_r_x, new_r_y)` having a value of 1, where `new_r_x` and `new_r_y` are derived from the new `num`; `current_key` is set to `num % x, num % y`; `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`; `residue_map[current_key]` is updated to the value of `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`.**

In more detail:
- The `residue_map` dictionary's entry for the current key (`current_key`) is incremented by 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
