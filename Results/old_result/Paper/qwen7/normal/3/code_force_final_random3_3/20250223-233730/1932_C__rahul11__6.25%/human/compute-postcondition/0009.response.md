Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `arr`. The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `arr`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arr` must have at least one element.
   - `ans` is multiplied by the first element of `arr`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is iterating over `arr`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken the value of the first element of `arr`.
   - For the loop to continue, `arr` must have at least one element remaining. Since `i` has taken the value of the first element, `arr` must now have at least one element left.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `arr` must have at least one element remaining.
   - `ans` is now multiplied by the first element of the remaining `arr`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`arr` must have at least one element, `ans` is multiplied by the first element of `arr`**
