Output State: `max_beauty` is increased by the sum of absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to `left`, `i` is `left`, `n` is `left + 1`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `n-1`. Given the initial conditions and the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that `n` is set to `left + 1` and increases with each iteration. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `left`, meaning the loop has processed all elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to `left`. Therefore, `max_beauty` will be the sum of the absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to `left`.
