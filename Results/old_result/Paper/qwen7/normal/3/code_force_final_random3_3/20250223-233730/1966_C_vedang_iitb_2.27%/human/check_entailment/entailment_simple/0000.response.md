### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game where players take turns removing a certain number of stones from each non-empty pile, with the player who cannot make a move losing. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the Nim game theory, specifically the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes).

2. **Analyzed Functions**:
   - **`func_1`**: This function aims to transform the list `a` into a new list `a_new` where each element (starting from the second) is adjusted to reflect the difference between its original value and the cumulative sum of all preceding elements. However, this transformation is not necessary for solving the problem using Nim game theory.
   - **`func_2`**: This function uses recursion to determine the winner based on the number of piles (`n`) and the current state of the piles (`a`). It checks specific conditions for small values of `n` and recursively determines the winner for larger values of `n`.

3. **Nim Game Theory**:
   - For a single pile, the player who starts always wins.
   - For two piles, if the XOR of the two pile sizes is zero, the second player wins; otherwise, the first player wins.
   - For more than two piles, the player whose turn it is can always force a win if the Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes) is non-zero. If the Nim-sum is zero, the player whose turn it is will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

4. **Verification**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly implements the logic for determining the winner based on the Nim-sum principle for different numbers of piles.
   - The transformation in `func_1` is unnecessary and does not align with the Nim-sum approach. However, since the main logic for determining the winner is correctly implemented in `func_2`, the overall correctness of the program is not affected.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the Nim-sum principle, even though the intermediate transformation in `func_1` is unnecessary. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
