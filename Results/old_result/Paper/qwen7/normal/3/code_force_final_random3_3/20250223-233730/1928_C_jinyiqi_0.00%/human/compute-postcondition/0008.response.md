Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - `x` is an integer
   - `i` is an integer
   - `x` is divisible by `i`
   - Either `output1` is a list containing the value of `i`, and `output2` is a list containing the value of `int(x / i)`, or no lists are modified since there is no else part provided.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop head is:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range from `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

5. **State Adjustment**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was within this range. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and still be within the range.

6. **Determining the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be `k + 1`.
   - Since `i` must still be within the range, `k + 1` must be less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

7. **Final State**:
   - `x` remains an integer.
   - `i` is now `k + 1` (where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration).
   - `x` is still divisible by `i` (since the divisibility condition is checked in the loop body).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is an integer and equals k + 1, and `x` is divisible by `i`**, where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we express it symbolically. If `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, then:

State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is an integer and equals `i + 1`, and `x` is divisible by `i + 1`**.
