Postcondition: `i` will be equal to `len(paths)`, `curr` will be `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - len(paths) + 1)`, `pres` will be the sum of all elements in `paths`, and `ress` will store the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, then `ress` will be updated to `resb`. Otherwise, `ress` will remain unchanged.
