Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, len(pans))`.

   - The variable `i` is being iterated over the range starting from 1 up to but not including `len(pans)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `mak` is currently 1 (or remains unchanged based on the condition).

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(pans)`.
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` would be 2.
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than `len(pans)` for the loop to execute again.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `mak` will remain unchanged unless the input string is '>', but since no such condition is mentioned for the next iteration, it will stay as 1.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `mak` is 1**
