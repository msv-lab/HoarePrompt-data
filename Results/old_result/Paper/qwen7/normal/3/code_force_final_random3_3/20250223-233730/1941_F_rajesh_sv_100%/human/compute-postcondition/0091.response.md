Output State: **`mid_sum` is updated to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is updated to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `ans` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `h` remains unchanged, `mid` remains unchanged, `mid_sum` remains unchanged, `mid_next_sum` remains unchanged, `left` remains unchanged, `right` remains unchanged, `f` remains unchanged, `D` remains unchanged, `l < h` must still hold true.**

This means that the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` have been updated according to the new expressions, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
