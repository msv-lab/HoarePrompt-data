Output State: `cnt` is 6, `i` is 5, `m` must be at least 3, `x` is -21, `y` is 25.

Explanation: The loop continues until `i` exceeds `m`. From the given information, we can see that after 3 iterations, `i` is 4 and `m` must be at least 3. For the loop to complete all its iterations, it needs to run for `m` values from 1 to the final value of `i` which is 4 in this case. Therefore, the loop will run 4 times in total. 

- After 1st iteration: `cnt` = 2, `i` = 2, `x` = `n - 1`, `y` = 4
- After 2nd iteration: `cnt` = 5, `i` = 3, `x` = `n - 8`, `y` = 9
- After 3rd iteration: `cnt` = 8, `i` = 4, `x` = -8, `y` = 16

For the 4th iteration:
- `i` = 5
- `x` = `n - (5 * 5 - 5)` = `n - 20`
- `y` = `5 * 5` = 25
- `cnt` = `8 + math.ceil((-20) / 25) + ((-20) % 25 == 0)` = `8 + 0 + 0` = 8

Thus, after the loop completes all its iterations, `cnt` will be 8, `i` will be 5, `m` must be at least 3, `x` will be `-21` (since `n - 20 - 1`), and `y` will be 25.
