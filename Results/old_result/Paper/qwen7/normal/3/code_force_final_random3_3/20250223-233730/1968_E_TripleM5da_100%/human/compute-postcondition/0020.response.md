Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `3` to `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\)
   - `i` is 7
   - `n` must be at least 9

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 7, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since it starts from 3 and increments by 1 each time).
   - Therefore, `i` will become 8.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be at least 9.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` becomes 8.
   - `n` must still be at least 9.

So, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 8, `n` must be at least 9**
