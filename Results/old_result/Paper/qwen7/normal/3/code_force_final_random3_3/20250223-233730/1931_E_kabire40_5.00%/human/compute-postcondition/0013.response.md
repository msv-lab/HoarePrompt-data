Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable `x` is taken from the `operational_list`. No other variables are directly modified within the loop head.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `operational_list`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `rev_val`: Either an empty list or a list containing the reversed string of `x` (`'x_reversed'`).
   - `rev_res`: Either the original string `x` or an empty string.
   - `list_len`: Length of the input string.
   - `max_power`: Maximum power of the input string.
   - `operational_list`: A non-empty list created from the split input.
   - `x_rev`: Integer value of the reversed string `x`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `x` is taken from `operational_list`, and the loop continues as long as `operational_list` is not empty, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `operational_list`.
   - After each iteration, one element is processed from `operational_list`, so `operational_list` will have one less element.

5. **New State**:
   - `rev_val`: Remains the same unless the loop body changes it.
   - `rev_res`: Remains the same unless the loop body changes it.
   - `list_len`: Remains the same unless the loop body changes it.
   - `max_power`: Remains the same unless the loop body changes it.
   - `operational_list`: Has one less element.
   - `x_rev`: Remains the same unless the loop body changes it.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `operational_list` has one less element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`rev_val` is either an empty list or a list containing the reversed string of `x` (`'x_reversed'`), `rev_res` is either the original string `x` or an empty string, `list_len` is the length of the input string, `max_power` is the maximum power of the input string, `operational_list` is a list created from the split input and now has one less element, and `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`.**
