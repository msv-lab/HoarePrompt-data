Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of integers based on certain constraints. It iterates through a list of n integers (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and each integer a_i in the list satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100. The function does not return any specific value but rather operates on the provided list according to given conditions.**
