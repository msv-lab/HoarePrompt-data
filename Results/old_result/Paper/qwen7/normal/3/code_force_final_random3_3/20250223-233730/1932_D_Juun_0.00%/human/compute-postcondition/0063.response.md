Output State: **`suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is a suit and the value is either `None` or a rank; `answers` is a list with two elements where the first element is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop(){trump}' and the second element is a new string formatted as '{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}', `trumps` is a list with one element less than before, and we continue the loop if `rank` is `None`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new formatted string to the `answers` list. The new string is created using the `rank`, `suit`, `trumps.pop()`, and `trump` from the existing `answers` list. The `trumps` list loses one element due to `trumps.pop()`. The conditions for continuing the loop remain the same, specifically depending on whether `rank` is `None`.
