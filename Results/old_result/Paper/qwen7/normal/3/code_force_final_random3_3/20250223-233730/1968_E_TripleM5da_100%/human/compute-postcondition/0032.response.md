Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state defines that `t` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
2. The value of `i` is explicitly stated to be 3.
3. The variable `n` is mentioned to be "at least 13," but its exact value is not relevant to the print statement.

The print statement is `print(i, i)`. Given that `i` is 3, this will print the value of `i` twice.

Output: **3 3**
