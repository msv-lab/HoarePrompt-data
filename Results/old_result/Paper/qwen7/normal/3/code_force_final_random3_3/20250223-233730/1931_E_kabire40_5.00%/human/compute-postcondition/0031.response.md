Output State: **`len(rev_val)` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `x % 2` is not equal to 0, `rev_res` is equal to `val_in[::-1]`, `val_in` is equal to `rev_val[0]`**

Explanation: The code `rev_res += val_in[::-1]` appends the reverse of `val_in` to `rev_res`. Given that `val_in` is equal to `rev_val[0]`, `rev_res` will now be equal to the reverse of `val_in`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
