Output State: The `cntl` list will have its elements incremented based on the values present in the list `a`. Specifically, for each element `i` in `a`, the corresponding index `i` in `cntl` will be incremented by 1. After all iterations of the loop, `cntl[i]` will represent how many times the value `i` appears in the list `a`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `cntl` list will contain counts of how many times each integer from the original list `a` appears. Each element `cntl[i]` will show the frequency of the integer `i` in the list `a`.
