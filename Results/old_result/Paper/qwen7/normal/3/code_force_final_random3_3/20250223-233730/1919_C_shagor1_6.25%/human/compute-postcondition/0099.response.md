Output State: **`a` is the last element of the tuple `inp`, `a` is greater than `x`, `a` is greater than `y`, and `y` is equal to `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a` to `y`. Since `a` was initially greater than both `x` and `y`, and `x` was equal to `y`, after the assignment, `y` now holds the value of `a`. All other conditions and relationships remain unchanged.
