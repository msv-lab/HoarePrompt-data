Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in how it counts the number of elements that are less than or equal to `k` in both arrays `a` and `b`. Specifically, the current implementation does not correctly handle the case where the arrays have different lengths. Here's why the solution is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Counting Logic**: The loop iterates up to `max(len_a, len_b)` but does not ensure that the indices are within the bounds of both arrays. This means that if one array is shorter, it will still attempt to access elements beyond its length, leading to incorrect counts.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The logic to check if an element is less than or equal to `k` and increment the count should be done separately for each array without assuming they have the same length. Instead, it should iterate through each array independently until it finds enough elements.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize counters for elements <= k in both arrays
        count_a = sum(1 for x in a if x <= k)
        count_b = sum(1 for x in b if x <= k)
        
        # Check if we can find at least k/2 elements in each array
        if count_a >= k // 2 and count_b >= k // 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This corrected version directly counts the number of elements in each array that are less than or equal to `k` and checks if there are at least `k // 2` such elements in both arrays. This approach ensures that the solution works correctly regardless of the lengths of the arrays.
