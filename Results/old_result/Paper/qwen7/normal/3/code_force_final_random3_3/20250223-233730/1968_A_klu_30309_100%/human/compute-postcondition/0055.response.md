Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `gcd_val + y - 2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y - 2`, `best_y` is `y - 1`, `results` list still contains 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y - 1`, `y` is `y - 2**.

Explanation: The line `max_sum = current_sum` updates `max_sum` to be equal to the current value of `current_sum`. Given that `current_sum` was defined as `gcd_val + y`, and considering the changes in `y` and the fact that `current_sum` is now updated to `gcd_val + (y - 2)`, `max_sum` also becomes `gcd_val + y - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
