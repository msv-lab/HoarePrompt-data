Output State: All elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` in the array `arr` are set to values starting from `small_element` and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent element; `cliquess` at indices from `left` to `left + mid - 1` are all set to the value `clique`. The variable `mid` remains greater than 0 after the loop completes, indicating that there were enough elements to iterate over according to the initial conditions.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the array `arr` will have its elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` filled with values starting from `small_element` up to `small_element + mid - 1`, and the corresponding indices in the `cliquess` array will all be set to the `clique` identifier.
