Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string; `res` is 0; `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`**.

This means that the variable `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. The other variables retain their initial states.
