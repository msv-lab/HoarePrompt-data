Postcondition: `a` is the first element of the tuple `inp`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an updated input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `x` and `y` are both \(n + 1\). If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is set to `a`, `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether `a` is less than or equal to `y`, and `x` is not equal to `y`.
