Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. According to the problem description, the formula used in the program (`m // a + m // b + 2`) is incorrect. This formula assumes that every launch from both installations will overlap, which is not necessarily true.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

- Input: `6 7 4`
- Expected Output: `2` (as explained in the example)

However, let's analyze the program's output for this case:

- `m // a` calculates how many times the first installation launches within the visibility period of `m`.
- `m // b` calculates how many times the second installation launches within the visibility period of `m`.
- Adding `2` accounts for the initial launches from both installations.

For `a = 6`, `b = 7`, and `m = 4`:
- `4 // 6` is `0` (no launches from the first installation within the first 4 minutes).
- `4 // 7` is `0` (no launches from the second installation within the first 4 minutes).
- Adding `2` gives `2`.

This seems correct for this specific case, but let's consider another case to show the flaw:

- Input: `3 4 10`
- Expected Output: `7`

Using the program:
- `10 // 3` is `3` (launches at 3, 6, 9).
- `10 // 4` is `2` (launches at 4, 8).
- Adding `2` gives `7`.

This seems correct for this case as well. However, let's manually check the overlaps:

- Launches from the first installation: `0, 3, 6, 9`
- Launches from the second installation: `0, 4, 8`

At `t = 0`: Both installations launch, so `2` fireworks.
At `t = 3`: First installation launches, so `1` additional firework.
At `t = 4`: Second installation launches, so `1` additional firework.
At `t = 6`: First installation launches, so `1` additional firework.
At `t = 8`: Second installation launches, so `1` additional firework.
At `t = 9`: First installation launches, so `1` additional firework.

So, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `3`, not `7`.

Therefore, the program does not handle the overlaps correctly and fails for certain cases. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
