Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value 0.**

The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `cnt` with a default factory function set to `int`. This means that `cnt` is a dictionary where any key that does not exist will automatically be assigned a value of `0`. No changes are made to the values of `t`, `N`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
