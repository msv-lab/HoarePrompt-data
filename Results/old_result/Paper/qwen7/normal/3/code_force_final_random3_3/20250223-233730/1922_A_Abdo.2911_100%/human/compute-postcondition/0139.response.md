Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `b` are not equal. If `c[0]` is either equal to `a[0]` or `b[0]`, then `c[0]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `c[0]` is neither equal to `a[0]` nor `b[0]`, and `possible` is True with the most internal loop or if statement broken.
