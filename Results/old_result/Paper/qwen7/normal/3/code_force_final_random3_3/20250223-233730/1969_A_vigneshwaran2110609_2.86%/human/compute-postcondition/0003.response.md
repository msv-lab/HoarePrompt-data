Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` takes a line of input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the line into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list `l`. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `x` remains an input integer, though its specific value is not known without further input.
