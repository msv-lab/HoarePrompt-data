Output State: **`max_sum` is `gcd_val + (y-1)`, `best_y` is `y`, `x` retains its original value, `y` is decremented by 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y-1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (y-1)**.

Explanation: The line `best_y = y` assigns the current value of `y` to `best_y`. All other variables retain their previous values as per the initial state.
