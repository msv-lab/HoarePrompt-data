Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is the length of `test_cases[4]`, `arr` is `test_cases[4]`, `results` is [5], `operations` is 5, `heap` is now a min-heap containing `arr[median_index + 1:]` with the smallest element being `current_median + 1 + 5`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `smallest + 1`, `smallest` is the second smallest element from the original heap after removing the smallest element twice.**

Explanation: The code assigns `n` and `arr` from `test_cases[i]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is only used as an index. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
