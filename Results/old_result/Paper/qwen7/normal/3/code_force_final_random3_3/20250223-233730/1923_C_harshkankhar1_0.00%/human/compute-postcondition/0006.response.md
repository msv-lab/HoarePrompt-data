Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `x` is 2
   - `b[1]` is 2

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i` to `n + 1`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

4. **Analyze the state changes**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The value of `n` must remain the same as it was at the beginning of the loop.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

6. **Consider other variables**: The variable `x` and `b[1]` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop continuation. Therefore, they remain unchanged.

Based on this analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
