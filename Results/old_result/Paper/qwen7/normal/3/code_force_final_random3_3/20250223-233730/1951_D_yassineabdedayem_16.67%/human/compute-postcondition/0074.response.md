Output State: **`rep` is increased by 1, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is adjusted based on the condition, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `number` is either `Min` or `Max` depending on whether `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k` holds true; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The line `rep += 1` increments the value of `rep` by 1. No other variables are directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the value of `rep` is increased by 1, while the values of `n`, `k`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`, and `tab` remain unchanged from their initial states.
