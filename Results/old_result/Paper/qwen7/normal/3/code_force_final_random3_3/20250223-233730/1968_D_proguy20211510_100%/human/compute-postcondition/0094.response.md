Output State: **`pres` is equal to `paths[4] * (k - 3) + paths[i + 1]`, `curr` is the result of `pres + paths[i + 1] * (k - (i + 1))`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`, `i` is `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block that was modifying the variables `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, and `i`. The values of these variables before the `break` statement are preserved, and the loop or conditional block is exited.
