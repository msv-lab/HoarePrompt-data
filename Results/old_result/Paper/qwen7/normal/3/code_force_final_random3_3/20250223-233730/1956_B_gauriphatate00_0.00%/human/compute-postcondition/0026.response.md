To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the loop head and identify the relevant variables and their initial states.

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop head is:
```python
for result in results:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Relevant Variables
The relevant variables in the loop head are:
- `result`: This is the variable that will take each element from the `results` list in each iteration of the loop.

### Initial States
- `data` remains unchanged.
- `idx` is `idx + 3 * n`.
- `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx-3*n:idx-2*n]` converted using `map(int, ...)`.
- `results` is a list with elements from each iteration of `func_1(n, a)` appended, totaling `t` elements.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **`data`**: Since `data` remains unchanged, no adjustment is needed for `data`.
2. **`idx`**: The loop starts with `idx` being `idx + 3 * n`. Therefore, `idx` should be set to `idx + 3 * n` before the loop starts.
3. **`a`**: The value of `a` is determined by the current state of `idx` and `data`. Specifically, `a` is derived from `data[idx-3*n:idx-2*n]`. Since `idx` is already adjusted to `idx + 3 * n`, the correct slice for `a` would be `data[(idx - 3 * n) - 3 * n:(idx - 3 * n) - 2 * n]`, which simplifies to `data[idx - 6 * n:idx - 5 * n]`.
4. **`results`**: The loop iterates over each element in `results`, which means `results` must contain `t` elements. Each element in `results` is the output of `func_1(n, a)` for the corresponding iteration.

### Final Adjusted State
Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `idx` should be set to `idx + 3 * n`.
- `a` should be derived from `data[idx - 6 * n:idx - 5 * n]`.
- `results` should contain `t` elements.

Thus, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`data` remains unchanged, `idx` is `idx + 3 * n`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx - 6 * n:idx - 5 * n]` converted using `map(int, ...)`, `results` is a list with `t` elements.**
