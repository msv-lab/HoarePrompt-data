Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `cnt` is 0**

Explanation: The code sets `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `ans`, `i`, or `n`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` remains valid. The value of `cnt` is now explicitly set to 0.
