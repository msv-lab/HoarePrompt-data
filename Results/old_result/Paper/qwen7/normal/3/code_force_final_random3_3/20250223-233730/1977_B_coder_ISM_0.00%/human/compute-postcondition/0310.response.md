Output State: `i` is 30, `length` is 32, `flag` is 1, `s[0]` is '-1', `s[1]` is '1', `s[2]` is '0', for all `i` from 3 to 28, `s[i]` is '0', `s[29]` is '1', `s[29]` is '1', `s[30]` is '0', and `s[31]` is '-1'.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be 30 because the loop increments `i` starting from 1 and continues until it can no longer find a pair where `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1'. The `flag` variable will be 1 since the last modification to `s` involved changing `s[29]` to '0' and appending '1' to increase `length`. The initial pattern of `-1 1 0 0 ... 0 1 1` remains unchanged except for the modifications made during each iteration, resulting in the final state described.
