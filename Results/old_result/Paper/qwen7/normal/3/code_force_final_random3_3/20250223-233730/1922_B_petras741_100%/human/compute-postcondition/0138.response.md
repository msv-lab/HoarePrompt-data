Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n`. The loop will continue as long as `j < n + 1`.
3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is `j + 1` (meaning `j` was incremented by 1).
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `q[j]` is a value greater than 0.
   - `eta` is a list with the value `j` appended.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `j + 2` (because it will increment by 1 again).
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `q[j]` must still be greater than 0.
   - `eta` will have the new value of `j` appended to it, so the new value of `j` (which is `j + 2`) will be appended to `eta`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is `j + 2`, `n` is a positive integer, `q[j]` is a value greater than 0, `eta` is a list with the values `j` and `j + 1` appended**.
