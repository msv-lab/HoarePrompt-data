Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory list, `i` is 2, `nodes[u]` includes `v`**

Explanation: The code appends `v` to the list associated with `u` in the `nodes` dictionary. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
