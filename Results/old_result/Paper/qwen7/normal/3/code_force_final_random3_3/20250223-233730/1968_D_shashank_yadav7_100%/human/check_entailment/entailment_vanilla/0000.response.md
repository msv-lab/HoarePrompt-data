Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` (starting positions for Bodya and Sasha).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Starting Positions:**
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 because array indices start from 0.

3. **Initial Scores Calculation:**
   - The initial scores for Bodya (`sp`) and Sasha (`bp`) are set to the values at their starting positions.
   - The maximum possible scores for Bodya (`bm`) and Sasha (`sm`) are initialized to the initial scores multiplied by `k`.

4. **Game Loop:**
   - The loop runs for `k` iterations.
   - In each iteration:
     - The positions of Bodya and Sasha are updated to their new positions based on the permutation `p`.
     - The scores are updated accordingly.
     - The maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha are updated using the new positions and scores.

5. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After the loop, the program compares the final maximum possible scores (`bm` and `sm`).
   - It prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, and 'Draw' if they are equal.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Initialization:**
   - The initial scores are correctly set to the values at the starting positions.
   - The maximum possible scores are correctly initialized to the initial scores multiplied by `k`.

2. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop correctly updates the positions and scores for each turn.
   - The maximum possible scores are updated correctly to account for the best possible outcomes for each player.

3. **Final Comparison:**
   - The final comparison between `bm` and `sm` is correct and determines the winner.

### Edge Cases

- **Single Turn (`k=1`):** The program handles this correctly by comparing the initial scores directly.
- **Multiple Turns:** The program correctly simulates the game for multiple turns and updates the scores and positions accordingly.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic is correct and handles all aspects of the problem as described. The program correctly calculates the scores for both players and determines the winner based on the given rules.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
