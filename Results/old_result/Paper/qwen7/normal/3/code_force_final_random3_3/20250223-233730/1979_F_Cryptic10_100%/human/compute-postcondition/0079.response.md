Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `(v1, v2) in ops[::-1]`. This means the loop iterates over the reversed list `ops`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `vx` is an empty set.
   - `ops` is a list that must have at least one element.
   - `v1` and `v2` are the first tuple in `ops`.
   - `(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1)` is appended with `v1`.

3. **Determine the Next Tuple in the Reversed List**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `ops[::-1]`, the next tuple to be processed would be the second tuple from the original `ops` list.

4. **Update the State**:
   - `vx` remains an empty set as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `ops` still has at least one element, but now the first tuple has been processed, so the next tuple will be the second tuple in the original list.
   - `v1` and `v2` will now be the second tuple from the original `ops` list.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `vx` is still an empty set.
   - `ops` must have at least two elements.
   - `v1` and `v2` are the second tuple in the original `ops` list.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list that must have at least two elements, `v1` and `v2` are the second tuple in the list `ops`**.
