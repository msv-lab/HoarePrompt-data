Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), and an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The array a is considered beautiful. For each test case, the function determines and returns whether the array a meets certain criteria or computes a specific value based on the given conditions.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing a value for t, n, and an array a, and returns a result based on the beauty condition of the array a and other specified criteria.
