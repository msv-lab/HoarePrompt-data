Output: **Sasha**

Explanation: The print statement `print('Sasha')` directly prints the string 'Sasha'. None of the variables (`pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `i`, `resb`) are used in this print statement, so their values do not affect the output. The conditions and calculations involving these variables are only used to determine the value of `ress`, but they do not influence the direct output of the print statement.
