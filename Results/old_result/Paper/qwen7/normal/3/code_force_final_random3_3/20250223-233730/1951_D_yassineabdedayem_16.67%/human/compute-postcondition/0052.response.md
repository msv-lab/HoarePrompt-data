Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is the second element of `tab`.
- `tab` is the list of remaining elements from `tab`.

This implies that `i` is the second element of the list `tab`. When the `print(i, end=' ')` statement is executed, it will print the value of `i` followed by a space.

Output: **[second element of tab] **
