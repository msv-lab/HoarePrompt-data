Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Alice', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces, `clues[2]` is not even, `clues[4]` is not even, and `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`. Depending on the condition `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) > 1`, if the condition is true, `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'.
