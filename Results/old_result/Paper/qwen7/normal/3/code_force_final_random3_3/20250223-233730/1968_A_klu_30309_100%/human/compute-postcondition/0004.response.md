Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `y` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `y` starting from `x-1` down to `1` (since `y` cannot be 0 as per the range function).

3. **Determine the initial state of `y`**: Since the loop starts with `y = x-1`, `y` must be initialized to `x-1`.

4. **Check the range condition**: For the loop to execute, `x-1` must be greater than or equal to 1. This means `x` must be greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the given states**: We need to ensure that the initial value of `y` is set to `x-1` and that `x` is greater than 1.

Given the initial state:
- `max_sum` is 0
- `best_y` is 1

We need to adjust these states to satisfy the loop execution conditions.

**Final State**:
- `max_sum` is 0 (unchanged)
- `best_y` is 1 (unchanged)
- `x` must be greater than 1
- `y` must be initialized to `x-1`

So, the final state is:
State: **`max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` must be greater than 1, `y` is initialized to `x-1`**
