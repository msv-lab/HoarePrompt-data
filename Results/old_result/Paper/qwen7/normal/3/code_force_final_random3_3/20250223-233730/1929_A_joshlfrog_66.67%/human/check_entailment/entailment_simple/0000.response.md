Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as defined in the problem statement. The problem requires maximizing the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). However, the current implementation simply finds the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is not equivalent to the required sum of differences between consecutive elements.

To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after sorting. Sorting ensures that the largest and smallest values are appropriately placed to maximize the differences.

The given code does not perform this necessary sorting step. Instead, it finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and outputs their difference, which is not the correct approach.

Correctness: **False**
