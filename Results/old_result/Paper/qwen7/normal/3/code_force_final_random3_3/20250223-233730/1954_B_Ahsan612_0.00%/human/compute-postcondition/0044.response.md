Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of the list `ar`, `same` is the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`, `num` is the last number in the list `ar` that had the highest count of consecutive occurrences, and `minn` is the minimum value between `infinity` and the maximum `same` value found during the loop execution, and `minn` is updated to be the minimum of `minn` and `same`, and `minn` is not equal to infinity.
