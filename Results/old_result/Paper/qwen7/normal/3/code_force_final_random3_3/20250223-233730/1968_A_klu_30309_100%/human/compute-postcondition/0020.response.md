Postcondition: `max_sum` retains its original value, `best_y` retains its original value, `x` retains its original value, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y-1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (y - 1)`, `y` is `y - 1`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to `y - 1`. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.
