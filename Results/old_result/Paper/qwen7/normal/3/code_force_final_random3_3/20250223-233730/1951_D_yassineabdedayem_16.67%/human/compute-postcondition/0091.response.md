Output State: **`Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Max`, `k` is `k - Min`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `n` must be non-zero, `k` must be greater than zero, `rep` must be less than 60, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `k = k - Min` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `Min` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for the preconditions (`n` must be non-zero, `k` must be greater than zero, `rep` must be less than 60, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`) are still valid. The value of `Min` and `Max` are kept as they were in the initial state, and `number` remains equal to `Max`.
