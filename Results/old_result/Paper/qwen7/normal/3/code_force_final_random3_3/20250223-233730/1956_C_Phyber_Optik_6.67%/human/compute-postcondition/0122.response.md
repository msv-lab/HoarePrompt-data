Output State: **`j` is 2 * n + 2, `n` must still be at least 1, `r` is 3, `t` remains t - n * n, `sum` is updated to sum + 3 * n * i, `i` is an unspecified integer.**

Explanation: The code `sum += i * n` updates the variable `sum` by adding the product of `i` and `n` to its current value. Since `i` is not specified, it remains as an unspecified integer. All other variables (`j`, `n`, `r`, `t`, and `sum`) are either not affected or their conditions remain the same as the initial state.
