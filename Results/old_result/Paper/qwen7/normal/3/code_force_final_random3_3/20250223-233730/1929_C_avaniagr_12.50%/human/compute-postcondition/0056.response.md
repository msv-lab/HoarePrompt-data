Output State: `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\), `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 100\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `t` is now `t - 1`, `z` is 3, `i` is `x + 1`, `x` must be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 100\).

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `x + 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `x` inclusive, which means it runs `x + 1` times. The variable `z` increases by 1 in each iteration of the loop, so after `x + 1` iterations, `z` will be `x + 1`. Given that the output state after 3 iterations shows `z` as 3 when `x` is 2, we can generalize this to show that `z` will be `x + 1` after all iterations. All other variables (`k`, `a`, `t`, `x`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop body or head.
