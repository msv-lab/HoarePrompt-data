Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `j`, and it ranges from `1` to `n + 1`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - **Variable `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `j` should be `j + 1`.
   - **Variable `n`**: The value of `n` does not change within the loop. It remains the same as the initial value.
   - **Postcondition Considerations**: We need to ensure that the postconditions hold true for the next iteration. Specifically, we need to check if `j` is still within the range `[1, n]`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `nx` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted, and no new information about `nx` is provided.
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same.
- The condition `j` must be less than or equal to `n` must still hold.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`nx` is a string, `j` is incremented by 1 (so `j` becomes `j + 1`), `n` must be between 2 and 24, `xx[i][j]` is either not '?' or equals '?'. If `xx[i][j]` is not '?', `nx` is equal to the previous value of `nx` plus the value of `xx[i][j]`. If `xx[i][j]` is '?', then `nx` remains a string. If `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` ends with 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` ends with 'S'**.
