Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(paths)`, `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - len(paths) + 1)`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the first input string converted to integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the third input string converted to integer, `ps` is the fourth input string converted to integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. The other variables (`i`, `curr`, `pres`, `ress`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`) remain unchanged with their respective values from the initial state.
