Output State: **`done` is set to True, the current value of `count` is greater than 0, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and either `count2` is not greater than 0 or `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, and `(count2 != count)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement that checks the conditions specified. The conditions for `done`, `count`, `s[j]`, and `count2` remain unchanged except for the fact that we now know the loop or if statement has been exited.
