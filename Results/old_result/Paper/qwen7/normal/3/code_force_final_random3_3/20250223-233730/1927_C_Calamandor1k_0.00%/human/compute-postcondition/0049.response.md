Output State: **`t` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
