Output State: The loop will have executed \(n-1\) times, with `i` being \(n-2\). The variable `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\). For each iteration \(i\) from 0 to \(n-2\), two integers `u` and `v` are read from input. The nodes dictionary `nodes` is updated such that both `u` and `v` are appended to each other's lists. Therefore, after all iterations, `nodes[v]` will contain all nodes `u` that are connected to `v` through edges defined by the input.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `nodes` dictionary will represent the entire graph structure where each node points to all nodes it is directly connected to, forming an undirected graph.
