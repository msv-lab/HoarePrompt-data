Postcondition: **`l` is equal to `h`, `ans` holds the minimum value of `ans` updated during each iteration, considering the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` for the last valid `mid` value, `h` is equal to `l - 1`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` reflect the sums `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` for the last valid `mid` value, and `left` and `right` retain their values from the final iteration.**
