Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is 1
   - `u` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u ≤ n
   - `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5
   - `empty` is True
   - `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory list
   - `i` is 0
   - `nodes[v]` includes `u`

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0, it needs to be incremented to 1 for the next iteration.

Therefore, the only variable that needs to be updated is `i`.

5. **Adjust the other variables**:
   - `t`, `u`, `v`, `n`, `empty`, and `nodes` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is 1, `u` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u ≤ n, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory list, `i` is 1, `nodes[v]` includes `u`**.
