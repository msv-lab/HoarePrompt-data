Output State: `power` is 15, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 32768.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `power` by 1 until it is no longer less than \(\log_2(n)\). Given that `power` starts at 1 and increases by 1 each iteration, we can determine the final value of `power` by finding the smallest integer \(k\) such that \(2^{k-1} \geq n\). From the provided information, we know that after 3 iterations, `power` is 4 and `n` must be greater than 8. Continuing this pattern:

- After 4 iterations, `power` is 5 and `n` must be greater than 16.
- After 5 iterations, `power` is 6 and `n` must be greater than 32.
- ...
- After 14 iterations, `power` is 15 and `n` must be greater than 32768.

Since the loop will continue until `power` is no longer less than \(\log_2(n)\), if `n` is greater than 32768, `power` will reach 15 before the loop terminates. Therefore, the final state of `power` is 15, and the condition on `n` is that it must be greater than 32768.
