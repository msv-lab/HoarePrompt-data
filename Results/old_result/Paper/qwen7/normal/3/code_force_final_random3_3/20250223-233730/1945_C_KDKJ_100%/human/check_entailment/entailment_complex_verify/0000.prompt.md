You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In the village of Letovo, there are n houses. The villagers decided to build a
big road that will divide the village into left and right sides. Each resident
wants to live on either the right or the left side of the street, which is
described as a sequence a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n , where a_j = 0 if the resident
of the j -th house wants to live on the left side of the street; otherwise,
a_j = 1 .

The road will pass between two houses. The houses to the left of it will be
declared the left-side, and the houses to the right will be declared the
right-side. More formally, let the road pass between houses i and i+1 . Then
the houses at positions between 1 and i will be on the left side of the
street, and at positions between i+1 and n will be on the right side. The road
also may pass before the first and after the last house; in this case, the
entire village is declared to be either the right or left side, respectively.

To make the design fair, it was decided to lay the road so that at least half
of the residents on each side of the village are satisfied with the choice.
That is, among x residents on one side, at least \lceil\frac{x}{2}\rceil
should want to live on that side, where \lceil x \rceil denotes rounding up a
real number x .

To the left of the road, there will be i houses, among the corresponding a_j
there must be at least \lceil\frac{i}{2}\rceil zeros. To the right of the
road, there will be n-i houses, among the corresponding a_j there must be at
least \lceil\frac{n-i}{2}\rceil ones.

Determine after which house i the road should be laid in order to satisfy the
described condition and be as close to the middle of the village as possible.
Formally, among all suitable positions i , minimize \left|\frac{n}{2} -
i\right| .

If there are multiple suitable positions i with the minimum \left|\frac{n}{2}
- i\right| , output the smaller one.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ). The description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le
3\cdot 10^5 ). The next line of each test case contains a string a of length n
, consisting only of 0 and 1 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number i — the position of the house after
which the road should be laid (if it should be laid before the first house,
output 0 ). We can show that the answer always exists.

Note

Let's consider the first example of input data.

If we lay the road after the first house, there will be one house a_1 = 1 on
the left side of the street, the resident of which would like to live on the
right side of the street. Then 0 out of 1 residents on the even side will be
satisfied with the choice, which means that the road cannot be laid after
house 1 .

If we lay the road after the second house, 1 out of 2 residents on the left
side (with preferences a_1 = 1 , a_2 = 0 ) and 1 out of 1 resident on the
right side (with preference a_3 = 1 ) will be satisfied with the choice. More
than half of the residents on each side are satisfied with the choice, which
means that the road can be laid after house 2 . We can show that this is the
optimal answer.

    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `ans` will hold the value of `i` that satisfies the conditions within the loop and minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i`. The values of `left`, `lsum`, `right`, and `rsum` will be as defined in each iteration of the loop, but they will not affect the final value of `ans`. The other variables (`a`, `s`, `x`, `y`, and `S`) will retain their initial or unchanged states from the beginning of the loop.

    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the value of i that minimizes |n/2 - i| and satisfies left * 2 >= lsum and right * 2 >= rsum)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of houses, and `a`, a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. It calculates and prints the optimal position `i` such that the number of residents preferring to live on the left side up to position `i` is at least half of those up to `i`, and the number of residents preferring to live on the right side from position `i` to the end is also at least half of those from `i` to the end. If no such position exists, it prints -1.

        func_1()
        
    #State: Output State: `func_1()` has already been called three times.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs for a number of iterations specified by the user input. Based on the provided output states, each iteration of the loop calls `func_1()`. After the loop executes 3 times, `func_1()` has been called twice. Therefore, if the loop were to run to completion, `func_1()` would be called as many times as the loop iterates. Since no further information about the changes inside `func_1()` or any other variables outside the loop is given, we can conclude that `func_1()` will be called one more time if the loop completes all its iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything. It reads an integer from user input, which specifies the number of times to call `func_1()`. After reading the input, it calls `func_1()` exactly three times. The final state of the program is that `func_1()` has been called three times.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program uses a different approach to calculate the number of zeros and ones on either side of the road, which does not align with the problem description.

The problem requires checking whether at least \(\lceil \frac{i}{2} \rceil\) zeros are on the left side and \(\lceil \frac{n-i}{2} \rceil\) ones are on the right side for each possible position \(i\). However, the program calculates the cumulative counts of zeros and ones without properly checking these conditions.

Here is an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
3
101
```

The program should output `2` because:
- If the road is placed after the first house, there is 1 zero on the left side, but \(\lceil \frac{1}{2} \rceil = 1\), so it satisfies the condition.
- If the road is placed after the second house, there is 1 zero on the left side and 1 one on the right side, both satisfying \(\lceil \frac{2}{2} \rceil = 1\) and \(\lceil \frac{1}{2} \rceil = 1\).
- If the road is placed after the third house, there are 2 zeros on the left side, but \(\lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2\), so it satisfies the condition.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the cumulative counts and does not properly check the conditions. For the input `101`, the program outputs `2`, which is correct, but for other inputs, it might fail to correctly identify the optimal position.

A corrected version of the program would involve directly checking the conditions for each position \(i\) as described in the problem statement.
