Postcondition: `card` is no longer used, `rank` is the rank part of the original `card`, `suit` is the suit part of the original `card`, `trumps` is unchanged, and `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`. Additionally, `answers` now contains one more element. If `suits[suit]` was `None`, then `answers` contains a string formed by joining `None` and `rank` with a space in between. Otherwise, `suits[suit]` remains `rank` and `answers` contains the updated `rank`.
