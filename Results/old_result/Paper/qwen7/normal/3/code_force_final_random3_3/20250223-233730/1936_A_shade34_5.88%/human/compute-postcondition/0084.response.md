Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(int(input())):` statement.
   - This means the loop will run based on the input provided by the user.
   - The variable `_` (a common placeholder for an unused variable) is used as the loop counter.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `mak` is 3

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `int(input())` provides a positive integer value.
   - Since `_` is a placeholder, it does not directly affect the loop continuation; instead, the loop continues based on the user input.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the user must provide a positive integer as input.
   - The values of `i` and `mak` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the loop can potentially execute again if the user inputs a positive integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `mak` is 3, the user must provide a positive integer as input for the loop to execute again**
