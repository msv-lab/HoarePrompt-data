Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `tmp` has some value, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` retains its value from the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `tmp`, `a`, `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
