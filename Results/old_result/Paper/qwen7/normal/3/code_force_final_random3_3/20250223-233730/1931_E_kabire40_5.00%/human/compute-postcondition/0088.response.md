Postcondition: `x` is an integer, `rev_res` is a string, and `val_in` is a string. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the concatenation of `rev_res` and the string representation of `val_in`. If `x` is odd, `rev_val` is modified such that `val_in` is assigned the value of `rev_val[x]`, and `rev_res` is the concatenation of `val_in` reversed.
