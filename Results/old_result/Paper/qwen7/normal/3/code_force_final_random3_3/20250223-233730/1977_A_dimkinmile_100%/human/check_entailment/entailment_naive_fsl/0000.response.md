Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is less than `m`. According to the problem description, Nikita can only add or remove exactly one cube per move. Therefore, the difference between `n` and `m` must be even and non-negative for it to be possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. However, the current implementation checks only if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`, which is not sufficient.

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `m = 4`. Here, `n - m = -2`, which is not greater than or equal to 0, but it is still impossible to achieve 4 cubes after 2 moves because the maximum number of cubes that can be added is 2. The program would incorrectly output "Yes" for this case.

To fix this, the condition should check if `abs(n - m)` is even and non-negative. Here is the corrected version:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if abs(n - m) % 2 == 0 and abs(n - m) >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This ensures that the program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
