Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the game logic. Here’s why:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is used to transform the list of pile sizes but it doesn't align with the game rules. It sorts and modifies the list in a way that doesn’t reflect the game dynamics.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function is supposed to determine the winner based on the transformed list, but it has several issues:
   - It incorrectly handles the base cases.
   - The recursive logic does not correctly simulate the game state transitions.
   - The function does not use the transformed list (`a_new`) from `func_1`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to understand the Nim Game strategy. In the Nim Game, if the XOR of all pile sizes is zero, the second player wins; otherwise, the first player wins.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def nim_game_winner(n, piles):
    # Calculate the XOR of all pile sizes
    xor_sum = 0
    for pile in piles:
        xor_sum ^= pile
    
    # Determine the winner based on the XOR result
    if xor_sum == 0:
        return "Bob"
    else:
        return "Alice"

# Read input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    piles = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Output the winner
    print(nim_game_winner(n, piles))
```

This solution correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the XOR of the pile sizes.
