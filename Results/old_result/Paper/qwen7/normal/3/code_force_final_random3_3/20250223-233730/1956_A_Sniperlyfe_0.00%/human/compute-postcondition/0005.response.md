Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `res` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `res`. No changes are made to the values of `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, or `qs`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
