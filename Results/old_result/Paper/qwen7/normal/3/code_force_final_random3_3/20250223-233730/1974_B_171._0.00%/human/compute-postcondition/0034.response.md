Output State: **`c` must be within the range 98 to 124 (inclusive), `char` is the next character in `encoded`, and `decoded` remains unchanged unless `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`; `mapping[chr(c)]` is now equal to `char`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `char` to the key `chr(c)` in the dictionary `mapping`. The values of `c`, `char`, and `decoded` remain unchanged unless `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, in which case `decoded` would remain unchanged. Since no specific values are given for `c` and `char`, we keep their conditions as they are.
