Output State: `j` is `2 * n + 2`, `n` must be at least 1, `r` is either `i` or 3 depending on the previous values of `i`, `t` remains `t - n * n`, and `sum` is updated to `sum + 3 * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, which happens for all iterations since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`. Therefore, `sum` will be the sum of `3 * n` for each iteration plus `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration, resulting in a final `sum` value of `3 * n * n + n * (n + 1) // 2`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `j` will remain as `2 * n + 2`, `n` will still be at least 1, `r` could be `i` or 3, `t` will be reduced by `n * n` for each iteration, and `sum` will be the total of `3 * n * n` plus `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all iterations.
