Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `tmp` has some value, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `tmp`, `a`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes `cnt` being increased by 1, while all other variables retain their original conditions and values.
