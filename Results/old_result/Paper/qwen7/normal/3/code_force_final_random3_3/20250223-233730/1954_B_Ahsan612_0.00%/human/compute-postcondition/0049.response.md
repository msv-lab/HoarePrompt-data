Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is equal to the length of the list `ar`.
- `same` is the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`.
- `num` is the last number in the list `ar` that had the highest count of consecutive occurrences.
- `minn` is the minimum value between `infinity` and the maximum `same` value found during the loop execution, and `minn` is updated to be the minimum of `minn` and `same`.

### Loop Head
The loop head is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `_` is an underscore, which is typically used to indicate that the variable is not being used within the loop body. This means that the loop does not depend on any specific variable for its continuation.
- The loop itself is controlled by the input, which determines the number of iterations.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Input**: The loop will run for the number of times specified by the user input.
2. **No Change in Variables**: Since the loop does not depend on any specific variables (like `i`, `same`, `num`, or `minn`) from the loop body, these variables remain unchanged.
3. **State Adjustment**: The only thing that changes is the number of iterations left. Since the loop is controlled by the input, the state remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final State
Since the loop is controlled by the user input and does not depend on any specific variables from the loop body, the state remains the same.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is equal to the length of the list `ar`, `same` is the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`, `num` is the last number in the list `ar` that had the highest count of consecutive occurrences, and `minn` is the minimum value between `infinity` and the maximum `same` value found during the loop execution, and `minn` is updated to be the minimum of `minn` and `same`**.
