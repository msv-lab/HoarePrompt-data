Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `n` and `qs`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `qs`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `q` is an input integer.
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers (with the first element removed).
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended with the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `n` is the second element in `qs`.

4. **Determine the next value of `n`**: Since `n` is taken from `qs` and the loop continues until `qs` is empty, the next value of `n` will be the third element in `qs`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `t`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.
   - `p` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `qs` will now have one less element since `n` was taken from it.
   - `res` remains unchanged because it is not directly affected by the loop head.
   - `n` will be updated to the third element in `qs`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers (with the first two elements removed), `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended with the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `n` is the third element in `qs`**
