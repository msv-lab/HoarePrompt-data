The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4), a positive integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 3⋅10^5), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers (0 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ \( n \)). For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific result based on the distribution of values in the list \( a \). If \( n \) is less than 3, it prints 0. Otherwise, it computes a value related to the combinatorial arrangements of elements in \( a \) and prints this value. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
