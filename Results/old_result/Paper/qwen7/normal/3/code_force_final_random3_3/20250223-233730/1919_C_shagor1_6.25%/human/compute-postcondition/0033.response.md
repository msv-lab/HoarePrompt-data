Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `inp` is a non-empty tuple containing integers from the input split by spaces, `x` is \(n + 1\), `y` is the next element in `inp` (after `a`), `ans` is 1 if the third element in `inp` is less than or equal to `x`, 2 if the third element in `inp` is less than or equal to `x`, and 0 otherwise, and `a` is the next element in `inp`, and `x` is equal to `y`.**

Explanation: The line `y = a` assigns the value of `a` to `y`. Since `a` is the next element in `inp` (after `a`), `y` now holds this value. The values of `t`, `n`, `inp`, `x`, `ans`, and `a` remain unchanged from their previous states.
