Postcondition: `j` is `count`, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first element of the list `s`, `count` is greater than 0, `done` is `False`, `count2` is either `count` (if `s[j]` equals `x`), or it remains as the last calculated value, `i` is 1, `t` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, and the condition `(not done)` remains true if `x` is not equal to the last element of the list `s`. If `s.count(x) == n`, then `done` becomes `True`.
