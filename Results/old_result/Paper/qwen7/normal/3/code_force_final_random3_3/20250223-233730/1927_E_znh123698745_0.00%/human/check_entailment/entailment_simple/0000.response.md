Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a \(k\)-level permutation of length \(n\) where \(k\) is even.
2. A \(k\)-level permutation ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of continuous segments of length \(k\) is at most 1.
3. The provided code constructs a permutation by alternating between decrementing and incrementing indices of the array `array` which contains numbers from 1 to \(n\).
4. Let's analyze the logic of the code:
   - It initializes `answer` with the first element `1`.
   - It uses a list `a` initialized with `[1, -1]` to keep track of the starting index for the next element to be added to `answer`.
   - For each subsequent element, it alternates between using the current value of `a[0]` and `a[-1]` to select the next element from `array`.
   - It updates `a[0]` and `a[-1]` based on the parity of the current index `i`.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting permutation will satisfy the \(k\)-level condition. Specifically, the code does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length \(k\) will have a difference of at most 1.

To illustrate, consider a small example:
- For \(n = 4\) and \(k = 2\), the code might produce `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The sums would be `[3, 5]`, which do not meet the \(k\)-level condition since \(|5 - 3| = 2 > 1\).

Therefore, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
