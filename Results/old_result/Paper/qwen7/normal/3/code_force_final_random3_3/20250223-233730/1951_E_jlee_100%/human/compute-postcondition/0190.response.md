Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is False, `count` is 1, `count2` is 2, `i` is 1, `t` is 1.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the variables remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables listed in the initial state.
