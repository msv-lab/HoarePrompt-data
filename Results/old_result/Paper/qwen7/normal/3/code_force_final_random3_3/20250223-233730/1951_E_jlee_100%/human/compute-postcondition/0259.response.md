Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is assigned the value of `count`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `x` is a character.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- The character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`.
- The character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to `x`.
- The current value of `count2` is greater than the current value of `count`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables and objects mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
