Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - The loop starts with `i` being 0 (since `range(n - 1)` generates values from 0 to `n-2`).
   - The value of `n` remains as given in the initial state.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop will increment `i` in each iteration, the loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - Given that `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5`, `n - 1` will always be positive, ensuring the loop will execute.

4. **Other variables**:
   - `t`, `u`, `v`, `empty`, and `nodes` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only variables that need adjustment are `i` and `n`.

State: **`t` is 1, `u` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u ≤ n, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory list, `i` is 0**
