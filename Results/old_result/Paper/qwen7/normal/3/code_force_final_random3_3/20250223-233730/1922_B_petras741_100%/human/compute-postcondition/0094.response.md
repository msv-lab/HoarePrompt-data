Output State: **`rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from `range(n + 1)` for which `q[j] > 0`, and `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. The length of `eta` is not equal to 1; `res` is `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`**.

This means that the variable `res` has been calculated as the product of `q[eta[0]]`, `q[eta[0]] - 1`, and `q[eta[0]] - 2` divided by 6. All other variables retain their initial conditions, with `rho` being equal to `q[eta[0]]`, `eta` being a list of indices where `q[j] > 0`, and `eta_ln` representing the length of `eta`, which is not equal to 1.
