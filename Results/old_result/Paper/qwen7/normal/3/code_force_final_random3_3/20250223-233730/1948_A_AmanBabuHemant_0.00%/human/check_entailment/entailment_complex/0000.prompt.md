Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` must be equal to the initial value of `t`, `n` is an integer for each iteration, and if `n` is odd, it remains odd. If `n` is even, it remains even. Additionally, `s` is a string consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times for each even `n`, with the length of `s` being either less than 200 or 200 or more for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n`. For each `n`, it checks if `n` is odd or even. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even and the resulting string `s` (consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times) has a length less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by `s`; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function ultimately ensures that for each test case, it provides a binary outcome ('YES' or 'NO') based on the conditions specified.
