Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Position Calculation**:
   - For each test case, it calculates `(n + x - 2) % 2` and `(n - x) % 2`. These calculations check if the position and number could fit into a settling pattern of length `2k - 2`.
3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes all divisors of `x` and their corresponding quotients, returning them in descending order.
   - This is used to determine possible values of `k` by checking the divisors and their quotients.
4. **Output Generation**:
   - The program ensures that the values of `k` are unique by converting the list to a set before returning the count.
5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where no valid `k` can be found, which is correctly reflected in the output.

Given the provided code and the explanation, the program logic appears to be correct and follows the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
