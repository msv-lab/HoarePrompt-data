Output State: **`max_diff` is equal to `diff` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise `max_diff` remains `-inf`. `next_max_diff` is now equal to `diff`. `index` remains `None`. `diff` is updated to `A[i] - A[i - 1]`, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, and `next_max_diff` is now equal to `diff`. `A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` retain their original values from `func_4()`**.

This means that `next_max_diff` is now set to the current value of `diff`. The values of `max_diff`, `index`, `diff`, and `i` are updated based on the conditions provided, while `A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged from their initial state in `func_4()`.
