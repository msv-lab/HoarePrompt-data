Based on the initial state provided:

- `count` is 2
- `k` is 1
- `n` is greater than `j`

The condition for incrementing `count` is met because:
- The character at index `k` in string `s` is `'?'`
- The character at index `k + j` in string `s` is also `'?'`

Since both conditions are true, `count` remains 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print(count * 2)
```

Given that `count` is 2, `count * 2` evaluates to 4.

Output: **4**
