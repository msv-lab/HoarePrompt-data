Output State: **`mini` is equal to `arr[0]`, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `n` must be at least 4, `res` is an input string, and `arr` will contain a list of integers starting from the smallest index `i_prev` up to `n-1`.**

Explanation: The line `mini = arr[0]` assigns the first element of the list `arr` to the variable `mini`. The values of `i`, `n`, `res`, and the list `arr` remain unchanged from their initial state.
