Postcondition: `s` is a string, `j` is an index within the string such that `j + 1` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, `done` is set to `True`, `count` is equal to `j`, `s[j + 1]` remains not equal to `x`, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to `True`, `count` is equal to `j`, `s[j + 1]` remains not equal to `x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is not greater than `count`, no changes are made to the variables.
