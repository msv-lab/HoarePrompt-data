Output State: **`done` remains `False`, `i` is incremented by 1 (new value is `i_new`), `j` is the next value in the sequence (either 0 or 1), `count` is equal to `j`, `count2` is 0, `s` is a list representation of the string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first element of the list `s`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the `continue` statement itself, the values of all the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
