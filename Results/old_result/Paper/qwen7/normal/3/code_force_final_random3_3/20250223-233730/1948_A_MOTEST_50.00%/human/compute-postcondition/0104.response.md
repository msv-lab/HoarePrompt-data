Postcondition: **`t` must be less than `n // 2`, `i` is `t + n // 2`, `n` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 11, `ans` is increased by `2 * s[x]` for each of the `n // 2 - 1` iterations, `x` is increased by 1 after each iteration, and `j` is `n // 2 - 1`.**

Explanation: After the if-else block executes, `t` remains unchanged and must be less than `n // 2`. The variable `i` becomes `t + n // 2` because `i` starts at `t` and increments by 1 in each iteration. `n` remains an odd integer greater than or equal to 11. The string `ans` is incremented by `2 * s[x]` for each of the `n // 2 - 1` iterations, and `x` is increased by 1 after each iteration, starting from `t` and ending at `t + n // 2 - 1`. The variable `j` reaches `n // 2 - 1` after the loop completes, as the loop runs from `0` to `n // 2 - 2` inclusive.
