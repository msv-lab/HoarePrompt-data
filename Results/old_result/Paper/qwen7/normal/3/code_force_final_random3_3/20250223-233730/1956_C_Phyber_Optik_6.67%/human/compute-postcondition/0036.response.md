Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `j` is known.
- `n` is known.
- `r` is known.
- `sum` is 0 if `j` is greater than `n`; otherwise, it is unknown but follows the condition that if `j` is less than or equal to `n`, `sum` remains 0.

### Loop Condition:
The loop runs for `j` in the range from 1 to `n + r`.

### Current State Analysis:
- The loop starts with `j = 1`.
- If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop continues.
- If `j` is greater than `n`, the loop stops.

### Loop Head Variables:
- `j`: The variable being iterated over.
- `n`: The upper limit of the loop.
- `r`: A constant added to `n` to determine the upper limit of the loop.
- `sum`: Accumulates some value within the loop (though not explicitly mentioned in the problem).

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Initial Values**: At the start of the loop, `j` is 1.
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop continues.
   - If `j` is greater than `n`, the loop stops.

Given that the loop continues until `j` is less than or equal to `n + r`, let's consider the possible scenarios:

- If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop continues.
- If `j` is greater than `n + r`, the loop stops.

Since the loop is iterating from 1 to `n + r`, the next value of `j` would be `j + 1`.

### Adjusting the States:
- `j` will be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `r` remains unchanged.
- `sum` remains 0 if `j` is still less than or equal to `n`.

If `j` is currently less than or equal to `n`, after one iteration, `j` will become `j + 1`.

### Final State:
- `j` will be `j + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `r` remains the same.
- `sum` remains 0 if `j` is still less than or equal to `n`.

### Conclusion:
If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop will continue, and `j` will be incremented by 1. Otherwise, the loop will stop.

State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `n` is known, `r` is known, and `sum` is 0 if `j` is still less than or equal to `n`**.
