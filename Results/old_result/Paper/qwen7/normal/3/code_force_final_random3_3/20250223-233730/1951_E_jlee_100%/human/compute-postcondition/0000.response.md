Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters such that 1 ≤ |`s`| ≤ 10^6. Additionally, the sum of |`s`| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6; `t` is now assigned the value of `int(input())`.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 remains valid, and now `t` is specifically set to the value entered by the user. The variable `s` remains unchanged, as no operation involving `s` was performed.
