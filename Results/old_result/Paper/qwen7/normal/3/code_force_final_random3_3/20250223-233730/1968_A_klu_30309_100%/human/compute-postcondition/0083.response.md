Output State: **`max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 2`, the `results` list now contains 1, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 3)`, `x` is the next value from `test_cases`, `y` is `x - 3`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y**.

Explanation: The line `max_sum = current_sum` updates the value of `max_sum` to the current value of `current_sum`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
