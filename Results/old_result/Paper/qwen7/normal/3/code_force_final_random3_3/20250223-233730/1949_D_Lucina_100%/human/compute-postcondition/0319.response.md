Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `nx` is the character at `xx[1][0]`, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**.

The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at `xx[i][j - 1]` (which is `xx[1][0]`) to the string `nx`. All other variables remain unchanged.
