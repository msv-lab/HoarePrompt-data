Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is `n - 1` and `j` is `1`.
   - If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then `n` becomes `n - 2`.
   - The condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement is checked, and if either `c` is `False` or `j` equals `n`, the loop or if statement is exited.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `1` to `n + 1`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - We need to determine the new value of `j` for the next iteration.
   - Since the loop starts from `1` and increments `j` by `1` each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `2`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration unless `cntl[j]` is less than 2, which would cause `n` to become `n - 2`.

Given that `j` is `1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `j` will be `2`. Therefore, we need to check if `cntl[2]` is less than 2 to determine if `n` should be updated.

- If `cntl[2]` is less than 2, then `n` becomes `n - 2`.
- Otherwise, `n` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration (`n - 1`).

Since we don't have the exact value of `n` or `cntl[2]`, we'll assume the general case where `n` remains `n - 1` unless `cntl[2]` is less than 2.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `j` is `2`.
- `n` is `n - 1` unless `cntl[2]` is less than 2, in which case `n` is `n - 3`.

However, since we need to provide a specific state without knowing the exact value of `cntl[2]`, we'll consider the general case where `n` remains `n - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is `n - 1`, `j` is `2`**
