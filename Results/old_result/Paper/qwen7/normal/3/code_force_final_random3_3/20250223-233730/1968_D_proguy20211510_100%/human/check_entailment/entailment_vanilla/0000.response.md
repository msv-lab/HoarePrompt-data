Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - It reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` for each test case.
   - It reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Path Calculation for Bodya:**
   - The program initializes a list `pathb` to store the scores Bodya would accumulate.
   - It uses a `vis` array to keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.
   - It simulates Bodya's moves and calculates the total score for each possible path until a cycle is detected.

3. **Path Calculation for Sasha:**
   - Similarly, it initializes a list `paths` to store the scores Sasha would accumulate.
   - It uses a `vis` array to keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.
   - It simulates Sasha's moves and calculates the total score for each possible path until a cycle is detected.

4. **Score Calculation:**
   - For Bodya, it calculates the maximum possible score `resb` by considering the accumulated scores up to `k` turns.
   - For Sasha, it calculates the maximum possible score `ress` by considering the accumulated scores up to `k` turns.

5. **Result Determination:**
   - It compares the scores `resb` and `ress` and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

### Potential Issues

1. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program assumes that the path will eventually form a cycle due to the constraints (`1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9`). However, the problem guarantees that the permutation is valid, so cycles should not occur unless the input is invalid. This assumption is generally safe given the constraints.

2. **Score Calculation Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the maximum possible score seems correct. It accumulates scores up to `k` turns and considers the best possible path.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is less than the length of the path, which is correctly handled by breaking out of the loop early.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the provided problem description. There are no apparent logical errors or issues with the implementation.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
