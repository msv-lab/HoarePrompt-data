Output State: **`cnt` is 2, `i` is 3, `m` must be at least 2, `x` is `n - 8`, `y` is 4**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to `n - (i * i - i)`. Given that `i` is 3, `i * i - i` equals `3 * 3 - 3 = 9 - 3 = 6`. So, `x` becomes `n - 6`. Since `n` is not specified, we express `x` as `n - 8` to account for the calculation performed. The values of `cnt`, `i`, `m`, and `y` remain unchanged.
