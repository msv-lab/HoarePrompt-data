Output State: **`minn` is the minimum value between the initial value of `minn` (either 1 or the minimum value found in the list `ar` starting from index 1) and `same`; `same` is the total number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in the list `ar`, `num` is the last element of the list `ar` that was checked (which will be different from the first element if there was a change), and `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.**

In this state, `minn` is updated to be the minimum value between its initial value and `same`. The value of `same` remains unchanged, reflecting the longest sequence of consecutive occurrences of the first element encountered. The value of `num` remains the last element of the list that was checked, and `i` is set to the length of the list `ar`, indicating that all elements have been processed.
