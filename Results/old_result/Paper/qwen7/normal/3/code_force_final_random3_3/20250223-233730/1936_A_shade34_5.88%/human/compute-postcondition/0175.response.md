Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to the length of `pans`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `1` to `n-1` (inclusive).

4. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be in the range `1` to `n-1`.
   - This means `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to the length of `pans`, and `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n`.
   - We don't need to change the value of `n` because it is an input integer and its value is already known.
   - We also need to ensure that `i` is at least 1, as the loop starts from 1.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` must be less than `n` and at least 1.
- `n` remains as an input integer.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is less than `n` and at least 1, `n` is an input integer**.
