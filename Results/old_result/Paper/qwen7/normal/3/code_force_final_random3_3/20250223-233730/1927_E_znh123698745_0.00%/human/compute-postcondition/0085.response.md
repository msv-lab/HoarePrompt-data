Output State: **`k` is the input value of `k` decremented by 1, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `array` is a list containing numbers from 1 to `n`, `answer` is a list containing the numbers 1 and 2 followed by the element at index `-1` of list `a`, `a` is a list containing either [2, -2] or [3, -1] depending on the condition `-1**.

This means that the `answer` list has had its last element appended with the value at the index `-1` of the list `a`. Since `a` can either be `[2, -2]` or `[3, -1]`, the value appended to `answer` will be `-2` or `-1` respectively. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
