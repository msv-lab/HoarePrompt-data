Postcondition: **`k` is equal to the length of the list `primes`, and 1 is yielded. If `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`, then all prime factors in the `factors` dictionary have been processed, meaning their corresponding values are all set to -1. For each prime factor `prime` that appeared in the `factors` dictionary, `prime_to_i` will hold the product of `prime` raised to the power of its original count in `factors`. Additionally, the loop will have yielded a sequence of values, each being the product of a `factor` from `rest` and the final value of `prime_to_i` for each prime factor processed.**
