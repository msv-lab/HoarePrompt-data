State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` must be 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(t):` will execute if `t` is a positive integer and greater than 0.
2. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the beginning of the loop.
3. Since `t` is given as an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\), we need to ensure that `t` is within this range for the loop to execute.
4. The initial value of `i` is set to 0 before entering the loop, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `t` is within the specified range and `i` is initialized to 0.
