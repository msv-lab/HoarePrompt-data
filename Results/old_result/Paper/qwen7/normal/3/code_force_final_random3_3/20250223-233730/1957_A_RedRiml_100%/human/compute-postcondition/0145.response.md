Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `pl`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `pl` has at least one element.
   - The current value of `d[j]` must be greater than or equal to 3.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`.
   - `pl` must have at least one element.
   - The current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues if `pl` has at least one element, for the loop to execute again, `pl` must still have at least one element.
   - The value of `d[j]` is used in the loop, but it does not change within the loop itself (it is only checked). Therefore, the value of `d[j]` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The value of `shapes` is updated based on the current value of `d[j]`, but since we are only concerned with the initial state for the next iteration, we do not need to adjust `shapes`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `shapes` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `pl` must still have at least one element.
   - The current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`, `pl` must have at least one element, and the current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3**.
