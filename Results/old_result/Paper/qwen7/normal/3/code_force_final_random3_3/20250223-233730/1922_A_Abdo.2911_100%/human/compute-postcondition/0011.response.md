Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, and the value of `a[0]` is equal to the value of `b[0]`. The current value of `c[0]` is not equal to the value of `a[0]`. `possible` is True.**

Explanation: The line `possible = True` sets the variable `possible` to `True`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `a[0]`, `b[0]`, and `c[0]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
