Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values from the input.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is updated by adding the sum of `a` and the integer division of `(b + c)` by 3 to its current value. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the input, their specific values are used in the calculation. The other variables remain unchanged.
