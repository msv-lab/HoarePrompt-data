Output State: **`k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1 - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1 - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] + sp + 2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp + a[b]`, `i` is `i_prev + 3`**

Explanation: 
- The variable `k` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `-1` to `-2`.
- The values of `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the operation `k -= 1`.
