Postcondition: `arr` contains all elements except the current `a`, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`, `count` is incremented by `freq[(a % x, a % y)]`, and `freq[current_pair]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether `current_pair` was already present in `freq`.
