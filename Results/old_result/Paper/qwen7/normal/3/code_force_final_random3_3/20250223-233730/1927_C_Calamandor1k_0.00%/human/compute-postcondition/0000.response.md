Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and now `t` is set to the integer input received.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since `t` was initially described as a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, the input must still fall within this range. After executing the code, `t` now holds the specific integer value input by the user.
