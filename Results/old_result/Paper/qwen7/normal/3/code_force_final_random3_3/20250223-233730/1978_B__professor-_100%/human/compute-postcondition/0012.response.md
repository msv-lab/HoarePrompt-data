Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer. If the current value of `b` is less than or equal to `a`, no change is made to `b`. Otherwise, if the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, then `b` is set to be less than or equal to `a`.
