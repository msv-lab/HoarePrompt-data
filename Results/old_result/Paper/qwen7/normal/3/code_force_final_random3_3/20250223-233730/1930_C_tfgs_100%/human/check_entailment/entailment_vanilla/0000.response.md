Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input and Setting Up the Initial Conditions:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array `a` and the array `a` itself.
   
2. **Modifying Array Elements:**
   - It modifies each element `a[i]` by adding `i + 1`, effectively performing the operation `a_i + i`.

3. **Using a Counter and Set:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each modified value.
   - It converts the list to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order.

4. **Constructing the Result Array `b`:**
   - It iterates through the sorted list and constructs the result array `ans` by ensuring the maximum possible values are placed first.
   - It handles the case where there are remaining elements to add to the result array by appending the last value minus one for the required number of times.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - Finally, it prints the constructed array `ans`.

### Detailed Verification:

1. **Modification of Array Elements:**
   - The modification `a[i] += i + 1` is correctly implemented and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - Using a `set` to remove duplicates ensures that each value in the set is unique, as required by the problem statement.

3. **Sorting and Constructing `b`:**
   - Sorting the set in descending order and constructing the result array `ans` in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order is correct. The logic for handling remaining elements and ensuring the maximum values are placed first is sound.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as when there are remaining elements to add to the result array by appending the last value minus one for the required number of times.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It processes the input, modifies the array elements, removes duplicates, sorts them, and constructs the lexicographically largest array `b` as required.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
