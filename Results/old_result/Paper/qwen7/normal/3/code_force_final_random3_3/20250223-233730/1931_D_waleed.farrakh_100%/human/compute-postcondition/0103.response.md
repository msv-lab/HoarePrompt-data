Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `current_pair` is `((-a % x + x) % x, a % y)`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`.**

Explanation: The code updates the first element of the `current_pair` tuple to `(-a % x + x) % x`. This calculation ensures that the result is always non-negative and within the range of 0 to x-1. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
