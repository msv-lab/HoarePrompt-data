The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, but since it is a dummy variable (often used as a placeholder when the variable itself is not needed within the loop), it does not affect the loop's execution conditions. The loop's continuation depends on the value of `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is `t-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
