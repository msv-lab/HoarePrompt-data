Output State: **`tmp` now has one fewer element, `i` is either the first element of the new `tmp` or has been removed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not affect the values of `tmp` or `i`. It only indicates that we are breaking out of the loop or conditional block we are currently inside. The precondition that `tmp` must not be empty and `i` is either the first element of `tmp` or has been removed and `tmp` now has one fewer element remains valid after the execution of the `break` statement.
