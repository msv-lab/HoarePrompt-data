Output State: **`q` is a perfect square, `w` is an integer greater than 0, and there exists an integer `i` such that `q % i == 0` and `i` is `i + 1`. `M` is a list containing the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `M`. Since `i` is such that `q % i == 0` and `i` is `i + 1`, the only integer that satisfies `i` being `i + 1` is `i = 0`. However, since `q` is a perfect square and there exists an integer `i` such that `q % i == 0` and `i` is `i + 1`, `i` cannot be `0` because `0` does not satisfy the condition `q % i == 0` for a non-zero perfect square `q`. Therefore, the value of `i` must be a non-zero integer that divides `q` and satisfies the given condition. The value of `M` is updated to include this integer `i`.
