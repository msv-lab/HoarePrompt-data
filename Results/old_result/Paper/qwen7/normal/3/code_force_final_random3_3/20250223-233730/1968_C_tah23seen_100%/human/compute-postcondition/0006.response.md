Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is 10^9 except for `ans[i]` which is `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` for all 0 <= i < n-1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. This means that starting from the second last element of the `ans` list (index `n-2`), each element is updated based on the formula given. However, since the initial state of `ans` is such that all elements are `10^9` except for `ans[i]` which is `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, the first part of the list remains unchanged. The only change occurs for the elements starting from index `0` to `n-2`. Therefore, the output state maintains the initial conditions of `arr` and `ans` with the updated values of `ans` as per the given formula.
