Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Alice', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces, `clues[2]` is not even, `clues[4]` is not even, `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, and `clues[3]` is less than or equal to `clues[5]`. Additionally, the decision for whether `answers` contains 'Draw' or 'Alice' is based on the condition that either `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of `(clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2` or `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of `(clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2`. If neither of these conditions is met, `answers` will contain 'Alice'.
