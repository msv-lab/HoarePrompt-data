Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive), `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing the first element of `vx` and an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to at least 2, `ops` is a list containing either one tuple `(v1, v2)` or two tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, `p1` is a list containing the first element of the updated `vx` and an empty list, `v1` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 2`, `v2` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 2`, and `v2` is greater than 0 unless the else part is executed, in which case `v2` is less than or equal to 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to at least 1, `ops` is a list containing either one tuple `(v1, v2)` or two tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` plus an additional tuple `(v1, v2)` or three tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0), (v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, `p1` is a list containing the first element of the updated `vx` and an empty list, `v1` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 1`, `v2` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 1` and is greater than 0 unless the else part is executed, in which case `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the result of `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx` if the else part is executed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to at least 0, `ops` is a list containing either one tuple `(v1, v2)`, two tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` plus an additional tuple `(v1, v2)`, or three tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0), (v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` plus an additional tuple `(v1, v2)`, `p1` is a list containing the first element of the updated `vx` and an empty list, `v1` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 2`, `v2` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 2` and is greater than 0 unless the else part is executed, in which case `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the result of `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx` if the else part is executed, and `len(vx)` is now `len(vx) - 1`. If `v2 > 0`, `v3` remains in `vx`; otherwise, `v3` is no longer in `vx`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
