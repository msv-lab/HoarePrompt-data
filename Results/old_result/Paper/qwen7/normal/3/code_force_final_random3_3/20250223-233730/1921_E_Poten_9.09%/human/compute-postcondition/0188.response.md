Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', 'Draw', and 'Bob', `i` is 4, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code appends 'Bob' to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` contains either 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice'. After appending 'Bob', `answers` now contains 'Alice', 'Draw', and 'Bob'. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 (from 3 to 4) because the code is part of a loop or sequence where `i` is updated after each iteration. The initial conditions for `test_cases` and `clues` remain unchanged.
