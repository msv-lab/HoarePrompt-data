Postcondition: **`t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, and `res` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the middle element (`a[mdx]`) from the middle index towards the end of the list `a`. `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and `i` is the last index value that was checked in the loop.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after executing the if-else block. If `n == 1`, the postcondition directly reflects the state without further operations. Otherwise, the postcondition captures the result of the loop execution where `res` counts the consecutive occurrences of the middle element in the list `a`, with `t` decremented by the number of iterations, `n` remaining unchanged, `a` staying as the sorted list of integers, `mdx` being the adjusted middle index, and `i` being the last index checked.
