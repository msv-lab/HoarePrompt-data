Output State: **`c` is increased by 1, `ans` is the integer value of `ans` divided by `arr[l]` modulo `MOD`, `res[c]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is `n-1`, `l` and `r` are indices related to array operations.**

This means that the value of `res[c]` is updated to be the result of `ans % m % MOD`. All other variables retain their previous states.
