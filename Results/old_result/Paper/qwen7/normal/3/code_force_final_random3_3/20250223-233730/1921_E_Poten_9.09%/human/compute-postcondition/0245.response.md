Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases, each consisting of six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. The function returns different values based on the conditions provided for these integers.**

- For each test case, the function checks if x_a is not equal to x_b or y_a is not equal to y_b.
- If the condition is met, the function processes the values of h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b according to the given constraints.
- The function does not return a single value but processes multiple test cases, returning outputs for each case based on the specified conditions.
