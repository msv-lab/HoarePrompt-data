Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `j` which iterates over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `ma` is 0
   - `mi` is 1
   - `m` is an input integer
   - `s` is a non-empty string starting with 'B'
   - `c` is 1
   - `d` is 0
   - `l` is an empty list
   - `j` is the first character of `s` which is 'B'
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `s`, and `j` is currently set to the first character ('B'), the next character in `s` will be the second character.
   - The string `s` is non-empty and starts with 'B', so it must have at least two characters.
   - Therefore, the loop can continue as long as there are more characters in `s`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will now be the second character of `s`.
   - `s` remains the same as it is being iterated over.
   - All other variables (`ma`, `mi`, `m`, `c`, `d`, `l`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Given the above analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`ma` is 0, `mi` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string starting with 'B', `c` is 1, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the second character of `s`**.
