Output State: **`left` is an integer such that 0 <= left < right < n; `right` is an integer such that 0 <= left < right < n; `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier; `small_element` is left + 1.**

This means that the value of `small_element` has been updated to be `left + 1`, while the values of `left`, `right`, and `clique` remain unchanged from their initial state.
