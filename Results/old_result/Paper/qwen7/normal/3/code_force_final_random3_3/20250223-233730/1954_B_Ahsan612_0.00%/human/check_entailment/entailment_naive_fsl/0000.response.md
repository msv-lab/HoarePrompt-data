Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove from the array to make it non-beautiful. Specifically, the program does not account for the possibility of removing elements in a way that breaks the beauty condition.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

### Counterexample:
**Input:**
```
4
3
2 2 2
5
1 2 1 2 1
1
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-1
1
-1
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
-1
1
-1
1
```

### Explanation of the Issue:
- For the third test case `[1]`, the output is `-1`, which is correct because the array is already non-beautiful.
- For the fourth test case `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program outputs `1` instead of `3`. The correct approach would be to remove the first three elements `[3, 3, 3]` to get `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful. However, the program only considers the first occurrence of a different element and removes just one element, which is incorrect.

The program needs to correctly identify the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements and then calculate the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.
