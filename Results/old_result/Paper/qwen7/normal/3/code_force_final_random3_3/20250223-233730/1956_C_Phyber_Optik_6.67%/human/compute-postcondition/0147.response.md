The initial state does not provide a specific value for `n`. Therefore, we need to consider the general case where `n` is some positive integer.

When the `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement is executed, it will print the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

To illustrate with a concrete example, if `n` were 5, the output would be:

```
1 2 3 4 5
```

However, since `n` is not specified, we will express the output in a general form.

Output: **1 2 3 ... (n-1) n**
