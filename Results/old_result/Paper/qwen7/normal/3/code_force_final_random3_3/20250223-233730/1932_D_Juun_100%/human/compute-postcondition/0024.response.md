Output State: **`card` is no longer used, `rank` is the rank part of the original `card`, `suit` is the suit part of the original `card`, `trumps` is unchanged, `suits[suit]` is `None`, `answers` now contains one more element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` (which is now `None`) or `rank` and `suit` with a space in between.**

This means that the `suits[suit]` entry has been set to `None`, and the last element in the `answers` list is updated to include the joined string of `rank` and `suit` separated by a space.
