Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a non-empty list of integers with `i` being the third element, `pl` is a list containing at least one element `i` with `i` appended, and for keys `i` not in `pl`, `d[i]` is incremented by 1 for each key `i` not in `pl` before the if statement, and for keys already in `pl`, `d[i]` remains 1, and after the if-else block, `pl` contains `i` as its last element.
