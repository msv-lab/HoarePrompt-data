Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 1`, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 2^(n-1)`, `s` is `p[s] - 2^(n-1)`, `bm` is the maximum value of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` after `n` iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` after `n` iterations, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` added `n` times to `sp`, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` added `n` times to `bp`, and `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`. The condition `(bm < sm)` is true.**
