Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads integers t, n, x, and y (where t is a positive integer up to 10^4, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and the minimum of n or 2â‹…10^5, and y is always 0), along with a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n. It then prints x - 2 for each test case. After processing all test cases, it ensures that the variable t is set to 0.**
