Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `w`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `int(w // 1)`, which means `i` starts at `1` and increments until it reaches `int(w // 1)`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `q` is a perfect square.
   - `w` is an integer greater than 0.
   - There exists an integer `i` such that `q % i == 0` and `i` is `i + 1`.
   - If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing the value of `i`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged, and `M` is updated by adding `q // i` to it.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - The new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - We need to check if `i + 1` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` to determine how `M` will be updated.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `q` remains a perfect square.
   - `w` remains an integer greater than 0.
   - `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `M` will either remain unchanged or be updated based on the condition `i + 1 >= x - 1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`q` is a perfect square, `w` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, and `M` remains unchanged unless `i + 1 >= x - 1`, in which case `M` is a list containing the value of `i + 1`.**
