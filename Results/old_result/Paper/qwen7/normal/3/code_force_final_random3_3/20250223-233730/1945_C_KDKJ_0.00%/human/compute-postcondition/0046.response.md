Output State: **`i` is 1, `left` is `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is `S[1][0] + S[1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`, `left` is `S[1][0]`**

Explanation: The code updates `lsum` to `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `lsum` is now updated to `S[1][0] + S[1][1]`. The other variables (`i`, `left`, and `rsum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
