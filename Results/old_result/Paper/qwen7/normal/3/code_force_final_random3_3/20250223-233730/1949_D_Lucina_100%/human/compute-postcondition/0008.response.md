Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\), and the current value of `a[i]` is increased by 1.**

The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify its exact value, but we know that `a[i]` is increased by 1. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
