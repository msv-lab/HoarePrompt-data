Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
- `k` is either `a + (b + c) // 3` or `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1 depending on whether `(b + c) % 3` is not equal to 0.

The value of `k` is determined by the formula involving `a`, `b`, and `c`. Specifically, `k` is calculated as follows:
- If `(b + c) % 3 == 0`, then `k = a + (b + c) // 3`.
- Otherwise, `k = a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `k`. However, we know the structure of how `k` is computed.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `k` based on the given conditions.

Output: **k (where k is either a + (b + c) // 3 or a + (b + c) // 3 + 1 depending on whether (b + c) % 3 is not equal to 0)**
