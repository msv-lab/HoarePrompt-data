Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 2 and less than or equal to 8, `i` is 1, `ans` is 'AAASSSsSS', `x` is 3, `j` is 3**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` appends twice the character at index `x` of the string `s` to the end of the string `ans`. Given that `x` is 3, `s[x]` refers to the character at index 3 of the string `'AAASSS'`, which is 'S'. Therefore, `s[x] * 2` results in 'SS'. The updated value of `ans` becomes 'AAASSS' + 'SS', which is 'AAASSSsSS'. All other variables remain unchanged.
