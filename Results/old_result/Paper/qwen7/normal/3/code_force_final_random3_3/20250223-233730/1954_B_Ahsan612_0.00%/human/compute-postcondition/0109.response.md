Output State: **`minn` is set to infinity, `same` is 1, `num` is the third element of the list `ar`, `i` is 3**.

Explanation: The code `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of the element at index `i` (which is 3) in the list `ar` to the variable `num`. The other variables (`minn`, `same`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `num` now holds the value of the third element in the list `ar`, while `minn` and `same` retain their original values.
