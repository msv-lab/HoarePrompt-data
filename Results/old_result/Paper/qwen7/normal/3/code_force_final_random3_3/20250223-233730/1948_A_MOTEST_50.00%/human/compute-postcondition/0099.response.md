Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(n // 2 - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `j < n // 2 - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 2
   - `n` is an odd integer greater than 5
   - `ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`
   - `x` is increased by 1

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `j < n // 2 - 1`. With `j` now being 3, `n` must be such that `3 < n // 2 - 1`, which simplifies to `n > 8`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is 3, `n` is an odd integer greater than 8, `ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`, `x` is increased by 1**
