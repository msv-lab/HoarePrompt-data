Postcondition: `x` is an integer, `rev_val` is a list, `rev_res` is a string. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the original string with the additional character `val_in` appended, where `val_in` is equal to `rev_val[x]`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the original string concatenated with the reverse of `val_in`, where `val_in` is equal to `rev_val[x]`.
