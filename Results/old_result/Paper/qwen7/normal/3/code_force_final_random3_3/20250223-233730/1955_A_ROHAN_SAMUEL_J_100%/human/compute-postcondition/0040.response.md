Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - (number of iterations - 1), n, a, and b are integers as described, and all iterations of the loop have been executed.**

In this final state, `t` will be reduced by the number of iterations minus one because each iteration consumes one unit from `t`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged throughout the loop's execution, as they are not modified within the loop body unless explicitly changed by user input or external factors not described in the problem statement. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will reflect the remaining number of test cases to be processed, which is `t` minus the total number of iterations that have occurred.
