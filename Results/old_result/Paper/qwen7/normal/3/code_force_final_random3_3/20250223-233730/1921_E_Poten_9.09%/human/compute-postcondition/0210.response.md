Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', and 'Alice', `i` is 4, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code appends 'Alice' to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` contains 'Bob' and 'Draw'. After appending 'Alice', `answers` becomes a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', and 'Alice'. Additionally, the variable `i` is incremented by 1 because the `append` method increases the length of the list by 1, and the original value of `i` was 3, so now `i` is 4. The precondition that `test_cases` must be greater than 3 remains unchanged, and the value of `clues` remains the same as it was before the code execution.
