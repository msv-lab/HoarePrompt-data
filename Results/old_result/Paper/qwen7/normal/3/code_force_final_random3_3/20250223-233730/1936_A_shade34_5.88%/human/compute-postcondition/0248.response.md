Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is less than `len(pans)`: This means `i` is a valid index within the range of the list `pans`.
   - `mak` is equal to `i + 1`: This means `mak` is the index immediately following `i` in the list `pans`.
   - The input equals `'>'`: This piece of information is not directly used in the print statement but might be relevant for context.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

Given the initial state, let's determine the values being printed:

- `pans[mak]`: Since `mak` is `i + 1`, this refers to the element at index `i + 1` in the list `pans`.
- `pans[i]`: This refers to the element at index `i` in the list `pans`.

The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]`, repeated twice.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? [pans[i + 1]] [pans[i + 1]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]]'**
