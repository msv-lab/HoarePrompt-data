Output State: **`max_diff` is equal to `diff`, `next_max_diff` is `-inf` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise it is updated to `diff` if `diff > next_max_diff`, `index` is `i`.**

Explanation: The code `index = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `index`. The values of `max_diff` and `next_max_diff` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `index` and retains the conditions for `max_diff` and `next_max_diff` as described in the initial state.
