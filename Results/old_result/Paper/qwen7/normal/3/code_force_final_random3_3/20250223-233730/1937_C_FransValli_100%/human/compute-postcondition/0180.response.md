Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n`.
   - `n` is used as the upper bound for the range function.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Check the initial value of `i` relative to `n`**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to `n`, the loop condition `i < n` will not be satisfied at the start, meaning the loop will not execute.

5. **Adjust the states to allow the loop to execute**:
   - To make the loop execute at least once, `i` must be less than `n` at the start of the loop. Therefore, `i` should be set to a value less than `n`.

Given this analysis, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is less than `n` at the start of the loop. The other variables (`arr`, `maxi`, `res`, and `mini`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`total` is 10, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is unchanged, `arr` is [0], `maxi` is `n-1`, `res` is an input string, `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'` if the loop executes `n-1` times**
