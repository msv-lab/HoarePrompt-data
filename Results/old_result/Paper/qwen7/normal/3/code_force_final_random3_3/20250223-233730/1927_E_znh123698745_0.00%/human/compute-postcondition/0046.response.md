Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - The loop condition checks if \((-1)^i\) equals -1. Since \(i = 1\), \((-1)^1 = -1\), so the condition is true.
   - Therefore, `array[a[-1]]` is appended to `answer` and `a[-1]` is decreased by 1.
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the logic, we can infer that `a[-1]` is decreased by 1.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value of 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`, and since `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute again.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2**
