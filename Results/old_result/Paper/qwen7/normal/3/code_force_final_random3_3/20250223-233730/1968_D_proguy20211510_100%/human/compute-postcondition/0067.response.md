Output State: **`i` is 3, `preb` is `preb + pathb[0] + pathb[1]`, `k` is less than `i + 1`, `curr` is `preb + pathb[0] * (k - i) + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, and `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `curr`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state had `i` as 2, `preb` as `preb + pathb[0]`, and `curr` as `preb + pathb[0] * (k - i) + pathb[i] * (k - i)`.
- The code updates `preb` by adding `pathb[i]` to it. Since `i` was 2, `i` is now 3, and `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[0] + pathb[1]`.
- The other conditions and variables (`k`, `curr`, and `resb`) remain unchanged because the code does not affect them directly.
