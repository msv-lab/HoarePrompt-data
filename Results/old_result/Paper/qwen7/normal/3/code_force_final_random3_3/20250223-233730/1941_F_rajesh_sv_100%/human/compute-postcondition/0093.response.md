Output State: **`h` is equal to `mid`, `mid_sum` is updated to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is updated to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `ans` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `mid` remains unchanged, `mid_sum` remains unchanged, `mid_next_sum` remains unchanged, `left` remains unchanged, `right` remains unchanged, `f` remains unchanged, `D` remains unchanged, `l < h` must still hold true.**

This means that the value of `h` has been updated to be equal to `mid`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
