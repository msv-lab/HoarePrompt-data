Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `l` is equal to the index returned by bisect_right(D, left - f), `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, `h` is bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1, `f` is the next element in F.
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `l` is updated to either `mid + 1` or `l + (h - l) // 2`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `h` is updated to either `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1` or `mid`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `left` and `right` must be chosen such that there is at least one element in `D` between `left - f` and `right - f`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `l` is an integer less than `h`; `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1` and `h` must be greater than `l`. Otherwise, `h` is set to `mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is `mid + 1` and `h` is greater than `l`. Otherwise, `h` is `mid` and `l` is an integer less than `h`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
