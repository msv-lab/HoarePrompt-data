Postcondition: **`s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the third element of the same tuple, `n` is a positive integer inputted initially, `eli` is updated to the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`, `l` and `r` are assigned the values of two integers inputted via `input().split()` and converted to integers using `map(int)`, and the number of remaining iterations is reduced by 1, regardless of whether `e >= r` or not.**
