Postcondition: `i` is equal to `x + 1`, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 5, `z` is the final value obtained after performing the operation `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 1 to `x + 1`, and either the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z` or `a` is less than `z`.
