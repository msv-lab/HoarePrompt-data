Output State: **`tmp` must not be empty, y is decreased by i-1, ans is increased by i.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is decreased by `i - 1`. The values of `tmp` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `tmp` must not be empty, `y` is now `y - (i - 1)`, and `ans` is increased by `i`.
