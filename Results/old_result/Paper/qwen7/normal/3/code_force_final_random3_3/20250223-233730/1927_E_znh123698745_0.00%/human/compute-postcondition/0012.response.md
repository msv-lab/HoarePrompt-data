Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 1; \((-1)^i\) is equal to 1; `a[0]` is increased by 1; `answer` now contains the element `array[a[0]]`.**

Explanation: The code `a[0] += 1` increments the value of `a[0]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 1, `n` must still be greater than 1, \((-1)^i\) is still equal to 1, and `answer` still contains the element `array[a[0]]`, but now `a[0]` has been incremented by 1.
