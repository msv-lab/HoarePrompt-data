Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `y` in the range `range(x - 1, 0, -1)`. This means `y` will take values from `x-1` down to `1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `y` must be greater than `1` (since the loop starts from `x-1` and goes down to `1`). 

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `y` will be decremented by 1 from its current value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The variable `x` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

4. **Postconditions**:
   - The postcondition states that `max_sum` is the maximum value between its original value (0) and `current_sum`.
   - `best_y` is either its original value (1) or `y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`.
   - The `results` list still contains 1.
   - The most internal loop or if statement is exited.

Given these points, let's assume the following at the end of the previous iteration:
- `max_sum` is the maximum value between its original value (0) and `current_sum`.
- `best_y` is either its original value (1) or `y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`.
- `results` list still contains 1.
- The most internal loop or if statement is exited.

For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by 1 and should still be greater than `1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `y` will be `y - 1`.
- All other variables (`max_sum`, `best_y`, `results`) remain unchanged.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`max_sum` is the maximum value between its original value (0) and `current_sum`, `best_y` is either its original value (1) or `y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `results` list still contains 1, and `y` is `y - 1`**.
