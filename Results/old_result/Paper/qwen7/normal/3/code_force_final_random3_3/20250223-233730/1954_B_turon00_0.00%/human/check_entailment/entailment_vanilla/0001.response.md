### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given array to make it non-beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` when `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if all elements in the array are the same using a set (`aa`). If they are, it prints `-1` because the array cannot be made non-beautiful.
   - It initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and uses a set `aa` to track unique elements.
   - It iterates through the array to count consecutive occurrences of the same element (`cnt`).
   - It updates the answer (`ans`) with the minimum count of consecutive occurrences found.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum count of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Key Points to Verify**:
   - The logic for checking if the array is already uniform (all elements the same) is correct.
   - The counting of consecutive occurrences and updating the answer seems to follow the requirement of making the array non-beautiful.
   - The solution correctly handles the constraints and examples provided.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array is already uniform, the solution correctly outputs `-1`.
   - The solution correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.

### Conclusion:
The given program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all the given constraints and examples properly.

### Correctness:
**True**
