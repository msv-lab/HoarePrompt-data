Output State: **`tree` now contains the current element `curr`; `prev` is equal to `curr`, and `curr` is updated to `nodes[curr][1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` to `nodes[curr][1]`. At the same time, the previous value of `curr` (which is stored in `prev`) remains unchanged. Therefore, `prev` is still equal to the original value of `curr`.
