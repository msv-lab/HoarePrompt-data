Output State: **`max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 1`, the `results` list now contains 1, `gcd_val` is unchanged, `x` is the next value from `test_cases`, `y` is `x - 1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y, `best_y` is `x - 1**.

Explanation: The code updates `best_y` to the current value of `y`. Since `y` is defined as `x - 1`, `best_y` is also set to `x - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
