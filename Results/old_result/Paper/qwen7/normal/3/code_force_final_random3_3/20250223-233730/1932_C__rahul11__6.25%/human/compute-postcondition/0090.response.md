Postcondition: `c` is increased by 1, `ans` is either the integer value of `ans` divided by `arr[l]` modulo `MOD` or `ans` divided by `arr[r]` modulo `MOD`, `res[c]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is `n-1`, `l` and `r` are adjusted accordingly (either `l` is increased by 1 or `r` is decreased by 1).
