Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(n // 2 - 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans` is 'AAASSS'.
   - `x` is 3.
   - `j` is 2.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs as long as `j < n // 2 - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.

4. **Calculate the new value of `j`**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 3.

5. **Check if the loop condition is satisfied**:
   - We need to check if `j < n // 2 - 1` still holds true.
   - Since `j` is now 3, we need to ensure that `3 < n // 2 - 1` is false (because the loop would stop if it were true).

6. **Determine the value of `n`**:
   - For `3 < n // 2 - 1` to be false, `n // 2 - 1` must be less than or equal to 3.
   - Therefore, `n // 2 - 1 <= 3` implies `n // 2 <= 4` and thus `n <= 8`.

7. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` is now 3.
   - `n` must be such that `n <= 8` and `n > 2`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 2 and less than or equal to 8, `i` is 1, `ans` is 'AAASSS', `x` is 3, `j` is 3**
