Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i+1][1]`; `rsum` is `n - (i + 1)`; `right` is updated to `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of the variable `right` to `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `right`.
