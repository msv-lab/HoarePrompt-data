Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `right - f[0]` - 1 and `h` is not equal to `l`, `l` is less than `h`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the new value of `mid` using the formula `l + (h - l) // 2`. This formula is commonly used in binary search algorithms to find the middle index between `l` and `h`. The values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code. The conditions on `h` and `l` also remain valid.
