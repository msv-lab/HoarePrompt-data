Output State: **`i` is 1, `flag` is a boolean, `s` is a string such that the character at index 1 of `s` is '0'.**

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '0'` changes the character at index `i` (which is 1) of the string `s` to '0'. The values of `i` and `flag` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 1, `flag` is still a boolean, and the character at index 1 of `s` is now '0'.
