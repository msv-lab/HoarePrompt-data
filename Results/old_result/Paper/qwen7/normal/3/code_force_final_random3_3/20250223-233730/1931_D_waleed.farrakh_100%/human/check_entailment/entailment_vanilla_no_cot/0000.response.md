Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The `func_2` function reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases. It correctly parses the input and passes it to `func_1`.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: In `func_1`, the program calculates the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)` using a dictionary `freq`. This helps in counting how many times a particular pair has occurred.

3. **Beautiful Pair Check**: For each element `a` in the array, the program computes the remainder when `a` is divided by `x` and `y`. It then checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in the frequency dictionary. If it does, it adds the count of that pair to the total count of beautiful pairs.

4. **Modulo Adjustments**: The program ensures that negative remainders are adjusted to positive values by using `(-a % x + x) % x` to handle cases where `a % x` might be negative.

5. **Output**: The results for each test case are correctly printed.

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the program accurately counts the number of beautiful pairs as defined. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **True**.
