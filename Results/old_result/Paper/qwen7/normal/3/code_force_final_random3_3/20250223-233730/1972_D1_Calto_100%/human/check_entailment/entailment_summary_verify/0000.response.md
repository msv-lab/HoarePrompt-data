### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Function 1 Analysis:
This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This is correct and will be used in the main function to check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Function 2 Analysis:
The function `func_2` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\). However, the provided function summary suggests a different logic:
- After the loop, `cnt` is set to 8, `i` is 5, `m` is at least 3, `x` is -21, and `y` is 25.

This summary indicates that the function is not correctly implementing the problem's requirements. Specifically, the variables `x` and `y` do not appear to be relevant to the problem, and the value of `cnt` being set to 8 is not derived from the problem's constraints.

Let's verify the logic step-by-step:
1. The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`.
2. Inside the loop, `x` is calculated as `n - (i * i - i)`, and `y` is calculated as `i * i`.
3. The value of `cnt` is updated using `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

Given the test case \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\):
- For \(i = 1\): \(x = 2 - (1*1 - 1) = 2\), \(y = 1\), `cnt` is updated to 2.
- For \(i = 2\): \(x = 2 - (2*2 - 2) = -2\), \(y = 4\), `cnt` is updated to 2.
- For \(i = 3\): \(x = 2 - (3*3 - 3) = -8\), \(y = 9\), `cnt` is updated to 2.

Clearly, this logic does not match the expected output of 3 valid pairs. The function summary also indicates that after the loop, `cnt` is set to 8, which is incorrect.

#### Correct Logic:
The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem.

**Final: False**
