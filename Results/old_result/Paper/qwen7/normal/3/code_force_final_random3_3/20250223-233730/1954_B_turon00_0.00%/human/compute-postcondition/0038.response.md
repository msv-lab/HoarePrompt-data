Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to the variable `n`. The other variables (`ans`, `cnt`, `i`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Specifically, `cnt` is set to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, and `t` is `t-1`. The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, which remains 0 since `cnt` is 0.
