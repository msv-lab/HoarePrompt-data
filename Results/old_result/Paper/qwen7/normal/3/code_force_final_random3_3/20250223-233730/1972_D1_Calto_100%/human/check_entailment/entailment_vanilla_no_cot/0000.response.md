Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution contains a misunderstanding of the problem statement and an incorrect implementation of the logic required to solve it. Let's break down why this is incorrect:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The `func_1` function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This part is correct.

2. **Main Logic Error**: The main logic in `func_2` does not correctly implement the conditions specified in the problem statement. Specifically, the problem requires checking pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The current implementation of `func_2` does not check these conditions at all. Instead, it attempts to count something related to squares and multiples, which is irrelevant to the problem.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if they satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

This code correctly iterates through all pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges and checks if they satisfy the required condition.
