Output State: **`eta` is a list containing the integers `1` and `1`; `q` is a list with elements updated according to the loop's execution; `j` is `2`; `n` is a non-negative integer.**

Explanation: The code `eta.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` (which is `1`) to the list `eta`. After appending, `eta` contains the integers `1` and `1`. The values of `q`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
