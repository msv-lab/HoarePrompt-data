Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to 4.
- `n` is between 3 and 50 inclusive.
- The condition `v[v[v[i]]] != i` holds true.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(3)
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the number 3, regardless of the values of `i`, `n`, or the condition involving `v`.

Output: **3**
