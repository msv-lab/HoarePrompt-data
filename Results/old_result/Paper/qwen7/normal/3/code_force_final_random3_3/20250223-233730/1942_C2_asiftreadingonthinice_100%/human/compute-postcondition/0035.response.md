Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the sum of all increments made to it during the loop plus 1, `tmp` contains all the values added to it whenever `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and equals to 2 modulo 2, and the value of `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is equal to 2.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
