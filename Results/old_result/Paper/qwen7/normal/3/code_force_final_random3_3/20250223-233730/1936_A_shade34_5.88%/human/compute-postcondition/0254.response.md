Based on the initial state provided:

- After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(pans)`.
- `mak` will be equal to `len(pans) - 1`.
- The input has been read `n` times.

We need to determine the values of `mak` and `mak2` to be printed. Since `mak2` is not defined in the initial state, it must be assumed to be the same as `mak` unless otherwise specified.

Given:
- `mak = len(pans) - 1`

Since `mak2` is not explicitly defined and no other information is provided, we assume `mak2` is also `len(pans) - 1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **! [len(pans) - 1] [len(pans) - 1]**
