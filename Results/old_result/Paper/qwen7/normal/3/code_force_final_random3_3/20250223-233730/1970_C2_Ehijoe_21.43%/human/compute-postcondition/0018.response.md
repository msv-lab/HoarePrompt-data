Output State: **The `leaves` variable is initialized as a deque object, and the `nodes` dictionary remains unchanged from its previous state, representing the entire graph structure where each node points to all nodes it is directly connected to.**

Explanation: The line `leaves = deque()` initializes the `leaves` variable as a deque object. This does not affect the `nodes` dictionary, which was previously constructed by appending nodes to each other's lists during the loop. Therefore, the `nodes` dictionary retains its previous state, representing the graph structure.
