Output State: **`xx` is a list containing the string `x`, `a` is a list with counts of 'F' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`, `b` is a list with counts of 'S' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `3`, `b[i]` is `1`**.

Explanation: The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` in the list `b` by 1. Given that `i` is `n + 1`, the value at `b[n + 1]` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `b` is not specified, we only know that `b[n + 1]` was incremented to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
