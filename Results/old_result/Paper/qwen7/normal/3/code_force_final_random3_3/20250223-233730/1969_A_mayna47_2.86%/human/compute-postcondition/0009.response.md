Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is between 3 and 50 inclusive, but its exact value is not specified.
- `v` is a list where the element at index `v[v[1]]` is equal to 1.

The print statement is simply `print(2)`. This means it will print the integer 2 directly, without any dependency on the values of `i`, `n`, or `v`.

Output: **2**
