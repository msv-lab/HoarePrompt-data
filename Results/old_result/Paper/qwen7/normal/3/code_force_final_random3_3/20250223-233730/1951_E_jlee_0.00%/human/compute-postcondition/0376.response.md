Postcondition: `done` remains `False`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is an index within the string such that `j + 1` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, `count` is equal to `j`, `s` is a list representation of the string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first element of the list `s`, and if `x` is not equal to the last element of the list `s`, then `i` is incremented by 1.
