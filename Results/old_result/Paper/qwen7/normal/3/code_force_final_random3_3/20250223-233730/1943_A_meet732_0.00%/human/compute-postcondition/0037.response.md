Output State: **`j` is 3, `cntl[2]` is less than 2, `c` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. Since no variables are modified within the given code snippet, the values of `j`, `cntl[2]`, and `c` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the loop or if statement, but no new values are assigned to any variables.
