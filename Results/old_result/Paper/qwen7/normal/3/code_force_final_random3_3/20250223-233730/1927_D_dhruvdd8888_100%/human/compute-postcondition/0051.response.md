Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is assigned the value of the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `e` is assigned the value of the third element of the same tuple.
- `n` is a positive integer inputted initially.
- `s` is less than or equal to `l`.
- `e` is less than `r`.
- The current value of `e` is less than `N`.

The `print(s, e + 1)` statement will print the value of `s` followed by the value of `e + 1`.

To summarize:
- `s` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `e` is the third element of the same tuple.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **s, e + 1**
