Output State: **`data` is a list containing strings split from the input, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `idx` is 0, and the values of `n` and the list `a` will be determined later based on the input.**

The code initializes the variable `idx` to 0. Since the initial values of `data`, `t`, `n`, and `a` are not altered by this line of code, they remain as described in the initial state.
