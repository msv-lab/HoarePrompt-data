### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and handling of the test cases. However, there are a few points to verify and ensure the program behaves as expected for all edge cases.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**:
   - The program reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` correctly using `map(int, input().split())`. This part is also correct.

3. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The program checks if `n` is odd and then compares `2 * a` with `b` to decide the minimum cost.
   - If `n` is even, it directly compares `2 * a` with `b` to decide the minimum cost.
   - The logic for calculating the cost when `n` is odd is slightly off. Specifically, the condition `2 * a < b` should be checked before deciding to use the promotion price for the last yogurt.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Odd Number of Yogurts (`n % 2 == 1`)**:
  - The program should calculate the cost by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price.
  - The current logic prints `n // 2 * b + a` if `2 * a >= b`, which is correct.
  - However, the logic should also consider the scenario where buying the last yogurt at the regular price is cheaper than buying it at the promotion price. Therefore, the correct logic should be:
    ```python
    if 2 * a < b:
        print(a * n)
    else:
        print(n // 2 * b + a if n % 2 == 1 else n // 2 * b)
    ```

- **Even Number of Yogurts (`n % 2 == 0`)**:
  - The program correctly checks if `2 * a < b` and prints the appropriate cost.
  - The logic for even `n` is correct.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a if n % 2 == 1 else n // 2 * b)
        else:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b)
```

### Final Evaluation:

After reviewing the logic and ensuring it handles all edge cases correctly, the program is indeed correct according to the problem description.

Final: **True**
