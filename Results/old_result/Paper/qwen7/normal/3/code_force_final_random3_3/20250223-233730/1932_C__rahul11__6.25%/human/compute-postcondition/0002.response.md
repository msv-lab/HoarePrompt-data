Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer input within this range, `m` is the second integer input within this range.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that the user must provide two space-separated integers as input. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n` and `m`, respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds a positive integer within the specified range.
