Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, each element `a[j]` in the list `a` is increased by `j + 1` for every `j` in the range `0` to `n-1`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, each element `a[j]` in the list `a` will have been incremented by `(j + 1)` where `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`.
