Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the string input by the user without any leading or trailing spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().strip()` takes an input from the user and stores it in the variable `a`. The `.strip()` method removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the input. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
