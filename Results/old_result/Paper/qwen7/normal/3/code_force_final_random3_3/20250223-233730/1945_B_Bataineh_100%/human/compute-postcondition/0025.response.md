Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers separated by spaces from the input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 1 and `t` is still an integer between 1 and \(10^4\). The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are the integers read from the input.
