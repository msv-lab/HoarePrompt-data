Output State: **`k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 2`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] + sp + 2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp + a[b]`, `i` is `i_prev + 3`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `bm` to be the maximum of its current value and the expression `a[b] * k + bp`. Since `k` is -2 and `b` is `p[b] - 2`, the updated value of `bm` is `max(bm, a[p[b] - 2] * (-2) + bp)`. The values of `b`, `s`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
