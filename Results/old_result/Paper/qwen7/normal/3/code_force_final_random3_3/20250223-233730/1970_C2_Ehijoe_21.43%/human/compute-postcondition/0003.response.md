Output State: **`empty` is True, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, and `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list.**

Explanation: The line `nodes = defaultdict(list)` creates a new dictionary-like object called `nodes` with a default factory set to `list`. This means that if a key is accessed that does not exist in `nodes`, it will automatically create a new list for that key. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
