Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers obtained from input, `minn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `same`, `num` is set to the last `min(minn, same)` value found, `same` is 1, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `same = 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `same`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
