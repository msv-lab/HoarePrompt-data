Output State: **`k` is the input value of `k` decremented by 1, `n` is the input value of `n`, `array` is a list containing numbers from 1 to `n`, `answer` is a list containing the number 1, `a` is a list containing `[1, -1]`.**

The code initializes a list `a` with the values `[1, -1]`. This does not affect the values of `k`, `n`, `array`, or `answer`. Therefore, their states remain as they were in the initial state.
