Output State: **`j` is 2, `i` is 0, `start_index` is 0, `arr[0]` is 1, `arr[1]` is 1, `arr[2]` is 1**.

Explanation: The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called with `i - 1` as the argument. Initially, `i` is 1, so `make_stairs(0)` is called. The function `make_stairs` continues to decrement `i` until `i` becomes 0. During each call, the loop sets each element from `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive) to the value of `i`. Since `i` was 1 for the last iteration and remained 1 for subsequent iterations until it reached 0, all elements from `start_index` to `start_index + i` were set to 1. With `start_index` being 0 and `i` being 1 for the final iteration, `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[2]` are all set to 1. After the loop ends, `i` becomes 0. The values of `j`, `start_index`, and the array `arr` remain unchanged.
