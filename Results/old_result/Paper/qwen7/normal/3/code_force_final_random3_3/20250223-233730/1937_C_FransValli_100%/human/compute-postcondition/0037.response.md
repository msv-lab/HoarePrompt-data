Postcondition: `i` is a value in the range [1, n-1], `n` must be at least 4, `res` is a string, and `arr` is a list containing the value of `i`. If `res` is equal to '<', `arr` contains the value of `i`. If `res` is not equal to '<' and equals '=', `arr` remains unchanged. If `res` is neither '<' nor '=', `arr` still contains the value of `i`.
