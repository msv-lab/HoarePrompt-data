Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `j` and the condition `range(1, n + 1)`.

2. **Understand the Initial States**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `x` is an input string.
   - `a` and `b` are lists determined based on the characters in the string `x`.
   - `xx` contains the string `x`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3.
   - For the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` should be 4.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `1` to `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1, `j` will become 4.
   - There are no changes required for `i`, `x`, `a`, `b`, or `xx` as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is 4, `x` is an input string, `a` and `b` are determined based on the characters in the string `x`, and `xx` contains the string `x`.**
