Output State: **`rank` is the rank part of the next `card`; `suit` is the suit part of the next `card`; `trump` remains the suit part of the next `card`; `trumps` is the list with the values appended as per the previous iterations; `suits[suit]` is updated as per the previous iterations.**

Explanation: The code `rank, suit = card` unpacks the tuple `card` into two variables, `rank` and `suit`. This means `rank` now holds the rank part of the next `card`, and `suit` holds the suit part of the next `card`. The other variables (`trump`, `trumps`, and `suits[suit]`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
