Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), the value of `t` is updated to the input integer within this range. All other variables (`a`, `b`, and `c`) remain unchanged and are still within their specified ranges (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9).
