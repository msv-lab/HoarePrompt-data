Output State: **`t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `data` remains unchanged, `test_cases` is an empty list, `idx` is 1**.

This means that the variable `idx` has been assigned the value 1, while the values of `t`, `data`, and `test_cases` remain unchanged from their initial state.
