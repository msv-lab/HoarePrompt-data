Output State: **`i` is `mdx + 1`, `n` must be greater than `mdx`, `res` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is incremented by 1, but the initial values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still `mdx + 1`, `n` must still be greater than `mdx`, and `res` has been increased by 1.
