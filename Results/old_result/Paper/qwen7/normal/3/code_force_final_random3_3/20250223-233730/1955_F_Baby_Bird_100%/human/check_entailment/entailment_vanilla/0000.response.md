Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Given Program:**
   ```python
   def func():
       print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
   ```

3. **Breaking Down the Program:**
   - The function `func` reads an integer `t` which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a line of input containing four integers: `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p_4`.
   - It then processes these integers using a specific formula and prints the result.

4. **Formula Analysis:**
   - The formula inside the list comprehension is:
     ```python
     sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3
     ```
   - Here, `enumerate(map(int, input().split()))` converts the input into a list of integers and enumerates them.
   - For each integer `x` at index `i`, the expression `(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3))` is evaluated:
     - `x // 2` gives the integer division of `x` by 2.
     - `x % 2` gives the remainder when `x` is divided by 2.
     - `i < 3` checks if the index `i` is less than 3.
     - The expression `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)` calculates a value based on the type of number (`1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`).

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The formula does not directly relate to the XOR operation or the conditions for Alice and Bob to win.
   - The formula seems to be calculating a different value based on the indices and values of the input integers.
   - Given the problem description, the formula should be related to the optimal removal strategy to maximize Bob's wins.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
   - The formula used in the program does not align with the conditions for determining the maximum number of Bob's wins.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
