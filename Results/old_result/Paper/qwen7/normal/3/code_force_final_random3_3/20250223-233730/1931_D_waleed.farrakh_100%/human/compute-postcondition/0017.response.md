Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is unchanged, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` on spaces and converting each substring to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by taking the substring from `data` starting at index `idx + 1`, splitting it into substrings using spaces as delimiters, and then converting each substring into an integer. The original values of `data`, `idx`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
