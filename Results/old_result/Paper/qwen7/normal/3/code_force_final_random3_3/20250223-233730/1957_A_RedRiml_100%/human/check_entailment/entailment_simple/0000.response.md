### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `w` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Reading Stick Lengths**: For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `ln` and the lengths of the sticks `palka`. This is handled correctly.

3. **Counting Stick Frequencies**: It uses a dictionary `d` to count the frequency of each stick length. This is done correctly.

4. **Identifying Unique Stick Lengths**: It creates a list `pl` containing unique stick lengths. This is also correct.

5. **Calculating Number of Polygons**: 
   - For each unique stick length `j`, it checks if the count `d[j]` is at least 3.
   - If so, it adds `d[j] // 3` to `shapes`, which represents the number of polygons that can be formed with that stick length.
   - This logic is correct because each polygon requires 3 sticks of the same length.

6. **Output**: Finally, it prints the value of `shapes`, which is the total number of polygons that can be formed. This is correct.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from the given sticks.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
