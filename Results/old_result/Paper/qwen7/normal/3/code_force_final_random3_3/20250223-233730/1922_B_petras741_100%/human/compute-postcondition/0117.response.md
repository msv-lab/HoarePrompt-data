Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `q` is a list of n+1 elements, all initialized to 0**.

The code initializes a list `q` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The values of `i` and `w` remain unchanged from their initial states.
