Output State: **`not_mid` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`**

Explanation: The code sets the value of `arr[left + mid + i]` to `big_element - i`. Given that `i` is initially 0, the expression simplifies to `arr[left + mid] = big_element`. The values of `not_mid` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
