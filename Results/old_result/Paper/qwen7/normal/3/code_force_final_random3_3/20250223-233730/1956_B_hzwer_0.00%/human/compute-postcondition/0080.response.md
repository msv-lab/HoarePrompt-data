Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - `j` is `n-1`.
   - `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` where each element is updated based on the loop body.
   - `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
   - The `cards` list also remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Head**: 
   - The loop iterates over `j` in reverse order from `n-1` to 0.

3. **Loop Body**: 
   - If `i` is 0, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][j]`.
   - If `i` is 1, then `dp[1][n-1]` is updated to the maximum value between `dp[2][n-1]` and `dp[3][n-2] + 1` if `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, otherwise `dp` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `j`.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `j`.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates in reverse order, the next value of `j` will be `j - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n-1`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be `n-2`.

6. **Final State**:
   - `i` remains unchanged (either 0 or 1).
   - `j` is now `n-2`.
   - `dp` remains unchanged as no direct update to `dp` is mentioned in the loop body for this specific case.
   - `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
   - The `cards` list remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is `n-2`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` where each element is updated to the maximum value it can take based on the conditions specified in the loop body, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the `cards` list also remains unchanged.**
