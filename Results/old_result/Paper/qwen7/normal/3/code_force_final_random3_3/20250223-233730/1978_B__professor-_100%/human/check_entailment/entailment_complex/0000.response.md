Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The logic for calculating the maximum profit is as follows:
   - If `b <= a`, it means there's no benefit in applying the promotion, so it simply calculates the profit as `n * a`.
   - If `b - a >= n`, it means the promotion would not cover all buns, so it calculates the profit using the sum of an arithmetic series: `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit by considering the first `k` buns sold at the modified price and the rest sold at the usual price: `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`.

This logic aligns with the problem statement and correctly handles all given conditions. The provided example outputs match the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
