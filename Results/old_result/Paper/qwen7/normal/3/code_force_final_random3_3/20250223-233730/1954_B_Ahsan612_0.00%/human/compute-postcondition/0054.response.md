Output State: **`minn` is set to infinity, `ar` is a list of integers created from input, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `same` is 1, `num` is now the first element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between infinity and the maximum `same` value found during the loop execution, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The line `minn = inf` sets the variable `minn` to the value of `inf` (which is typically a constant representing infinity in Python). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
