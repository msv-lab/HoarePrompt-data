Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `j` is an index within the string, `done` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if the character at index `j` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1. If the characters are equal or any other condition fails, `done` remains unchanged and the conditions remain as they were.**
