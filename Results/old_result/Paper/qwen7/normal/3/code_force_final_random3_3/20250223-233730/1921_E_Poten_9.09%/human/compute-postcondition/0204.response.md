Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', either 'Bob' or 'Alice', and `i` is 4. Otherwise, if `clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` is true, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`, making `i` equal to 4. Otherwise, `answers` becomes ['Alice', 'Draw', 'Bob'], and `i` is also set to 4.**
