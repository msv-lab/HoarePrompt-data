The only objects in the loop head are the variables `result` and `results`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. For the loop to execute again, `results` must contain at least one element at the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `results` must contain at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`results` must contain at least one element**
