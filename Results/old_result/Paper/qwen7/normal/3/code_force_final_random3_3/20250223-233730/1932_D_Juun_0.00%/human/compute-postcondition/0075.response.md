Output State: `trumps` is an empty list.

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `trumps` will be an empty list because the loop continues to pop elements from `trumps` until it is empty. Since the loop condition checks if `trumps` is not empty (`while trumps != []`), once `trumps` becomes empty, the loop terminates. Therefore, after all iterations, `trumps` will be an empty list.
