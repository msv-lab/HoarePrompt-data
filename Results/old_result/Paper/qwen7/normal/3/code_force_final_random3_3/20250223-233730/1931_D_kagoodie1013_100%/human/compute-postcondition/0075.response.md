Output State: **The program returns a list named `results` that contains the cumulative sum of `count` values from all iterations. This list reflects the final count of occurrences of each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair across all arrays in `test_cases`. Additionally, the `residue_map` dictionary shows how many times each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair appeared in the arrays. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `num`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key` reflect their state just before the last element of the last array is processed.**

This means that after processing all elements in all arrays within `test_cases`, the program returns a list `results` which contains the total count of each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair found. The `residue_map` provides a detailed breakdown of these counts. The other variables mentioned are left in their state right before the last element of the last array is processed.
