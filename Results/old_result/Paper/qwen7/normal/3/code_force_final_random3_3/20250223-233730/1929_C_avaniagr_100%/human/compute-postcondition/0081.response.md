Output State: **`x` must be greater than `k - 5`; `z` is increased by `2 * (z // (k - 1) + 1)`**.

Explanation: The initial state is that `x` must be greater than `k - 5`. The code snippet updates `z` by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `z` or `k`, the updated value of `z` is expressed as `z` increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`, which is equivalent to `2 * (z // (k - 1) + 1)` due to the addition operation being applied twice. The condition for `x` remains unchanged.
