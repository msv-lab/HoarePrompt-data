Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from the input split.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increases by 1 with each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop body and is used only as the upper limit for the range function.

5. **State the new state**: After adjusting the state for the next iteration, the new state should reflect the updated value of `i` while keeping `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from the input split**.
