Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is an integer from input.
- `b` is an integer from input.
- `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.

The print statement is simply `print('No')`.

Since the print statement does not depend on the values of `a`, `b`, or `t`, it will always print the string 'No'.

Output: **No**
