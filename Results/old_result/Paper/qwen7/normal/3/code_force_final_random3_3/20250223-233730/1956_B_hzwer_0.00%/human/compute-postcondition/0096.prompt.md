Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `0`, `j` is `0`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` where each element is updated to the maximum value it can take based on the conditions specified in the loop body. Specifically, for each cell `dp[i][j]`, it is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]` depending on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the `cards` list also remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
    elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
    else:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is `n-1`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` where each element is updated to the maximum value it can take based on the conditions specified in the loop body, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the `cards` list also remains unchanged. If `i` is 0, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `i` is 1, then `dp[1][n-1]` is updated to the maximum value between `dp[2][n-1]` and `dp[3][n-2] + 1` if `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, otherwise `dp` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is `n-2`; `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1` and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]` if `cards.count(j + 1) != 0`; otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i + 1][j]`; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; the `cards` list also remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is `n-3`; `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1` if `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, otherwise `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1` and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; the `cards` list also remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
