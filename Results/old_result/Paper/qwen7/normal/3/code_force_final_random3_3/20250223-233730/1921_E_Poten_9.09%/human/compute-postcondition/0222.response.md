Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', and 'Alice', `i` is 4, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `answers.append('Alice')` adds the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` contains `'Bob'` and `'Draw'`, so after appending `'Alice'`, it now contains `'Bob'`, `'Draw'`, and `'Alice'`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 because the loop or conditional block that `i` was part of (implied by the initial state) would have executed one more time. All other variables remain unchanged.
