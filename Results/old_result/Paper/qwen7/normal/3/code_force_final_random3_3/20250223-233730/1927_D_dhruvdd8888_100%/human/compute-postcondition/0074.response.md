Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is controlled by the variable `_` which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter.
   - There are no other variables directly involved in the loop head itself.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`.
   - Each iteration of the loop does not change the loop control variable `_`.

3. **Determine the States to Adjust:**
   - Since the loop condition is based on the user input for the number of iterations, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the number of remaining iterations.
   - The initial state of `s`, `e`, `n`, `eli`, `l`, and `r` remains unchanged within the loop.

4. **Formulate the New State:**
   - After each iteration, the number of remaining iterations decreases by 1.
   - The state of `s`, `e`, `n`, `eli`, `l`, and `r` remains the same as they were at the start of the loop.

Given the above analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- The number of remaining iterations is reduced by 1.
- The values of `s`, `e`, `n`, `eli`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`s` is assigned the value of the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and remains 1 or a value greater than `r`; `e` is assigned the value of the third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and remains the third element of the tuple; `n` remains a positive integer inputted initially; `eli` is updated to the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`; `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer; the number of remaining iterations is reduced by 1.**
