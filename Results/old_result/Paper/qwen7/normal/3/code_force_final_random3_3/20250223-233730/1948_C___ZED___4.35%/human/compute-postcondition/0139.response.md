Based on the initial state provided:

- `no_path` is `True`
- `i` is `i_current + 1`
- `n` is an integer greater than 4
- `k` is `1`
- `a` is a new string input by the user
- `b` is the new input string

The `print(k)` statement will simply print the value of the variable `k`.

Given that `k` is explicitly stated to be `1`, the output will be:

Output: **1**
