Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n-2 except for `n-3`, `v1` is `n-3`, `v2` is `n-3`.**

Explanation: The initial state of `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n-2. The values of `v1` and `v2` are both `(n-3)`. The code removes `v1` (which is `n-3`) from `vx`. After removing `n-3` from `vx`, the set `vx` no longer contains `n-3`. The values of `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged as they are just references to the value `n-3`.
