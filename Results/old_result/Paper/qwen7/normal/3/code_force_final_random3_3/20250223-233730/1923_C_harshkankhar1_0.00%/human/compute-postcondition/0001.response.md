Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `c` is a list of n positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `a` is a list where the first element is 0 and the rest are the integers from the input split into a list.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` where the first element is 0, and the subsequent elements are the integers from the input split using `input().split()`. These integers are converted to integers using `int(x)` for each `x` in the split input. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial state.
