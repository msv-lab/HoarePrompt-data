Output State: **Postcondition: `k` is equal to `n-1` (the last even number less than or equal to `n`), `n` must be greater than 0, and `no_path` remains True unless there exists a `b[k]` that is not '>'.**

Explanation: The loop increments `k` by 2 in each iteration, starting from 0 up to but not including `n`. Therefore, after all iterations, `k` will be the largest even number less than or equal to `n`, which is `n-1` if `n` is odd, or `n-2` if `n` is even. The value of `no_path` remains True unless any `b[k]` (where `k` is incremented by 2 in each iteration) is not '>', in which case it becomes False. Given the conditions provided, `no_path` remains True as none of the checked characters in `b` were found to be anything other than '>' based on the provided output states after the first three iterations.
