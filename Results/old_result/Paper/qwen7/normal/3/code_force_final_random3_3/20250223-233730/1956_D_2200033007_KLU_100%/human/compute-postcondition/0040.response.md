Output State: `j` is 2, `i` is 1, `start_index` is 0, `arr[0]` is 1, `arr[1]` is 1, `arr[2]` is 1.

Explanation: Given the loop continues as long as `i` is not zero and considering the output state after 3 iterations, it's clear that `i` was decremented from its initial value to 1 over these iterations. The loop sets each element from `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive) to the value of `i`. Since `i` was 1 for the last iteration and remained 1 for subsequent iterations until it reached 0, all elements from `start_index` to `start_index + i` were set to 1. With `start_index` being 0 and `i` being 1 for the final iteration, `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[2]` are all set to 1.
