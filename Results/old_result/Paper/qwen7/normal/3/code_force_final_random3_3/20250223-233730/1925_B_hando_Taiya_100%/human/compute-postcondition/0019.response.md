Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and 2, and `i` is 2. If `n` is less than or equal to `x // 2`, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
