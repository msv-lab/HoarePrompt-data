Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `ans` is the total sum of all elements in `tmp` where `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and equals 2 modulo 2, plus any additional increment of 1 if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2.
- `y` is the remaining value after subtracting `i - 1` from it as many times as possible within each iteration of the loop, or it remains unchanged if the loop breaks early.
- `ans` is incremented by `x + y - 2`.
- `ii` is `k + 1`.
- `tt` is the same as before.
- `tmp` is an empty list.

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i < len(a)`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be set to 1 initially.

2. **List `a`:**
   - The list `a` is already defined and sorted, so no adjustment is needed for this variable.

3. **Variable `ans`:**
   - The value of `ans` is determined by the conditions involving `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, but since the loop hasn't started yet, `ans` is not directly affected by the loop itself. However, the initial value of `ans` should be considered.

4. **Variable `y`:**
   - `y` is calculated based on the current value of `i` and its relationship with `ans`.
   - Since `i` is set to 1, `y` will be calculated based on `i = 1`.

5. **Variables `x` and `ii`:**
   - These variables are not mentioned in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

6. **Variable `tt`:**
   - This variable is not mentioned in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

7. **List `tmp`:**
   - The list `tmp` is empty, so no adjustment is needed for this variable.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the value of `i` to ensure the loop starts correctly.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1**
