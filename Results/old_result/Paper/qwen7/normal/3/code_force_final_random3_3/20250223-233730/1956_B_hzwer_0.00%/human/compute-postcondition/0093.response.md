Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is `n-3`; `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1` if `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, otherwise `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; the `cards` list also remains unchanged.
