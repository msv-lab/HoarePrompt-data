Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations; `max_sum` holds the highest value of `gcd_val + y` found during any iteration, `best_y` stores the value of `y` that resulted in the highest `current_sum`; `results` list is appended with `best_y`.**

The code appends the value of `best_y` to the `results` list. Since `results` was not mentioned to have any initial values, it is now a list containing `best_y`. All other variables (`x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`, `max_sum`, and `best_y`) retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
