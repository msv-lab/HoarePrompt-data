Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, the dictionary `d` will contain counts of each integer in the list `palka`, the list `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared, and the variable `w` remains greater than 0; `shapes` is 0.**

This means that the variable `shapes` has been initialized to 0, while the other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
