Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues if `(left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum)` holds true.
   - If the condition `(left * 2 >= lsum) and (right * 2 >= rsum)` holds true, then the loop continues based on the comparison involving `ans` and `i`.

3. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `left` is `S[i][0]`.
   - `lsum` is `i`.
   - `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`.
   - `rsum` is `n - i`.
   - The loop condition checks if `(left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum)`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - If the loop continues, `i` will increase by 1.
   - We need to check the new values of `left`, `lsum`, `right`, and `rsum` for `i = i + 1`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `left` will be `S[i][0]`.
   - `lsum` will be `i + 1`.
   - `right` will be `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`.
   - `rsum` will be `n - (i + 1)`.

6. **Ensure the loop condition is met**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `(left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum)` is true.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0; `left` is `S[i+1][0]`; `lsum` is `i + 1`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i+1][1]`; `rsum` is `n - (i + 1)`**.
