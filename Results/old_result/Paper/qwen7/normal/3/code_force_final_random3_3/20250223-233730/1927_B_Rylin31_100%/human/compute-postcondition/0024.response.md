Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the index `j` in the list `s` (which is a list of `l` zeros), `array` is a non-empty list of integers, `s` is a list of `l` zeros where the `j`-th element is now 1, `l` is an input integer, `j` is the first element of `array`**.

Explanation: The code `s[j] += 1` increments the `j`-th element of the list `s` by 1. Since `s` was initially a list of `l` zeros, incrementing the `j`-th element by 1 changes it to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
