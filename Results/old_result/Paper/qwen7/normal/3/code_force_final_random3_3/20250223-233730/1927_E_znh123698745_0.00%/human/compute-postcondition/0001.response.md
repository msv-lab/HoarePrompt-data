Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
