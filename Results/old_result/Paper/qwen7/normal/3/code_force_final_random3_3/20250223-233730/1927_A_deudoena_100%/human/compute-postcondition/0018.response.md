Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `j` which iterates over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `ma` is 0
   - `mi` is 2
   - `m` is an input integer
   - `s` is a non-empty string starting with 'B'
   - `c` is 2
   - `d` is 0
   - `l` is an empty list
   - `j` is the second character of `s`
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Determine the Next Character in the String**:
   - Since `j` is currently the second character of `s`, the next character in the string `s` will be the third character.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - `j` will now be the third character of `s`.
   - The loop will continue as long as there are more characters in `s` to iterate over.

5. **Final Adjusted State**:
   - `ma` remains 0
   - `mi` remains 2
   - `m` remains an input integer
   - `s` remains a non-empty string starting with 'B'
   - `c` remains 2
   - `d` remains 0
   - `l` remains an empty list
   - `j` is now the third character of `s`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`ma` is 0, `mi` is 2, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string starting with 'B', `c` is 2, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the third character of `s`**.
