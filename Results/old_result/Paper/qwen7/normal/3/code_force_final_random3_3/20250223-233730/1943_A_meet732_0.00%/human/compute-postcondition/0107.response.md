Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the value `n + 1`. The loop will iterate from `j = 1` to `j < n + 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: Since the loop starts with `j = 1`, the initial value of `j` should be set to 1.

3. **Determine the Value of `n`**: The loop will continue as long as `j < n + 1`. Therefore, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1) for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Check Other Variables**: The variables `cntl[0]` and `c` are not directly involved in the loop condition. However, they might affect the loop body, but since the problem asks to adjust only the states of objects in the loop head, we don't need to change their values.

Based on the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`cntl[0]` is the frequency of the integer 0 in the list `a`, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
