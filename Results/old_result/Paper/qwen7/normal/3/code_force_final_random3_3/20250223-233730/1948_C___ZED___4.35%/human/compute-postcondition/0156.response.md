Postcondition: **`i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `k` is `n-1`, `a` is a new string input by the user, `b` is the new input string, and `no_path` remains `False` unless `b[k]` is not `'>''` for any `k` in the range of the loop, and if `no_path` is `False`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `a[k]` is not `'>''.**
