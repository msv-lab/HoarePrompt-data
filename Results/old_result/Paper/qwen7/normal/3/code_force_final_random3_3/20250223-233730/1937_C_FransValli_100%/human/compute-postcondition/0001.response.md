Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state, which is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
