Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is an odd integer greater than 8, `ans` is increased by 4 times the value of `s[x]`, `x` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` increments `ans` by twice the value of `s[x]`. Since `x` is increased by 1 before this line, `x` is now one more than its previous value. However, the exact value of `s[x]` is not specified, so we express the updated value of `ans` as increased by 4 times the value of `s[x]` (since it was previously increased by 2 times the value). The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged.
