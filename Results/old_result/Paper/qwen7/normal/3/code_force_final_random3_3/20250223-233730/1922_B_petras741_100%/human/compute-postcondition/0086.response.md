Output State: The final state of `eta` will be a list containing all indices `j` from `range(n + 1)` for which `q[j] > 0`. The variable `j` will have the value `n` after the loop completes, assuming `n` is non-negative. If no elements in `q` satisfy `q[j] > 0`, then `eta` will remain an empty list `[]`.

In simpler terms, `eta` will contain all the indices from `0` to `n` (inclusive) where the corresponding elements in `q` are greater than 0.
