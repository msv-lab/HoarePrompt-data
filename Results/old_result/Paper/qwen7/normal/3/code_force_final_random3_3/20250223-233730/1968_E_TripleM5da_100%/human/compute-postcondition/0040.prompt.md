Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(1, 1)
    print(1, 2)
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        print(i, i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 6, `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be 6 (since the loop increments `i` starting from 3 up to `n`), and `n` must be at least 6 for the loop to complete all its iterations. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 12, `n` must be at least 9.

Explanation: The loop starts with `i` being 7 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration. After 3 iterations, `i` is 9. The loop continues until `i` reaches `n + 1`, so if the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time and starts from 3 (inclusive), the final value of `i` will be `n`. Given the initial condition that `i` is 7, after the loop completes, `i` will be `n`, and since the loop increments starting from 3, the smallest possible value for `n` is 9. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be 12 if the loop runs from 3 to 12 (inclusive).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be at least 13.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will increment to match the value of `n`. This is because the loop runs from `i = 3` to `i = n`, incrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `n`. Therefore, at the end of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n`, while `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
