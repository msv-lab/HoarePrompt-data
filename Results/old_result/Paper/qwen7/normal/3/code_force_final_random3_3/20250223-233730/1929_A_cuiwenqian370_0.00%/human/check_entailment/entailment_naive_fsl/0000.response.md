Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly rearrange the array to maximize the beauty as described. The logic in `func_1` does not ensure that the maximum and minimum values are placed at the appropriate positions to maximize the sum of differences. Specifically, the current approach alternates between the smallest and largest remaining elements, which does not guarantee the maximum possible beauty.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
10 5 1 20
```
The expected output should be 33 because we can rearrange the array to `[1, 20, 5, 10]`, resulting in a beauty of `(20-1) + (5-20) + (10-5) = 19 - 15 + 5 = 9`. However, the program's current logic would not achieve this maximum beauty.
