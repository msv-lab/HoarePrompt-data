Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is a value within the range [0, n - 1), `cnt` is 2 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, and `cnt` is 1 otherwise.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was previously 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, and 0 otherwise, after executing this line, `cnt` will be 2 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, and 1 otherwise. All other variables remain unchanged.
