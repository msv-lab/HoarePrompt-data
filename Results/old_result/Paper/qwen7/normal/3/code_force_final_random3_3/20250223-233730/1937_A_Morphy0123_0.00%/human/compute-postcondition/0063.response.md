Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer entered by the user, and `power` is set to 5 if `n == 15`, otherwise `power` is set to 4 if `n == 1`, or `power` is 4 and equals `n` if `n` is at least 16, or `power` is at least 3 and does not equal `n` if `n` is at least 16.
