Output State: **`n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is adjusted based on the condition, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `number` is either `Min` or `Max` depending on whether `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k` holds true; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The code subtracts `Min * Max` from `n`. The values of `k`, `Min`, `Max`, and `number` remain unchanged. The variable `tab` also remains unchanged. The only updated variable is `n`, which is now `n - Min * Max`.
