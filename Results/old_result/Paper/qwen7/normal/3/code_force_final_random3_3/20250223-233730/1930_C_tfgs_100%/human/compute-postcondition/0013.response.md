Output State: **`cur` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order where each element `a[j]` (where \(0 \leq j < n\)) is equal to \(n - j\), `counter` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `a` in descending order. Since `a[j]` is originally equal to `j + 1` for each `j` from `0` to `n-1`, after sorting, `a[j]` becomes `n - j` for each `j` from `0` to `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
