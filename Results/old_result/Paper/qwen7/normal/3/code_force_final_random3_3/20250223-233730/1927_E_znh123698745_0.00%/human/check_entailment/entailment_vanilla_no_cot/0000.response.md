Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly generate a k-level permutation. The logic used to construct the `answer` list does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. 

To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` in the generated permutation are as close as possible to each other. Here's a corrected approach:

```python
def generate_k_level_permutation(n, k):
    # Initialize the permutation with the sequence 1 to n
    perm = list(range(1, n + 1))
    
    # Adjust the permutation to make it k-level
    for i in range(k // 2):
        # Swap elements to balance the sums
        perm[i], perm[n - i - 1] = perm[n - i - 1], perm[i]
    
    return perm

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        perm = generate_k_level_permutation(n, k)
        print(*perm)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Initialization**: Start with a simple permutation `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
2. **Balancing Sums**: To ensure the sums of continuous segments of length `k` are balanced, swap the first half of the permutation with the second half. Specifically, swap elements at positions `0` and `n-1`, `1` and `n-2`, and so on up to `k//2` swaps.
3. **Output**: Print the resulting permutation.

This approach ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` will be as close as possible to each other, making the permutation k-level.
