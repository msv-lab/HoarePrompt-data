Output State: **`ans` is the character corresponding to the value of `s[j] + 98`, `j` is the second element of `array`, `array` is a non-empty list of integers.**

Explanation: The code `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` updates the value of `ans` by adding the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97 + 1` (which is `s[j] + 98`) to the current value of `ans`. The variable `j` remains the second element of `array`, and `array` remains a non-empty list of integers. The initial value of `ans` was the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97`, and now it is updated to the character corresponding to `s[j] + 98`.
