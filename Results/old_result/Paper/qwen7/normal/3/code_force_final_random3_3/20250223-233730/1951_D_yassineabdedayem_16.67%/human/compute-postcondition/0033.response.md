Output State: **`rep` is 2, `k` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `number` is `min(n // k, k)`**

Explanation: The line `number = Min` assigns the value of `Min` to `number`. Since `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)`, `number` now holds the same value as `Min`. All other variables (`rep`, `k`, and `Min`) remain unchanged.
