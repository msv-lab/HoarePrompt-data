You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, representing the number of cards you and Nene receive initially. The list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, representing the integers on the cards in your hand, and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list at most 2 times.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        
        idx += n
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a))
        
    #State: Output State: `data` remains unchanged, `idx` is `idx + 3 * n`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx-3*n:idx-2*n]` converted using `map(int, ...)`, `results` is a list with elements from each iteration of `func_1(n, a)` appended, totaling `t` elements.
    #
    #In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have completed:
    #- The `data` list remains unchanged throughout the process.
    #- The `idx` variable will have increased by `3 * n` (since it increments by `n` each iteration and the loop runs `t` times).
    #- The `a` list contains integers from the portion of `data` that corresponds to the last iteration's input.
    #- The `results` list contains the outputs of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration, resulting in a total of `t` elements in the `results` list.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `data` remains unchanged, `idx` is `idx + 3 * n`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx - 3 * n:idx - 2 * n]` converted using `map(int, ...)`, `results` is a list with `t` elements.
    #
    #In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have completed:
    #- The `data` list remains unchanged throughout the process.
    #- The `idx` variable will have increased by `3 * n` (since it increments by `n` each iteration and the loop runs `t` times).
    #- The `a` list contains integers from the portion of `data` that corresponds to the last iteration's input.
    #- The `results` list contains the outputs of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration, resulting in a total of `t` elements in the `results` list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes data through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, followed by integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a list a containing n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) with each integer appearing at most twice. For each test case, the function determines and returns whether it's possible to pair up all cards such that each pair consists of two cards with the same integer.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
