Output State: **`x` is the next element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reverse of `x`, `rev_res` is empty, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reverse of `x`**.

Explanation: The code `rev_val.append(x[::-1])` appends the reversed string of `x` to the list `rev_val`. The original values of `x`, `x_rev`, `rev_res`, and `rev_val` remain unchanged except that `rev_val` now contains the reversed string of `x`.
