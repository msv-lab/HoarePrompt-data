Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l` + (`h` - `l`) // 2, `h` is the index of the element in `D` that is strictly less than `right - f`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`, and `l` is updated to `mid + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to be `mid + 1`. All other variables retain their previous values.
