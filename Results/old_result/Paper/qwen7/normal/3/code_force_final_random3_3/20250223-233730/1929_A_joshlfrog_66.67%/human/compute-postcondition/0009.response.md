Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `e` is 0, `l` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `x` is the value of `nums[i]`, `y` is 100000000, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `x`. Since `nums[i]` is greater than 0, `x` now holds the value of `nums[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
