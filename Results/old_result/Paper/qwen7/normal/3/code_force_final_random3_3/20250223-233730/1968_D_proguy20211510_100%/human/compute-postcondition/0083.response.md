Output State: **`pres` is added to `paths[i] * (k - i)`, where `i` is 4, and `paths` length is greater than 4; `curr` is the result of `pres + paths[4] * (k - 4)`.**

In this scenario, `i` is explicitly given as 4, and the value of `paths` must have more than 4 elements. The variable `curr` is calculated as the sum of `pres` and the product of `paths[i]` (which is `paths[4]`) and the difference between `k` and `i` (which is `k - 4`). The conditions and values of `pres` and `k` remain unchanged from the initial state.
