Postcondition: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - i`, `ans` is either unchanged or updated to `i` if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`. If the condition `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` is true, `ans` remains unchanged or is updated based on the condition; otherwise, `ans` is updated to `i` if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is smaller than the current `ans`.
