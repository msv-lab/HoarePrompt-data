Output State: `results` is a list containing the total number of operations performed across all test cases, `i` is equal to the total number of test cases, `operations` is the sum of operations performed for each test case, and `heap` is empty.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `results` will contain the total number of operations performed across all test cases. The value of `i` will be equal to the total number of test cases since the loop runs for each test case exactly once. The variable `operations` will hold the sum of operations performed for each test case. Since the loop processes each test case and empties the heap at the end, the heap will be empty.
