You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of integers provided by the user, counting the occurrences of each unique integer. It then calculates the sum of one-fourth of the count for each unique integer and prints the result. The function does not return any value but modifies the internal state by processing the input list and using a dictionary to store counts.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where multiple polygons can be formed using different sets of sticks. Specifically, the program only considers the minimum number of sticks required to form a polygon (which is 3) and divides the count of each stick length by 4 to determine the number of polygons. This approach fails to consider scenarios where multiple polygons can be formed using different combinations of sticks.

For example, in the fourth test case provided:
```
9
4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4
```
The program would calculate the number of polygons as follows:
- There are 5 sticks of length 4, which can form 1 polygon (since 5 // 4 = 1).
- There are 6 sticks of length 2, which can form 1 polygon (since 6 // 4 = 1).

However, the correct solution should recognize that:
- 4 sticks of length 4 can form 1 polygon.
- 4 sticks of length 2 can form 1 polygon.
- 2 sticks of length 2 can form another polygon.

Thus, the correct answer should be 2 polygons, but the program incorrectly outputs 1.
