Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in tmp:`. Therefore, the only variables involved are `i` and `tmp`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i`: This variable will take on each value from the list `tmp` during the loop iterations.
   - `tmp`: This list is sorted and may contain specific elements based on the conditions given.

3. **Understand the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `tmp` is not empty. If `tmp` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop depends on `tmp` being non-empty, we need to ensure that `tmp` is not empty at the start of the loop.
   - The value of `i` will vary depending on the contents of `tmp`, but since the loop will iterate over all elements in `tmp`, we don't need to specify a particular value for `i` initially.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `tmp` must not be empty.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`tmp` must not be empty**
