The variables in the loop head are `left` and `right`, so we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `left <= right`. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is 1 and `right` is `n - 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `left <= right` must still hold true. Given that `left` is 1, `right` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `right` is at least 1.

State: **`left` is 1, `right` must be greater than or equal to 1**
