Postcondition: `palka` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the second element in the list `palka`, and `d[i]` is set to 1 if `i` did not exist in the dictionary `d` before the execution of the if-else block, or `d[i]` is increased by 1 if `i` already existed in the dictionary `d`.
