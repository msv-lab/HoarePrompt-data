Output State: **`a` is the next element in `arr`, `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x, `ry` is a % y, `count` is increased by freq[current_pair] + 1, `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y), `ry` is updated to a % y, `count` is either count + freq[(rx, ry)] if (rx, ry) is in freq, or just count + 1 if (rx, ry) is not in freq, `freq[current_pair]` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `freq[current_pair] = 1` sets the value of `freq[current_pair]` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
