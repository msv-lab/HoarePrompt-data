Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `j + 1`: This means that `j` has been incremented by 1.
- `n` is known: `n` has a specific value but it is not explicitly stated.
- `r` is known: `r` also has a specific value but it is not explicitly stated.
- `sum` is 0 if `j` is still less than or equal to `n`: Since `j` is `j + 1`, it implies that `j` was originally less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `sum` is currently 0.

The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The `*` operator is used to unpack the range into separate arguments for the `print` function.

Given this information, the output will be the numbers from 1 to `n` printed on a single line separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n**
