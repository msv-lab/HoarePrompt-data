Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This means `t` can take any integer value between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
- `n` must be at least 2. The value of `n` is not explicitly stated, but it is not relevant to the print statement.
- `i` is 3.
- `maxi` is 2.
- `res` is an input string, and it equals '<'.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

This will print the string `'?'` followed by the values of `maxi`, `maxi`, `i`, and `i`. Since `maxi` is 2 and `i` is 3, the output will be:
Output: **'? 2 2 3 3'**
