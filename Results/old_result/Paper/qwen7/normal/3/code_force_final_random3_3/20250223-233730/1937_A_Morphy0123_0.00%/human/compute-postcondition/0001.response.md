Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n_cases`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n_cases` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1. The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n_cases`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop will run for `n_cases` iterations, `i` should be 0 initially.
   - The loop will execute if `n_cases` is at least 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being 0 and `n_cases` being greater than or equal to 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than or equal to 1**
