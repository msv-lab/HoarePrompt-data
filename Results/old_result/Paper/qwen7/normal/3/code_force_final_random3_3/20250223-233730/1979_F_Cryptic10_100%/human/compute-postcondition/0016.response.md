Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n-2 excluding `v1`, `v1` is now `v2`, `v2` is the new second last element of `vx`, and `ops` is a list containing one tuple (`v2`, `v2`).**

Explanation: The code removes `v1` from the set `vx`. Since `v1` was the second last element of `vx`, removing it means that `v2` is now the second last element. The variable `ops` remains unchanged as it only contains a tuple of `(v1, v2)`, and after removing `v1`, `v1` is updated to `v2`.
