Output State: **`tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The initial values of `tt`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
