Output State: **`t` must be less than `n // 2`, `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is `s[x] * 2`, `x` is 1, `j` is less than `n // 2 - 1**.

Explanation: The code `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. Initially, `x` is 0, so after executing the code, `x` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
