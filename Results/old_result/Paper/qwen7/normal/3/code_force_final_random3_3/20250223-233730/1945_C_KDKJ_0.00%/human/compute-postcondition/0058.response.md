Output State: **`i` is 2, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1] + S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1] + S[1][0] + S[1][1] + S[2][0] + S[2][1])`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`**

Explanation: The code `rsum = n - lsum` updates the value of `rsum` to be `n - lsum`. The other variables (`i`, `left`, `lsum`, and `right`) remain unchanged. The updated value of `rsum` is calculated using the new expression `n - lsum`, where `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1] + S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, and `i` is 2.
