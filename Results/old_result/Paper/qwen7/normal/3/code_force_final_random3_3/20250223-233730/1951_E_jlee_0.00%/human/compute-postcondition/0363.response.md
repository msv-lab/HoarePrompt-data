Output State: **`done` is `True`, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is an index within the string such that `j + 1` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, and `count` is equal to `j`, and `string` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code `string = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `string`. The values of `done`, `i`, `j`, and `count` remain unchanged from their initial states.
