Based on the initial state provided:

- `pres` is the sum of `paths[4] * (k - 3)`, `paths[5]`, and `paths[6]`.
- `curr` is `pres + paths[6] * (k - 6)`.
- `ress` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr`.
- `i` is equal to the length of `paths`.
- `resb` is less than or equal to `ress`.
- The condition `ress > resb` is false.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('Draw')
```

Given that the print statement is directly printing a string without any variables or expressions, the output will be exactly as written in the print statement.

Output: **Draw**
