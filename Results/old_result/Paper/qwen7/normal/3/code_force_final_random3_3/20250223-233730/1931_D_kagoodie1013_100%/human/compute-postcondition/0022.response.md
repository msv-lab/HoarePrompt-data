Output State: `test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `count` is the cumulative sum of the values of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each iteration, `residue_map` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair encountered during the loop's execution, where `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x` and `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`, `current_key` is set to `num % x, num % y` for each iteration, and `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y` for each iteration.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `test_cases` remains unchanged, `results` remains an empty list, `count` holds the total occurrences of all `(r_x, r_y)` pairs seen throughout the loop, `residue_map` records how many times each specific `(r_x, r_y)` pair appears, `current_key` is the `(r_x, r_y)` pair for the current iteration, and `r_y` is the remainder when the current number `num` is divided by `y`.
