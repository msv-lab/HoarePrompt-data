Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is equal to `t`; `m` is the second integer input split from the same input line; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`; `k` is not a power of two and `k` is even; `l` is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix; `p` is the length of `l`; `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\); `f` is non-zero and has at least two bits set to 1; `p` is calculated as the length of `l`.**

Explanation: The code `p = len(l)` calculates the length of the string `l`, which is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix. The value of `p` is updated to this length, while all other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
