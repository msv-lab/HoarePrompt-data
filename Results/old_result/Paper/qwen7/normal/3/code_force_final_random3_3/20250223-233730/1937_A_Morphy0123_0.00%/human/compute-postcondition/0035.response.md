Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` must be greater than 15, `power` is 5.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `power` by 1 until it is no longer less than the value of `log2(n)`. After each iteration, `power` increases by 1. Given that `power` reaches 4 after 3 iterations, we can deduce that `log2(n)` was initially greater than or equal to 4 but less than 5. Therefore, `n` must be greater than \(2^4 = 16\) but less than \(2^5 = 32\). Since the loop will continue until `power` is no longer less than `log2(n)`, and `log2(n)` is now at most 4 (since `n` is just below 16), `power` will be incremented one more time to reach 5. Thus, `n` must be greater than \(2^4 = 16\), which simplifies to `n` being greater than 15 for the final state.
