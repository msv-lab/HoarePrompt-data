Output State: **`qs` must have at least one element, `n` is the first element in `qs`, `res` is a list with the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `res.append(func_1(n, p))` appends the result of the function call `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. The initial state indicates that `qs` has at least one element, `n` is the first element in `qs`, and `res` is a list with the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` already appended to it. After executing the code, `res` will have the same list with the additional value from the function call `func_1(n, p)` appended to it. The other variables remain unchanged.
