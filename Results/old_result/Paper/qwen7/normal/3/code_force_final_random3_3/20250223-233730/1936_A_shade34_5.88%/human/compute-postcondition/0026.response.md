Based on the initial state, `i` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the value of `n`, and `n` must be greater than 3. Since `n` must be greater than 3, `i` can only be 0, 1, or 2.

However, the values of `mak` and `mak2` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine their exact values. We will represent them as `mak` and `mak2`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Given the values:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `mak` and `mak2` are unspecified.
- `i` is either 0, 1, or 2.
- `mak2` is repeated at the end.

The output will include these components. Since `mak` and `mak2` are not defined, they will remain as `mak` and `mak2` in the output.

Output: **'? mak mak2 i mak2' (where i is 0, 1, or 2)**
