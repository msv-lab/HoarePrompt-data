Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the program checks if the number of yogurts \( n \) is odd or even.
3. If \( n \) is odd, the program compares the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price (\( a \times n \)) with the cost of buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price plus the remaining yogurt at the regular price (\( \frac{n}{2} \times b + a \)). It chooses the cheaper option.
4. If \( n \) is even, the program directly calculates the cost of buying all pairs at the promotion price (\( \frac{n}{2} \times b \)).
5. The logic in the program matches the problem statement accurately. It handles both odd and even values of \( n \) correctly and uses the appropriate pricing strategy to minimize the total cost.

Given that the program follows the logic described in the problem statement and the execution summary accurately reflects this logic, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
