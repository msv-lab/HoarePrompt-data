Output State: **`max_diff` is equal to `diff` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise `max_diff` remains `-inf`. `next_max_diff` is equal to `diff` if `diff > next_max_diff`, otherwise it remains unchanged. `index` is `i` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise it remains `None`. `diff` is updated to `A[i] - A[i - 1]`, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, and `A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` retain their original values from `func_4()`**.

This means that the value of `diff` is now updated to the difference between `A[i]` and `A[i - 1]`, and `i` is incremented by 1. The values of `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` may have been updated based on the new value of `diff`. The other variables (`A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F`) remain unchanged from their values in `func_4()`.
