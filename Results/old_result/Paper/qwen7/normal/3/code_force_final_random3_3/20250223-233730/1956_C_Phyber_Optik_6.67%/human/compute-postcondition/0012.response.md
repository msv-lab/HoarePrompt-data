Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. This means the loop will run `n` times.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sum` is either \(0 + n \times (n + 1) // 2\) or \(i \times n\), depending on whether the condition \(n \times (n + 1) // 2 > i \times n\) holds true.
   - `i` is either 1 or 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `r` is either 1 or 0.

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 each time, if `i` is 1, it will become 2 in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was 1, it will become 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should still be less than or equal to `n`.

6. **Consider the postconditions**:
   - The value of `sum` will depend on the new value of `i` and the condition \(n \times (n + 1) // 2 > i \times n\).
   - `r` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` becomes 2 (since it was 1 in the previous iteration and the loop increments `i` by 1).
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `r` remains either 1 or 0.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: **`sum` is either 0 + n * (n + 1) // 2 or 2 * n, depending on whether the condition n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n holds true. `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, and `r` is either 1 or 0.**
