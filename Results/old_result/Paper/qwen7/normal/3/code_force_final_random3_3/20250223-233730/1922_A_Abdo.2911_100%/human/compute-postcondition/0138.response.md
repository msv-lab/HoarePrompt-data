Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `b` are not equal, and `c[0]` is neither equal to `a[0]` nor `b[0]`; `possible` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the initial conditions are specified and no changes are made to these variables within the scope of the given code snippet, the only change is that we break out of the loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, the elements of lists `a` and `b`, and `c[0]` remain unchanged, and `possible` remains `True`.
