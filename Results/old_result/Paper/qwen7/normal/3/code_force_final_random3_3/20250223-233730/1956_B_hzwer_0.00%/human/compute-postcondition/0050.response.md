Output State: **`i` is either `n-5` or `n-4`, `j` is `0`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros except `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][j]`, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `cards` list remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to `dp[i + 1][j]`. Given that `j` is `0`, the only affected element in the `dp` list is `dp[i][0]`, which is now set to `dp[i + 1][0]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `t`, `n`, and the `cards` list remain unchanged.
