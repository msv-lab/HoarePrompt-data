Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer read from standard input and `n` is not zero, `k` is a positive integer read from standard input, `rep` is 1, `number` is either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `Min` and `Max` are reassigned to `min(n // k, k)` and `max(int(n / k), k)` respectively.**

This means that the values of `Min` and `Max` have been updated to reflect the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
