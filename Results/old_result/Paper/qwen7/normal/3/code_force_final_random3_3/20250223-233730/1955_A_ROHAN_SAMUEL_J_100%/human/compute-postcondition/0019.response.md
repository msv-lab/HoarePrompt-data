Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer. If `n` is odd, and 2 * `a` is less than `b`, then `b` remains unchanged. If `n` is odd and 2 * `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to 2 * `a`. If `n` is even, no change is made to `b`.
