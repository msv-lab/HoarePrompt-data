Output State: **`eta` is a list containing the integers `1`, `1`, and `3`; `q` is a list with elements updated according to the loop's execution; `j` is `3`.**

Explanation: The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` (which is `3`) to the list `eta`. The list `eta` initially contains the integers `1` and `1`. After appending `3`, `eta` now contains `1`, `1`, and `3`. The value of `j` remains unchanged at `3`. The list `q` and the variable `n` are not affected by this code.
