Output State: **`ans` is `i`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - i`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `ans`. All other variables (`n`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, `rsum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
