Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(mid)`. This means `i` will take values from `0` to `mid-1`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: Since `i` starts at `0`, no adjustment is needed for `i` itself.

3. **Determine the Value of `mid`**: The value of `mid` is given as `((right + 1) - (left + 1)) // 2`. For the loop to execute, `mid` must be greater than `0`.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `mid` is greater than `0`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `mid` is indeed greater than `0`.

5. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `mid` is greater than `0`. Given the formula for `mid`, we need to check if the expression `((right + 1) - (left + 1)) // 2` results in a positive number.

6. **Initial Values**: The initial values of `left`, `right`, and the other variables (`clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `not_mid`) do not directly affect the loop's execution based on the provided information.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `mid` must be greater than `0`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`mid` must be greater than 0**
