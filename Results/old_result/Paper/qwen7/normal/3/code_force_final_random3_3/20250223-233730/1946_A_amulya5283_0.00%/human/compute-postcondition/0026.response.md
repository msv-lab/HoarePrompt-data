Output State: **`results` is [number of elements in `heap`], `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `heap` + 1, `operations` is equal to the number of elements in `heap`, and `heap` is empty; `arr` is the sorted version of the second element of `test_cases[i]`.**

Explanation: The code sorts the array `arr`, which is the second element of `test_cases[i]`. Since `heap` is empty and does not get modified, its state remains unchanged. The values of `results`, `i`, and `operations` also remain unchanged. After sorting, `arr` now contains its elements in ascending order.
