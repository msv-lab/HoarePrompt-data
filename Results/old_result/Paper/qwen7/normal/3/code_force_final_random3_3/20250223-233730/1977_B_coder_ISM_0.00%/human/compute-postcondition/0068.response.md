Output State: **`i` is 2, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[0]` is either '0' or '1', `s[1]` is equal to `s[0]`, `s[2]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s[i] = '0'` changes the value of `s[2]` from '1' to '0' since `i` is 2. The values of `i`, `flag`, `s[0]`, `s[1]`, and the relationship between `s[0]` and `s[1]` remain unchanged.
