Output: **nx (where nx is a string of length n-1 consisting of 'S', 'F', or '?')**

Explanation:
- `i` is given as 1.
- `j` is given as `n`.
- `n` is at least 2, so `j` is also at least 2.
- `nx` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of characters 'S', 'F', or '?'.
- `xx[1][0]` remains unchanged and stays as '?'.

Since the `print(nx)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `nx`, which is a string of length `n-1` consisting of 'S', 'F', or '?'. The exact content of `nx` is not specified further in the initial state, so we describe it in terms of its known characteristics.
