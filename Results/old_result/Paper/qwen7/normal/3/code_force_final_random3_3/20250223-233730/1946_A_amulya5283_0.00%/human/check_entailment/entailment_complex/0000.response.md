Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input from standard input and splits it into test cases. This part is handled well and ensures that the input is processed correctly.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over each test case, sorts the array, and calculates the median index.
   - It then initializes a min-heap with the elements from the median index onwards.
   - The function uses a while loop to increment the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median.
   - The number of operations required to achieve this is counted and stored in the `results` list.

3. **Heap Operations**:
   - The use of a min-heap (`heapq`) to find and increment the smallest element is correct and efficient.
   - The logic to increment elements until the smallest element in the second half is greater than the median is sound.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the array has an even number of elements correctly by considering the median index as `n // 2`.
   - The program also handles the case where the array has a single element, which is a special case but is handled appropriately.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the list of operations required for each test case, which is correct according to the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
