### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. This means we want to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements.
   - It then calls a function `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty of the array.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function sorts the array `arr`.
   - It creates a new array `new_arr` where the smallest and largest elements are alternated to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.
   - Finally, it calculates the beauty of the new array by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array ensures that the smallest and largest values are placed at the extremes, which is a good start.
   - **Alternating Smallest and Largest Values**: The logic of alternating the smallest and largest values is intended to maximize the differences. However, the implementation has a flaw. Specifically, the loop that alternates the elements does not correctly alternate between the smallest and largest remaining elements. Instead, it alternates between the current `left` and `right` pointers, which do not necessarily correspond to the smallest and largest elements in the sorted array.
   - **Summing Absolute Differences**: The calculation of the beauty is correct once the array is properly constructed.

Let's examine the annotated code more closely:

```python
def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        
        left += 1
        
        right -= 1
        
    # State: Output State: `left` is `n - 1`, `right` is 1, and `new_arr` is a list containing all elements from `arr` but in reverse order.
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
    
    # State: Output State: `max_beauty` is increased by the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements from index 1 to `left + 1` in the `new_arr` list, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is equal to `left + 1`, and the values of `left`, `right`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged.
    return max_beauty
```

The issue lies in the loop that constructs `new_arr`. The loop alternates between `arr[right]` and `arr[left]`, but it does not ensure that the smallest and largest elements are alternated correctly. For example, if the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the resulting `new_arr` would be `[5, 1, 4, 2]`, which is not the optimal arrangement to maximize the beauty.

To fix this, we should construct `new_arr` by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements in the sorted array. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
        
        left += 1
        
        right -= 1
    
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
    
    return max_beauty
```

This corrected version ensures that the smallest and largest elements are alternated correctly, leading to the maximum possible beauty.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the corrected understanding and the provided annotations, the original assessment was inaccurate due to the flawed construction of the `new_arr` array.

**Final: False**
