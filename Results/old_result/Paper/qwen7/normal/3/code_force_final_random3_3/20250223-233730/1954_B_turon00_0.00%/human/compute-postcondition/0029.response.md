Output State: **`i` is 2; `cnt` is 1**

The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which was 0 before the increment). Since `i` must be greater than 1 and there is no indication that `i` changes, we keep that condition as well. Therefore, `i` is 2 and `cnt` is 1.
