Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is `True`, and `count` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `j`, `n`, `done`, and `count`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are currently inside. Since no other operations are performed, these variables retain their initial states.
