Functionality: **The function `make_array` takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It fills an array `arr` and another array `cliquess` within the specified range `[left, right]` with specific values. Specifically, it sets the first half of the range to values starting from `small_element` (which is `left + 1`) and incrementing by 1, and assigns the `clique` identifier to the corresponding indices in `cliquess`. The second half of the range is filled with values starting from `big_element` (which is `right + 1`) and decrementing by 1, also assigning the `clique` identifier to the corresponding indices in `cliquess`. The function does not return anything explicitly, but modifies the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays in place.**
