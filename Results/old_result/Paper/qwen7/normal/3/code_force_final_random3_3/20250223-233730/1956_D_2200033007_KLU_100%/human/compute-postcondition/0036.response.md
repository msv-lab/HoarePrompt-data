Output State: **`j` is 2, `i` is 1, `start_index` is 0, `arr[2]` is 1, `arr[2]` is now 1**

Explanation: The code `arr[j] = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to the index `j` (which is 2) in the array `arr`. Therefore, `arr[2]` changes from its initial value of 1 to 1 again, but the statement is included to show the update in the array. The values of `j`, `i`, `start_index`, and the value at `arr[2]` are updated accordingly.
