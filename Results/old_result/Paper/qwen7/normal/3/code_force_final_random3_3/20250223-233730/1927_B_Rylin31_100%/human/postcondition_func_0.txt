The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) indicating the number of subsequent test cases, then reads another integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) non-negative integers. It constructs a string `ans` by converting the values of `s[j] + 97` to characters from the alphabet ('a' to 'z'), where `s[j]` is incremented by the count of how many times `j` appears in the list. After processing all test cases, it prints the constructed strings `ans` for each case.
