Output State: **`i` is 1, `flag` is a boolean, `s` is a string where the character at index 1 is '1'**.

Explanation: The code snippet `s[i] = '1'` changes the character at index `i` (which is 1) of the string `s` to '1'. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1, and the value of `flag` also remains unchanged as it is a boolean that does not get affected by this assignment.
