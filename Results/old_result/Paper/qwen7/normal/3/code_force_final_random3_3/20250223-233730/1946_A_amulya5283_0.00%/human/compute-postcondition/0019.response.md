Output State: **`smallest` is now the new value of the smallest element in `heap` + 1; `smallest` is `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)`; `results` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `operations` is 2.**

Explanation: The code pushes the value of `smallest + 1` back into the heap using `heapq.heappush`. Since `smallest` was previously the smallest element in the heap, after pushing `smallest + 1`, the new value of `smallest` is updated to reflect the new smallest element in the heap, which is `smallest + 1`. The other variables (`results`, `i`, and `operations`) remain unchanged.
