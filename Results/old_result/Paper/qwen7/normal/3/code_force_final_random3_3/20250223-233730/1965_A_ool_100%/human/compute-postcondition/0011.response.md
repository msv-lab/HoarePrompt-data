Output State: **`A` is False, `not_c` is False, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and the current value of `set_[i] - set_[i - 1]` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The variable `not_c` was originally `True` and has now been explicitly set to `False`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
