Output State: **`cnt` is -1, `i` is 2, `x` is `n - 1`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is squared and then decreased by `i`. So, `i * i - i` equals `1 * 1 - 1` which is `0`. Therefore, `x` is calculated as `n - 0`, which simplifies to `n`. The variables `cnt` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
