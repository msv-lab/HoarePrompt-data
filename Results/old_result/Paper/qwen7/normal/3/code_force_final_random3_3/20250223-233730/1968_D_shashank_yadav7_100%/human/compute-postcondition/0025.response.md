Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is `p[s]` - 1, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is `sp` + `a[s]`, `bp` is `bp` + `a[b]`, `k` is `k - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or conditional block it is inside. Since no variables are reassigned or modified within the `break` statement itself, their previous values remain unchanged.
