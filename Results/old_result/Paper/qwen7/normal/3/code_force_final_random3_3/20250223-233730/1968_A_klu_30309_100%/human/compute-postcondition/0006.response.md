Output State: **`max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` must be greater than 1, `y` is `x-1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`**.

Explanation: The code assigns `current_sum` the value of `gcd_val + y`. Given that `y` is `x-1`, and `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, the value of `current_sum` is specifically `gcd_val + (x-1)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
