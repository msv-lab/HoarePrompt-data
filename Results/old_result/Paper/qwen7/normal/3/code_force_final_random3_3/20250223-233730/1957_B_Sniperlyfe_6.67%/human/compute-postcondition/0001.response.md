Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`, and the range function which uses `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
   - `nums` is a list of `n` zeros.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be initialized to 0 (the starting point of the range function).
   - `n` must be a positive integer (since the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`).

Given this, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to:
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be a positive integer (since the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`).

The final state to ensure the loop can execute is:
**`i` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer**.

So, the answer is:
**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer**.
