Output State: **`rev_val` is either an empty list or a list containing the reversed string of `x` (`'x_reversed'`), `rev_res` is either the original string `x` or an empty string, `list_len` is the length of the input string, `max_power` is the maximum power of the input string, `operational_list` is a list created from the split input and now has one less element, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`, `x_rev` is calculated as `int(x[::-1])`, `rev_val` now contains the reversed string of `x`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_val.append(x[::-1])` appends the reversed string of `x` to the list `rev_val`. Since `x[::-1]` reverses the string `x`, `rev_val` now includes this reversed string. All other variables remain unchanged.
