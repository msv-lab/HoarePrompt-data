Output State: **`lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list containing the value 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr.append(1)` appends the value 1 to the list `arr`. Given the initial state, if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` already contains the value 1. If `lex` is between 26 and 51, `arr` remains unchanged and still contains the element 26. However, since the code appends 1 to `arr`, regardless of the initial value of `lex`, `arr` will now contain the value 1. The value of `lex` itself is not affected by this operation.
