Output State: **`A` is False, `not_c` is False, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The variable `A` is initially `True`, and the code `A = not A` changes its value to `False`. The other variables (`not_c`, `set_`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
