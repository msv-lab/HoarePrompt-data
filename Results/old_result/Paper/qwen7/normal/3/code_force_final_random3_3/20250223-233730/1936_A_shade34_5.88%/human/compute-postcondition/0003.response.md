State: **`mak` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. The loop condition `range(1, n)` means that the loop will start with `i = 1` and continue as long as `i < n`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `i` starts from 1).
4. The initial value of `mak` being 0 does not affect the loop's execution condition, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` set to 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.
