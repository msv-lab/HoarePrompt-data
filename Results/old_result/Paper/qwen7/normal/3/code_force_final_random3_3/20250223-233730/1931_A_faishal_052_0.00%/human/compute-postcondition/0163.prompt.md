You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        
        lex = int(input())
        
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        
        arr.append(lex)
        
        arr.sort()
        
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, printing 'a' three times for each of the `cases` iterations.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `k` will be set to 2 (since the loop runs from 0 to 2, inclusive). The list `arr` remains unchanged as [1, 13, 26] because the loop body does not modify it. For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop prints the characters corresponding to the values in `arr` plus 96, which results in 'a', 'm', and 'z' being printed in sequence. However, since the question specifies that the output is 'a' three times, it implies that the values in `arr` are all 1 after the loop completes, leading to 'a' being printed three times for each case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on predefined constraints where t is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and for each test case, n is an integer between 3 and 78.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
