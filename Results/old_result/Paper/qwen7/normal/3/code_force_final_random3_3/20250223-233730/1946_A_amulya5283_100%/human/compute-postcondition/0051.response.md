Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` must still be greater than `mdx`, and `res` will be the count of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]` from index `mdx` to index `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value of `n`, indicating that the loop has checked every element from `mdx` to `n-1`. The variable `res` will hold the total count of elements in the list `a` that are equal to the element at index `mdx`.
