Output State: **`ans` is set to Decimal('Infinity'), `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains as the original input integer, `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, and `flag` remains False.**

This means that the variable `ans` is now set to `Decimal('Infinity')`, while the values of `i`, `n`, the relationship between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]`, and the value of `flag` remain unchanged from their initial states.
