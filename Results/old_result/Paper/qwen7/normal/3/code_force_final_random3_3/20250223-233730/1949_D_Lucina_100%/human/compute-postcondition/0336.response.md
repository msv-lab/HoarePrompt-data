Postcondition: `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `nx` is either 'SS' or 'SF', and `xx[1][1]` remains unchanged and stays as '?'.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `i` and `j` remain unchanged as 1 and 2 respectively, `n` stays at least 2, `nx` can be either 'SS' or 'SF', and the value of `xx[1][1]` remains unchanged and stays as '?'.
