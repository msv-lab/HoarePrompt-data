Output State: **`A` is False, `not_c` is False, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `A`, `not_c`, `set_`, or `i`. It only indicates that the execution will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such context is provided, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The condition `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1` remains true, so the list `set_` and the index `i` remain unchanged.
