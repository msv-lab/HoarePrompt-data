Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the original value of `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `s` is a string input by the user.
   - `pans` is a list containing the value of `i` if `s` is '<' or '='. Otherwise, `pans` remains unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is one of the values 0, 1, or 2 (depending on the original value of `n`).
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the start of the current iteration.
   - `s` and `pans` are not part of the loop head and thus their values remain unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value (0, 1, or 2), so the new value of `i` will be 1, 2, or 3.
   - `n` remains greater than 3.
   - `s` and `pans` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, 2, or 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `s` is a string input by the user, `pans` is a list containing the value of `i` if `s` is '<' or '='. Otherwise, `pans` remains unchanged.**
