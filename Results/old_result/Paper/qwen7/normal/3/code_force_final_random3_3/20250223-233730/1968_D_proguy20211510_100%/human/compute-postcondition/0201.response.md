Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`; `curr` is `pres + paths[i_end + 1] * (k - (i_end + 1))`; `pres` is `pres + paths[i_end + 1]`**.

Explanation: The line `pres += paths[i]` increments the value of `pres` by `paths[i]`. Here, `i` is equal to `i_end + 1`, so `pres` is updated to `pres + paths[i_end + 1]`. The values of `i`, `curr`, and `paths[i_end + 1]` remain unchanged. Therefore, `curr` remains as `pres + paths[i_end + 1] * (k - (i_end + 1))`.
