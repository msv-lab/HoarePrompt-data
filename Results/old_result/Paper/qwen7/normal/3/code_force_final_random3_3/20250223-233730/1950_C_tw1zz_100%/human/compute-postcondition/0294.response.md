Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of the input split by ':', `m` is the minute part of the input split by ':', `h1` is either '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', or '15', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM', and the input integer is decremented by 1, `h` and `m` are assigned the values from the input string split by ':'**

Explanation: The code `h, m = map(str, input().split(':'))` takes an input string in the format "hh:mm", splits it by the colon `:`, and converts both parts to strings. It then assigns the first part to `h` and the second part to `m`. The other variables remain unchanged. Additionally, the input integer is decremented by 1, but since no variable is explicitly assigned this value, we only note that the input integer is decremented by 1.
