Output State: **`not_mid` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `arr[left + mid + 2]` is `big_element - 2`**

Explanation: The code updates the element at the index `left + mid + i` in the array `arr` to the value `big_element - i`. Given that `i` is 2, the updated index is `left + mid + 2`, and the value at this index is set to `big_element - 2`. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.
