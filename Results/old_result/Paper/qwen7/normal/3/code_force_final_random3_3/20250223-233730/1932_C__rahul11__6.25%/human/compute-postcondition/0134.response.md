Output State: **`c` is increased by 1, `ans` and `res[c]` are integers. If the character at index `k` in the string `s` is 'L', then `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, and `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`, where `l` is increased by 1. If the character at index `k` in the string `s` is not 'L', then `res[c]` remains as `ans % m % MOD`, and `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r-1] % MOD`.**

Explanation: The code `c += 1` simply increments the value of `c` by 1. No other changes are made to the values of `ans` or `res[c]`. The conditions for updating `ans` and `res[c]` based on the character at index `k` in the string `s` remain unchanged.
