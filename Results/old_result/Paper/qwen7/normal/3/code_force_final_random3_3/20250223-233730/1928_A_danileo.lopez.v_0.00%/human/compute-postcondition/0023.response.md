Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, and the values of `a` and `b` will be the last integers entered by the user during the final iteration of the loop. No changes are made to `a` and `b` inside the loop based on the conditions given.**

This means that `t` will eventually reach 0 as the loop iterates `t` times, decrementing `t` each time through the loop. The values of `a` and `b` will be the ones provided in the last set of inputs since they are redefined with each iteration but not altered within the loop body based on the given conditions.
