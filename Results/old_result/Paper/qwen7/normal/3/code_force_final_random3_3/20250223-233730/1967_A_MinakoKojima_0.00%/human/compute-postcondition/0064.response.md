Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the next positive integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is either the factorial of `n` or the cumulative product of the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a` starting from index 1 up to `n-1`, depending on whether `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, and `i` is equal to `n`.**

The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. These values replace the placeholders for `n` and `k` in the initial state. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `m`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
