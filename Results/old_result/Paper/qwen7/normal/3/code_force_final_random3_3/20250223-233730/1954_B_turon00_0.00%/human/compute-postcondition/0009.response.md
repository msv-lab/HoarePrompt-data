Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the elements of the list `a`. If the set `aa` contains only one unique element, then the postcondition remains as described in the if part. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the condition.
