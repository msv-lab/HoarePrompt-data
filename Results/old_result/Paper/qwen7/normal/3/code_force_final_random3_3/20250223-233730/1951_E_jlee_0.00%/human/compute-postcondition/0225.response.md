Output State: **`s` is a string, `j` is such that the character at index `j` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`, `done` is True.**

Explanation: The variable `done` is assigned the value `True`. The values of `s` and `j` remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition about `j` (that the character at index `j` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`) also remains valid.
