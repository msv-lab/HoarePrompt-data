Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

# Annotated Program:
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the following list contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a dictionary with multiple key-value pairs where each key is an element from the original list `a` and each value is the count of occurrences of that element in the original list `a`.
    #
    #This final state occurs because the loop iterates over each element in the list `a`, updating the `cnt` dictionary to keep track of how many times each element appears. After all elements have been processed, the list `a` becomes empty, and `cnt` contains the counts of each unique element from the original list.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: `ans` is the sum of `x // 4` for all values `x` in `cnt`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a dictionary with the counts of each unique element from the original list `a`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of integers provided by the user, counting the occurrences of each unique integer. It then calculates the sum of one-fourth of the count for each unique integer and prints the result. The function does not return any value but modifies the internal state by processing the input list and using a dictionary to store counts.
