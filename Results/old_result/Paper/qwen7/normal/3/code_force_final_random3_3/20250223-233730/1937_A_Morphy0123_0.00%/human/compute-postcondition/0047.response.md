Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer entered by the user, `power` is 1.**

The code sets `power` to 1, overriding its previous value which was determined based on whether `n` was 15. Since no new value for `n` was provided, `n` remains as the integer entered by the user. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
