Output State: **`rank` is the rank part of the next `card`; `suit` is the suit part of the next `card`; `trump` remains the suit part of the next `card`; `trumps` is the list with the `rank` appended to it; `suits[suit]` is updated as per the previous iterations.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `rank` to the list `trumps`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `trumps` now includes the new value of `rank`.
