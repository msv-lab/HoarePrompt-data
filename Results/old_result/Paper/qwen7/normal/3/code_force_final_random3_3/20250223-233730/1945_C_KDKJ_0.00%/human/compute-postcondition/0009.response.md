Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer input specifying the number of times to call `func_1()`, then calls `func_1()` that many times. After the loop completes, the state of the program includes an integer `n` (initially between 3 and 300000) and a binary string `a` of length `n`, with `func_1()` having been called the number of times specified by the input.**
