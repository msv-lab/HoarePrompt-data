Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes data through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, followed by integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a list a containing n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) with each integer appearing at most twice. For each test case, the function determines and returns whether it's possible to pair up all cards such that each pair consists of two cards with the same integer.**

This means the function will go through multiple test cases, each with a specified number of cards, and check if it's possible to pair all cards so that each pair has the same integer on both cards.
