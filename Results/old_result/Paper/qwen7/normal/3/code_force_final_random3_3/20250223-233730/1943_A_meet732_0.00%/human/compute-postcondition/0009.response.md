Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer that must have at least one element, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 1, `i` is the next element in the list `a`, `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.**

In more detail, the value of `cntl[i]` is increased by 1, meaning that the count at index `i` in the `cntl` list is now one more than its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
