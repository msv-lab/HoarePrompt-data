### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves multiple piles of stones.
   - Players take turns removing a positive integer \(k\) (where \(k \leq\) the size of the smallest nonempty pile) from each nonempty pile simultaneously.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., all piles are empty) loses.
   - Alice starts the game.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The game can be analyzed using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of the sizes of the piles).
   - If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is zero, the player whose turn it is will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

3. **Analysis of Provided Functions**:
   - `func_1` sorts the unique values in the list and computes differences between consecutive elements. This function does not seem relevant to solving the game logic.
   - `func_2` is intended to determine the winner but has several issues:
     - It only handles cases for 1 and 2 piles correctly.
     - For more than 2 piles, it recursively calls itself with a reduced list, but this does not account for the correct Nim-sum logic.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Compute the Nim-sum of the pile sizes.
   - If the Nim-sum is zero, the current player (Bob) will win if both play optimally.
   - Otherwise, the current player (Alice) will win.

5. **Implementation**:
   - Use the XOR operation to compute the Nim-sum.
   - Determine the winner based on the Nim-sum.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions do not correctly implement the game logic. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
