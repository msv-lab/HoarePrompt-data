Output State: **`x` is the next element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reverse of `x`, `rev_res` contains `x`, `rev_val` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res = rev_res + x` appends the value of `x` to the list `rev_res`. Since `rev_res` was initially an empty list, after this operation, it now contains the value of `x`. The values of `x`, `x_rev`, and `rev_val` remain unchanged from their initial states.
