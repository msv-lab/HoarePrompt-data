Output State: **The program does not return any value**

Explanation: The provided code snippet simply contains a `return` statement without any value or expression. In Python, if a function does not explicitly return a value, it returns `None` by default. However, since the question format asks to state the output directly without mentioning `None`, we can conclude that the program does not return any value.
