Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `l < h`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`
   - `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`
   - If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `h` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `right - f[0]` - 1 and `h` is not equal to `l`.
   - Otherwise, `h` is `mid`.

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head variables are `l` and `h`.

4. **Analyze the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `l` must be less than `h`.
   - We need to ensure that the condition `l < h` holds true for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `h` is determined based on the comparison between `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum`, we need to ensure that the value of `h` does not change such that `l` remains less than `h`.
   - The values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` do not directly affect the loop condition `l < h`, but they determine the value of `h`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that the value of `h` does not become less than or equal to `l`.

Given the current states and the loop condition, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `l` and `h`. However, since the loop condition `l < h` must hold, we need to ensure that `h` does not become less than or equal to `l`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `right - f[0]` - 1 and `h` is not equal to `l`, and `l` must be less than `h`**.
