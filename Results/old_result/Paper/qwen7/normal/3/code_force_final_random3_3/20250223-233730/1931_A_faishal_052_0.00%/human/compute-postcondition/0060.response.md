Output State: **`k` is 2, `arr` is [1], `lex` is an input integer less than or equal to 25, `j` must be between 0 and 1 inclusive**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 1, so `lex` is now `lex - 1`. Since `lex` was initially an input integer less than or equal to 26, after decrementing by 1, it is now an input integer less than or equal to 25. All other variables remain unchanged.
