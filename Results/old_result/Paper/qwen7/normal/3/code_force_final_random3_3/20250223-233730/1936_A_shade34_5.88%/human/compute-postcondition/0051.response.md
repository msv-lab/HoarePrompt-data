Output State: **`i` is 2, 3, or 4; `n` must be greater than 3; `s` is the same as at the end of the previous iteration; if `s` is '<', `pans` contains `[i-1]` and `mak` is equal to `i-1`; otherwise, `pans` remains unchanged and `s` is the new input string from the user.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or change their values. It only ensures that all previously written output is actually sent to the user. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
