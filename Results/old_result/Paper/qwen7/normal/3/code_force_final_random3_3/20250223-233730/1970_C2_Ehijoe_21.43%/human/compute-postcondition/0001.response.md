Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, and `nodes` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree where each key is a node and its value is a list of its neighbors.**

The code `edges = []` initializes `edges` as an empty list. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `start`, or `nodes`. Therefore, their previous values remain unchanged.
