Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` (if '1' is present) or -1 if '1' is not found.**

The code `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` reverses the string `arr` and finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' from the end of the string. If '1' is not found, it returns -1. This does not affect the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, or `x`.
