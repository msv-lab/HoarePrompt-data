Output State: **`i` is `k + 2`; `n` must be greater than `k`; `s` is a string input by the user; `pans` is a list with the value `i`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is `k + 2`) to the list `pans`. No other changes are made to the variables `n` or `s`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `pans` with the appended value of `i`.
