Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `eta` is a list containing the integer `j`.
   - `q` is a list with elements updated according to the loop's execution.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Since `j` is currently 0, the loop will continue as long as `n` is greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 (from 0 to 1).
   - `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise, but it must still be a non-negative integer.

6. **Update the state**:
   - `eta` will now contain the integer `j`, which will be 1.
   - `q` remains unchanged as no information is given about its update in the next iteration.
   - `j` is now 1.
   - `n` remains a non-negative integer.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `eta` is a list containing the integer 1, `q` is a list with elements updated according to the loop's execution, `j` is 1, and `n` is a non-negative integer.**
