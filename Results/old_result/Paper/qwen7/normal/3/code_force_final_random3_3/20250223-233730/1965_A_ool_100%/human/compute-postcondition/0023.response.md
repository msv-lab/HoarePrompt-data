Output State: **`A` is False, `not_c` is False, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 3**.

The code `not_c = False` does not affect any other variables and only updates the value of `not_c` to `False`. Therefore, the values of `A`, `set_`, and `i` remain unchanged.
