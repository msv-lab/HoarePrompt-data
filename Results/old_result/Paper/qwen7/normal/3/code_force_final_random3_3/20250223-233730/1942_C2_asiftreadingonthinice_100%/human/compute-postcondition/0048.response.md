Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`; `ans` is the sum of all increments made to it during the loop plus `i`; `tmp` is a non-empty list containing all the values added to it whenever `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and equals to 2 modulo 2; `y` is equal to `i - (i - 1)` which simplifies to 1.**

This means that `y` has been decremented by `i - 1`, resulting in `y` being equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
