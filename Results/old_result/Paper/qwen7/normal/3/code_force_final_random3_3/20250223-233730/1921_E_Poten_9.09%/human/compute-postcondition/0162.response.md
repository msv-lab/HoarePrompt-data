Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `i` was set to 1. After appending `'Alice'` to `answers`, `i` is incremented by 1 (though the increment is not shown in the given code snippet, it is implied by the initial state that `i` starts at 1 and would be 2 after the append operation). The other variables (`test_cases` and `clues`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
