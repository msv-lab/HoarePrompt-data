Output State: **`tree` now contains the current element `curr` and `curr` is not equal to `e`, and `tree` has one more element `curr`.**

Explanation: The code `tree.append(curr)` adds the current element `curr` to the list `tree`. Since `curr` must not be equal to `e`, this condition is preserved. The variable `curr` remains unchanged but is now part of the list `tree`, which now includes all its previous elements plus `curr`.
