Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by identifying the positions where the elements in the array `nums` change and then checking these positions for each query to determine if there are different elements within the queried subarray.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic and steps taken in the program:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`). For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`N`), the array itself (`nums`), and the number of queries (`q`).

2. **Identifying Changes**: The program constructs a list `arr` that captures the positions where the elements in `nums` change. Each tuple in `arr` represents the start and end indices of segments where the elements are the same, along with the value of those elements.

3. **Handling Queries**: For each query defined by `l` and `r`, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment in `arr` that starts before or at position `l`. It then checks if the identified segment is within the query bounds. If so, it prints the indices of the first and second elements of that segment as the result. If no such segment exists, it prints `-1 -1`.

Given the problem statement and the provided annotated program, the logic appears to correctly identify the required pairs of indices for each query. The program correctly handles edge cases and ensures that the output matches the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
