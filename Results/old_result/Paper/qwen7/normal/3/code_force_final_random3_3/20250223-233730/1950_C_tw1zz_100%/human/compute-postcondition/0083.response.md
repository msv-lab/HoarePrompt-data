Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of `s`, `m` is the minute part of `s`, `h1` is '02', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string, and `h` is equal to '14'.**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `h1` to '02'. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
