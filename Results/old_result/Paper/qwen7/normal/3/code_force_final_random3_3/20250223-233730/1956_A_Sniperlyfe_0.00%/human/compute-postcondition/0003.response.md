Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, and then converts each string in the list to an integer. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `p`. The values of `t`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged from their initial state.
