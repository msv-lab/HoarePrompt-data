Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces, `clues[2]` is not even, `clues[4]` is not even, `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to `clues[5]`, and `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, and either `clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` is true.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. All other conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
