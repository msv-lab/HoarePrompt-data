Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `rev_val` is a sorted list of the reversed strings from the original `operational_list`, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the length of the input string, `max_power` is the maximum power of the input string, `operational_list` is an empty list after all elements have been processed, and `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x` for the current iteration.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `len(rev_val)` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0. If `x % 2 == 0`, then `rev_res` is a string containing the string representation of `val_in`, where `val_in` is an integer from `rev_val[0]`. If `x % 2 != 0`, then `rev_res` is equal to `val_in[::-1]`, where `val_in` is equal to `rev_val[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `len(rev_val)` must be greater than 0, `x` is 1, and `rev_res` is `rev_res` concatenated with either the string representation of `val_in` or the reverse of `val_in`, where `val_in` is `rev_val[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `len(rev_val)` must be greater than 0, `x` is 2, `rev_res` is `rev_res` concatenated with either the string representation of `int(rev_val[2])` (if `x % 2 == 0`) or the reverse of `rev_val[2]` (if `x % 2 != 0`), and `val_in` is `rev_val[2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
