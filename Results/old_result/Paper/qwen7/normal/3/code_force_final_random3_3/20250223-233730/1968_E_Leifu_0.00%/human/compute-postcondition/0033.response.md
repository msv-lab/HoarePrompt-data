Output State: `n` must be at least 9.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `j` starting from 4 up to `n`. After 3 iterations, `j` is `n + 1`, meaning `n` must be at least 5. For each additional iteration, `j` increases by 1. Therefore, after all iterations, if the loop has completed its full course, `j` would be `n + 1`, and since `j` starts at 4 and increments by 1 each time, if it reaches a value of `n + 1` after 5 iterations (for example), `n` must be at least 9. Thus, the final condition is that `n` must be at least 9 for the loop to complete all its iterations.
