Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain encoded values. 

For example, consider the encoded value `55`. According to the problem description, the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded is `"czz"`, which corresponds to the indices `[3, 26, 26]`. However, the program incorrectly generates `"azz"` instead. This happens because the program logic does not properly distribute the remaining value after assigning the maximum possible index (26) to the last character.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it assigns the smallest possible values to the first two characters before determining the third character. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        result = [1, 1, 1]
        for j in range(2, -1, -1):
            if lex >= 26:
                result[j] = 26
                lex -= 26
            else:
                result[j] = lex
                lex = 0
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(result[k] + 96), end='')
        print()

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the smallest possible values are assigned to the first two characters before determining the third character, thus generating the lexicographically smallest word for any given encoded value.
