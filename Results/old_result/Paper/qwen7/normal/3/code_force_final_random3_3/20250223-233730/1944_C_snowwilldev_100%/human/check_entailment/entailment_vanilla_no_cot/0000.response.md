Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic and the strategy for both players. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Game Logic Mismatch**: 
   - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, then remove it from `a`.
   - Bob can only pick an element from `a` and remove it.
   - The program does not simulate these turns correctly. It simply counts occurrences of each number in `a` and returns the smallest missing number, which doesn't account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob.

2. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she should try to leave numbers that make the MEX higher.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he should try to leave numbers that make the MEX lower.
   - The current implementation does not consider the alternating turns and the strategic choices made by both players.

3. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The example test cases provided show that the output of the current program does not match the expected results. For instance, for the input `[0, 0, 1, 1]`, the expected output is `2`, but the program would incorrectly return `0`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game turns and ensure that both players play optimally. Here's a more appropriate approach:

1. **Simulate Turns**:
   - Use two separate lists to keep track of the elements chosen by Alice and Bob.
   - Simulate the turns alternately until `a` becomes empty.

2. **Calculate MEX**:
   - After the game ends, calculate the MEX of the combined list of elements chosen by Alice and Bob.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    alice_choices = []
    bob_choices = []
    
    i = 0
    while a:
        # Alice's turn
        if i % 2 == 0:
            for j in range(len(a)):
                if a[j] not in alice_choices and a[j] not in bob_choices:
                    alice_choices.append(a[j])
                    del a[j]
                    break
        else:
            # Bob's turn
            for j in range(len(a)):
                if a[j] not in alice_choices and a[j] not in bob_choices:
                    bob_choices.append(a[j])
                    del a[j]
                    break
    
    # Combine choices and calculate MEX
    combined_choices = sorted(alice_choices + bob_choices)
    mex = 0
    while mex in combined_choices:
        mex += 1
    return mex

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())
```

This approach ensures that both players take their turns optimally and calculates the MEX correctly after the game ends.
