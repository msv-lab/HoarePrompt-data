Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next one. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, their previous values remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid, and the program continues with the next iteration of the loop.
