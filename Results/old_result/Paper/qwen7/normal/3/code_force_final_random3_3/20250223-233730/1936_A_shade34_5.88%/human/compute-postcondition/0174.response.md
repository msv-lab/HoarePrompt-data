Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `pans`, `n` is an input integer, `pans` is a list containing all integers from `0` to `len(pans) - 1`, `mak` is equal to 0, and the input value `k` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The line `mak = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `mak`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `pans`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
