Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is 10^9 except for `ans[i]` which is `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` for all 0 <= i < n-1, `ans[0]` is updated to `ans[1] - arr[0]`, `i` is decremented by 1.**

In this case, the variable `i` is decremented by 1, but the exact value of `i` is not specified in the initial state. The values of `arr` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
