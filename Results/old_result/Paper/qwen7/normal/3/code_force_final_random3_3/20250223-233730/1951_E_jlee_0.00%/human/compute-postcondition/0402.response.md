Postcondition: `done` remains `False`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 0, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `s` is a list representation of the string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first element of the list `s`, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` becomes `True` and `i` is incremented by 1, otherwise `j` is set to 1.
