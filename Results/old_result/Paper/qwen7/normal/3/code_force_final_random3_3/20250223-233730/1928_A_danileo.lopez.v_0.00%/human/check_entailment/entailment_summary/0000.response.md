Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The current implementation checks if either `a` or `b` is even and prints 'Yes' if true, otherwise prints 'No'. However, the problem requires checking if it's possible to form another distinct rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearranging them.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
1. If either `a` or `b` is even, it's always possible to form another rectangle.
2. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it's impossible to form another rectangle because cutting an odd-sized side will result in two smaller odd-sized rectangles, and no matter how you arrange them, you can't form a new distinct rectangle.

The provided program fails to handle the case where both `a` and `b` are odd. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b and a % 2 != 0:
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
```

This corrected version checks if both `a` and `b` are equal and odd. If so, it prints 'No', indicating that no other rectangle can be formed. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
