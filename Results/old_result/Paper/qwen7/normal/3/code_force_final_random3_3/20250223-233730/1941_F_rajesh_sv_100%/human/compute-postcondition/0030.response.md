Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`
   - `n`

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `max_diff`: Maximum difference found so far.
   - `next_max_diff`: Second maximum difference found so far (or -inf if no such difference exists).
   - `index`: Index where `max_diff` occurred (or None if not applicable).
   - `i`: 5.
   - `n`: Not explicitly stated but implied to be greater than 5 since the loop continues.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`.

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` starts at 5, so for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 6.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `total` is not mentioned in the loop head, so it remains unchanged.
   - `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop are:

- `i` should be 6.
- `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found so far (or -inf if no such difference exists), `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred (or None if not applicable), `i` is 6, `n` must be greater than 6**.
