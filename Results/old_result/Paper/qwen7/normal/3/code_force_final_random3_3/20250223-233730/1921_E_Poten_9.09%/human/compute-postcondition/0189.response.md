Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice' with 'Draw' appended, `i` is 4, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code appends 'Draw' to the list `answers`. The initial state of `test_cases` being greater than 3 remains unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 since the list `answers` grows by one element, making `i` equal to 4. The list `clues` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it.
