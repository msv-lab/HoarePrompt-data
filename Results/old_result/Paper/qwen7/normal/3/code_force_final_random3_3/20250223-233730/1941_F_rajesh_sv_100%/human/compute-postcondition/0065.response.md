Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` to `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` respectively. Since these values were already defined as `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` before the code execution, the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
