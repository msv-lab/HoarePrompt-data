Based on the initial state provided:

- After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n`.
- `n` must still be greater than `mdx`.
- `res` will be the count of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]` from index `mdx` to index `n-1`.

The `print(res)` statement will print the value of `res`, which is the count of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]` from index `mdx` to index `n-1`.

Output: **res (where res is the count of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]` from index `mdx` to index `n-1`)**
