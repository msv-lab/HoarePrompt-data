Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `curr` is `pres + paths[i_end + 1] * (k - (i_end + 1) - 1)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i_end + 1] + paths[i]`, `ress` is the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `ress` is updated to be the maximum of `ress` and `curr`.**

Explanation: The line `ress = max(ress, curr)` updates `ress` to be the maximum value between its current value and `curr`. All other variables (`i`, `curr`, `pres`) remain unchanged from their previous values. The most internal loop or if statement is also broken out of, as mentioned in the initial state.
