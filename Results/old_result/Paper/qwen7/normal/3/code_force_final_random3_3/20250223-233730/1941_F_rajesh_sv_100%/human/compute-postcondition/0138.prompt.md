Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_diff` is the maximum difference found across all pairs of adjacent elements in the list `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found (or -inf if no such difference exists), `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred (or None if not applicable), `i` is `n`, `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]` if `max_diff` was updated during the last iteration or does not exist otherwise, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`.
Code of the loop:
for f in F:
    l = bisect_right(D, left - f)
    h = bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1
    while l < h:
        mid = l + (h - l) // 2
        mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
        if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            h = mid
    if l == h:
        ans = min(ans, max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f), while `l` and `h` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` holds the smallest value it has been updated to throughout the process, which is determined by the maximum of (D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f) at each step. All other variables (`l`, `h`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `left`, `right`, `f`, and `D`) remain in their final states from the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `l` is equal to `h`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `ans` holds the smallest value between `ans` and `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)` throughout the process.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
