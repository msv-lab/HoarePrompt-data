Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `n-1`, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum value between `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the `cards` list also remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates `dp[i][j]` to the maximum value between `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `j` is `n-1`, after executing the line of code, `i` becomes 1. The value of `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of the two values mentioned, while the other variables and the `cards` list remain unchanged.
