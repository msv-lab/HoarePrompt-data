Output State: **`cnt` is incremented by 1, and there exists an index `i` such that `arr[i]` equals `val`.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1, meaning the count of occurrences of `val` in the array `arr` has increased by one. The condition that there exists an index `i` such that `arr[i]` equals `val` remains unchanged.
