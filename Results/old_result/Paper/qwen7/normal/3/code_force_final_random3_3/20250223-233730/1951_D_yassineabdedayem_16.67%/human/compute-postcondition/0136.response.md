Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 2 less than its initial value, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` is 1, `Min` is reassigned to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is reassigned to `max(int(n / k), k)**.

Explanation: The line `number = Max` assigns the current value of `Max` to `number`. Since `Max` was previously defined as `max(int(n / k), k)`, the value of `number` is now `max(int(n / k), k)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
