### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `input()` and converts it to an integer.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is unnecessary and should be removed or properly utilized. The function is currently defined but never called, which means the program will not perform any operations for the test cases.

3. **Test Case Processing**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program reads two integers `n` and `m` for each test case.
   - It checks if `(n - m)` is even and non-negative. If this condition is met, it prints 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative.
   - This condition is correct because:
     - Each move either adds 1 cube (increasing the count by 1) or removes 1 cube (decreasing the count by 1).
     - To end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, the net change in the number of cubes must be `m - initial_count`.
     - Since the initial count is 0, the net change must be `m`.
     - The net change `m` must be achievable by an even number of moves (since adding and removing cubes alternately results in an even net change).

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program outputs 'Yes' or 'No' correctly based on the condition.

6. **Function Usage**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not called in the main loop. Therefore, the program does not actually process any test cases and simply waits indefinitely or exits without performing any operations.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct in its implementation of the condition check, but it fails to use the defined function `func_1()` to process the test cases. As a result, the program does not produce any output for the test cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
