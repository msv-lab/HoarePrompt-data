Output State: **`x` is an integer equal to `len(rev_val)`, which is now 0, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is a string that will be updated, and `max_power` is less than or equal to the new length of `rev_res` (which is 0).**

Explanation: The code `rev_val = []` assigns an empty list to `rev_val`. This changes the length of `rev_val` to 0. Since `x` was initially equal to the length of `rev_val`, `x` is now also 0. The other variables (`rev_res` and `max_power`) remain unchanged.
