Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for j in range(n // 2):` statement. This means the loop variable `j` is the only variable directly controlled by the loop.

2. **Determine the current state of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as `j` is less than `n // 2 - 1`.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n // 2`. Since `j` was less than `n // 2 - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it must now be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body does not change `j` otherwise).

4. **Adjust the state**: Given that `j` was less than `n // 2 - 1`, after incrementing `j` by 1, `j` will now be equal to `n // 2 - 1`.

5. **List the adjusted states**: We need to ensure that `j` is exactly `n // 2 - 1` for the loop to continue executing. All other variables remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` must be less than `n // 2`, `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is `s[x] * 2`, `x` is 1, `j` is `n // 2 - 1**
