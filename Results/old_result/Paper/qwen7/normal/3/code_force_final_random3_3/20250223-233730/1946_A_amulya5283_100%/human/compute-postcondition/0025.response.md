Output State: **Postcondition: `total` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an integer greater than `mdx` and not equal to 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is 3, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and the middle index `mdx` of the list `a` has the same value as the last index `i` that was checked during the loop, with `res` incremented each time `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]`.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `res` will hold the count of how many times the element at the middle index `mdx` appears in the list `a` up to the last index `i` that was checked. The other variables (`total`, `n`, `a`, `mdx`) retain their values from the final iteration's state, with no further changes.
