Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the calculation).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `n` is updated to the first input integer.
- `a` is updated to the second input integer.
- `b` is updated to the third input integer.

The expression inside the `print` statement is `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.

Let's break it down:

1. `n` is the first input integer.
2. `b` is the third input integer.

Substituting these into the expression:

\[
(2 \times b - n + 1) \times n // 2
\]

This expression calculates a specific formula where `b` and `n` are the inputs. The result of this expression is then converted to an integer using `int()`.

So, the output will be the result of the evaluated expression with the given `n` and `b` values.

Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)**
