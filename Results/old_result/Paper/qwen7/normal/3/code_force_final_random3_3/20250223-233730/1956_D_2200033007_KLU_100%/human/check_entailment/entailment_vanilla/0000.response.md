Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
The problem requires us to maximize the sum of the array elements using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations. Each operation involves setting all elements in a subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Code
#### Function 1: `func_1`
- This function computes the maximum possible sum of the subarray from `start_index` to `end_index`.
- It uses recursion and memoization (`res_dict`) to store results of subproblems.
- The logic seems to be trying to find the optimal way to partition the subarray to maximize the sum.
- However, the approach used here is incorrect because it does not consider the MEX operation directly. Instead, it tries to partition the array in a way that maximizes the sum without considering the MEX values.

#### Function 2: `func_2`
- This function is supposed to return the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
- It calls `func_1` to get the maximum possible sum.
- If the maximum sum equals the square of the length of the subarray, it suggests a special case where the entire subarray can be filled with the same value.
- Otherwise, it recursively finds the subarrays that contribute to the maximum sum.
- The recursive calls and logic for finding the operations are also incorrect. They do not correctly implement the MEX operation.

#### Function 3: `make_stairs`
- This function is supposed to fill the subarray to form a "staircase" pattern, but it is not used correctly in the context of the problem.
- The function is called within `func_2`, but it does not correctly implement the MEX operation or the required logic to maximize the sum.

### Step 3: Correctness Analysis
- The core issue is that both `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly implement the MEX operation and the logic to maximize the sum of the array.
- The approach of partitioning the array and maximizing the sum without directly using the MEX operation is flawed.
- The provided functions do not correctly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
