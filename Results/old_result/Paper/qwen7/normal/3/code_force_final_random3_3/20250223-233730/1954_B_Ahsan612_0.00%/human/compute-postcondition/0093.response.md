Postcondition: `minn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `same`; `num` is set to the last `min(minn, same)` value found; `same` is 1 if no further elements were matched after setting `num` to the last `min(minn, same)` value; regardless of whether `minn` is initially infinity or not, `minn` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and `same`, `num` will be set to the last `min(minn, same)` value found, and `same` will be 1 if no further elements were matched after setting `num` to the last `min(minn, same)` value.
