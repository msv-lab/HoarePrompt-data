Output State: **t is a positive integer; n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6]; q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n; input function is redirected to read from standard input.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.readline` changes the input function to read from standard input (stdin) instead of the default behavior. However, it does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `q`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
