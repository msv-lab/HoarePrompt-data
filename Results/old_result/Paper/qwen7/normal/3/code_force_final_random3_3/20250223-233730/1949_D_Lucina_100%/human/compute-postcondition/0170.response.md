Postcondition: `n` must be between 2 and 24, `(xx[i][j - 1])` is equal to `'?'`, `nx` is a string. If `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is a string with the value 'F' appended to it. Otherwise, `nx` is a string with the value 'S' appended to it.
