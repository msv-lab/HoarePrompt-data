You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of six integers \(h\), \(w\), \(x_a\), \(y_a\), \(x_b\), \(y_b\). Based on specific conditions involving these integers, it appends either 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw' to a list named `answers`. After processing all test cases, it prints each element of the `answers` list. The final state of the program is that `answers` contains at least three elements, each being either 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw', corresponding to the outcome of each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Conditions and Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where Alice is in the last row (`x_a = h`). In this scenario, Alice cannot move further and the game ends in a draw.
   - Similarly, it correctly handles the case where Bob is in the first row (`x_b = 1`). Here, Bob cannot move further and the game also ends in a draw.

2. **Parity Check:**
   - The program checks the parity (even or odd) of the initial positions of Alice and Bob. This is a crucial part of determining the outcome because the movements are restricted to specific directions, which can affect whether a player can force a win.

3. **Position Comparison:**
   - The program compares the initial positions of Alice and Bob to determine who can force a win. Specifically, it checks if the absolute difference between their initial column positions is greater than 1, which can influence the outcome based on the parity check.

4. **Detailed Analysis of Each Case:**
   - For each test case, the program evaluates the positions and applies the rules to determine the winner or if the game is a draw.
   - The logic for determining the winner involves checking if the absolute difference between the initial column positions is more than 1, and if so, whether the player can force a win based on the parity of their starting positions.

5. **Output Validation:**
   - The program outputs the result for each test case, ensuring that the output matches the expected outcomes provided in the example.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the code and the provided test cases, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the game outcome based on the given rules. The conditions and comparisons in the code align with the problem description and produce the correct results for the provided examples.

### Correctness:
