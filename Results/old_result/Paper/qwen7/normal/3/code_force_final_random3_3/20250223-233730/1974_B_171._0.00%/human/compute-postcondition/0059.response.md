Output State: **`c` is 99; `char` is the next character in `encoded`; `mapping[chr(99)]` is assigned the value of `char`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `char` to the key `chr(c)` in the dictionary `mapping`. Since `c` is 99, the key in the dictionary becomes `chr(99)`, which is the character with ASCII value 99 (i.e., 'c'). The value of `char` is assigned to this key. The other variables remain unchanged.
