Output State: **`done` is set to `True`, `count` is either equal to `j` or greater than 0, `s[j]` remains not equal to `x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement that was checking the condition `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]`. The values of `done`, `count`, and `s[j]` remain unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify these variables.
