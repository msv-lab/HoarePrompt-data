Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, both of which are positive integers with a constraint of 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. The function returns a tuple containing the values of `cnt`, `i`, `m`, `x`, and `y`, where `cnt` is 8, `i` is 5, `m` is at least 3, `x` is -21, and `y` is 25.**
