Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element; `r_x` is `-num % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `num % y` to `r_y`. The initial values of `arr` and `r_x` remain unchanged. Therefore, `arr` must have at least one element, `r_x` is `-num % x`, and `r_y` is `num % y`.
