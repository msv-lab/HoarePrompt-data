Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the tuple `(v1, v2)` and the list `ops[::-1]`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the reversed list `ops[::-1]`. This means the loop will execute as long as there are elements in `ops`.

3. **Initial state of the variables**:
   - `vx` has exactly 2 elements remaining.
   - `ops` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed during each iteration.
   - `p1` is now a list containing the elements of `vx`.
   - `p2` is an empty list.

4. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `ops` has at least one element.
   - The variables `v1` and `v2` will be set to the values from the tuples in `ops[::-1]` during each iteration.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can start by adjusting the state of `ops` to have at least one element. The other variables (`vx`, `p1`, and `p2`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to start and can be adjusted accordingly.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: `ops` must have at least one element, `v1` and `v2` are the first tuple elements in `ops[::-1]`, `vx` has exactly 2 elements remaining, `p1` is now a list containing the elements of `vx`, `p2` is an empty list.**

However, since the question asks to focus only on the states of objects in the loop head, we primarily need to ensure `ops` has at least one element.

**Final State: `ops` must have at least one element.**
