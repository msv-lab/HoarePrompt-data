You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

    2000000000000000002
    
Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        A = int(m / a) + 1
        B = int(m / b) + 1
        print(A + B)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases (up to 10,000). For each test case, it reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) and calculates two values \(A\) and \(B\) based on these inputs. Specifically, \(A\) is set to \(\text{int}(m / a) + 1\) and \(B\) is set to \(\text{int}(m / b) + 1\). The function then prints the sum \(A + B\) for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`.

2. **Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `A` as `int(m / a) + 1`.
   - It calculates `B` as `int(m / b) + 1`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the sum of `A` and `B`.

### Reasoning

#### Correctness of Calculation
- **Understanding the Problem**: 
  - Fireworks launched by the first installation are visible every `a` minutes.
  - Fireworks launched by the second installation are visible every `b` minutes.
  - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.
  - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

- **Calculation Explanation**:
  - `A` represents the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period `m + 1` minutes.
  - `B` represents the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the same period.
  - Adding these together gives the total number of fireworks visible at any point in time.

- **Formula Analysis**:
  - `A = int(m / a) + 1` means the number of times the first installation launches fireworks within the interval `[0, m]`.
  - `B = int(m / b) + 1` means the number of times the second installation launches fireworks within the interval `[0, m]`.

- **Summing Up**:
  - The sum `A + B` gives the maximum number of fireworks visible at any moment because the intervals of launches are independent.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the example provided:

- **Test Case 1**: `a = 6`, `b = 7`, `m = 4`
  - `A = int(4 / 6) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - `B = int(4 / 7) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - `A + B = 1 + 1 = 2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: `a = 3`, `b = 4`, `m = 10`
  - `A = int(10 / 3) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`
  - `B = int(10 / 4) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`
  - `A + B = 4 + 3 = 7` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**: `a = 7`, `b = 8`, `m = 56`
  - `A = int(56 / 7) + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9`
  - `B = int(56 / 8) + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8`
  - `A + B = 9 + 8 = 17` (Correct)

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time based on the given logic. Therefore, the program is correct.
