Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a string.
- `j` is an index within the string `s`.
- `done` is set to `True`.
- The most internal loop or if statement breaks if the character at index `j` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1.
- `count` is equal to `j` if the current value of `count` is greater than 0 and the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`.

The print statement is simply `print(2)`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
