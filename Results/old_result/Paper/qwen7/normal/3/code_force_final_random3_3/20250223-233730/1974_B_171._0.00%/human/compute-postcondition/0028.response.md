Postcondition: **`c` must be within the range 97 to 123 (inclusive), `char` is the next character in encoded, `decoded` either has one more element than before with the last element being the decoded value corresponding to `char` in mapping, or `decoded` remains unchanged. The current value of `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`**.
