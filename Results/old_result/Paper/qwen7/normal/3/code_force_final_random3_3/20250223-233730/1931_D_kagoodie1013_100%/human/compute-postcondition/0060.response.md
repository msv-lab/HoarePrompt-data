Output State: **`count` is 0, `results` is `[0]`, `residue_map` is `{(num % x, num % y): 1}`, `n` is the number of elements in the next test case array, `x` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `y` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `arr` is the next test case array without the first element, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `r_y = num % y`**

Explanation: The code `r_y = num % y` assigns the remainder of `num` divided by `y` to the variable `r_y`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the value of `r_y` is updated to `num % y`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
