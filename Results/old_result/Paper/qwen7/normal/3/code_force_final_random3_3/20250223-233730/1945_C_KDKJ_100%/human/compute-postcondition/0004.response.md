Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved here are the input value used to determine the number of iterations and the loop counter (which is `_` but we don't need to worry about it specifically since it's an underscore).

2. **Determine the Input Value**: The loop will run based on the integer input provided by the user. Since we don't know the exact input value from the given information, let's denote the input value as `k`.

3. **Adjust the State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `func_1()` has already been called. This means that the loop has already executed once. Therefore, the loop will execute again if the user inputs a value that is greater than 0.

4. **Update the State**: For the loop to execute one more time, the user must input a positive integer. Let's assume the user inputs `k+1` where `k` is the number of times the loop has already executed. 

Given that the loop has already executed once, `k = 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the user must input `2`.

State: **`func_1()` has already been called, the input value must be 2**
