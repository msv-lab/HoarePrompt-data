Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers (with all elements removed), `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, and `func_1(n, p)` has been appended to `res` for every element in `qs`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged. The list `p` and `qs` will be empty since all elements have been processed. The list `res` will contain the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in the original `qs`.
