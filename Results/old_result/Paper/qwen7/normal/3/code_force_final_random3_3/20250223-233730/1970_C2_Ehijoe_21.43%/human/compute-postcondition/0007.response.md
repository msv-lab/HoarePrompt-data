Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[v]` now contains the value `[u]`**.

Explanation: The code `nodes[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `nodes[v]`. Initially, `nodes[v]` contains the value `v`. After executing the code, `nodes[v]` will contain the value `[v, u]`. However, since `v` is already in the list, it is more accurate to say that `nodes[v]` now contains the value `[u]` because `v` was already there and the code only appends `u`.
