You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` must be equal to the initial value of `t`, `n` is an integer for each iteration, and if `n` is odd, it remains odd. If `n` is even, it remains even. Additionally, `s` is a string consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times for each even `n`, with the length of `s` being either less than 200 or 200 or more for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n`. For each `n`, it checks if `n` is odd or even. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even and the resulting string `s` (consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times) has a length less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by `s`; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function ultimately ensures that for each test case, it provides a binary outcome ('YES' or 'NO') based on the conditions specified.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Special Character Definition**: The problem states that a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. However, the program does not check if a character meets this condition. Instead, it generates a string with alternating characters ('110') repeated to form a string of length `n`.
3. **String Generation**: The string `'110'` is used to generate the output. This string will have three characters where the middle character is different from its neighbors, but this does not necessarily mean it will meet the special character requirement for all positions in the generated string.
4. **Length Check**: The program checks if the generated string `s` is less than 200 characters long, which is unnecessary because the problem guarantees that if a solution exists, it can be within 200 characters.
5. **Odd Length Handling**: The program correctly handles the case where `n` is odd by printing 'NO', as an odd-length string cannot have all characters as special according to the definition.
6. **Even Length Handling**: For even `n`, the program generates a string of length `3 * (n // 2)` using `'110'`. This string will have `(n // 2)` special characters, but it does not guarantee that these characters will be positioned such that they are special according to the problem statement.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 6`
  - The generated string is `'110110'`, which has 2 special characters (positions 2 and 4). This does not satisfy the requirement of having exactly 6 special characters.
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 1`
  - The generated string would be `'1'`, which does not have any special characters.
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 2`
  - The generated string would be `'110'`, which has 1 special character (position 3).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that the generated string has exactly `n` special characters as defined in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
