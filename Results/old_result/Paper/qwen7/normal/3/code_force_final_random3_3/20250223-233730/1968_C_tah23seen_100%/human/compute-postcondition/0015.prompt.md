You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where `ans[0]` is `ans[1] - arr[0]`, `ans[1]` is `ans[2] - arr[1]`, and so on until `ans[n-2]` is `ans[n-1] - arr[n-2]`, with all other elements in `ans` still being \(10^9\), `i` is now -1.
    #
    #This means after the loop completes all its iterations, the `ans` list will have its first `n-1` elements updated based on the given formula, and the last element (`ans[n-1]`) remains unchanged as it has no corresponding `arr` value to subtract from it. The variable `i` will be set to -1 since the loop condition `i >= 0` will no longer be satisfied.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where the first `n-1` elements are calculated based on the formula `ans[i] = ans[i+1] - arr[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-2`, and the last element `ans[n-1]` remains unchanged as it is not involved in any subtraction. Additionally, all elements except the first `n-1` are set to \(10^9\), and the variable `i` is set to `-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `arr` of n-1 integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where the first `n-1` elements are calculated using the formula `ans[i] = ans[i+1] - arr[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-2`, and the last element `ans[n-1]` remains unchanged. All elements except the first `n-1` are set to \(10^9\), and the variable `i` is set to `-1`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where the first `n-1` elements are calculated based on the formula `ans[i] = ans[i+1] - arr[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-2`, and the last element `ans[n-1]` remains unchanged as it is not involved in any subtraction. Additionally, all elements except the first `n-1` are set to \(10^9\), and the variable `i` is set to `-1`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
