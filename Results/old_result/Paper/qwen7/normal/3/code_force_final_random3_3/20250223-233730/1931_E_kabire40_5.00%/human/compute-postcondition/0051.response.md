Postcondition: **`rev_res` will be a string that concatenates the integer representations of even-indexed elements from `rev_val` and the reversed versions of odd-indexed elements from `rev_val`, in the order they appear in `rev_val`. Additionally, `10 ** int(max_power)` is less than or equal to `int(rev_res)`**
