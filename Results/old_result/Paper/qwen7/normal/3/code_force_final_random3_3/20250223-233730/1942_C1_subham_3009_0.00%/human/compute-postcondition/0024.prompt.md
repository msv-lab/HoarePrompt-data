You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y = 0. The input also includes a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, and the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    if (__name__ == '__main__') :
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            
            arr = input().split()
            
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            
            print(x - 2)
            
        #State: Output State: `t` is equal to 0; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the input split, `x` is the integer value of the second element of the input split, `y` is the integer value of the third element of the input split, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from converting the first `x` elements of the input split into integers.
        #
        #This output state occurs because the loop continues to execute as long as `t > 0`. After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1. Therefore, if the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will eventually reach 0. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their last state within the loop, as these values are determined by the input during each iteration and not modified within the loop itself.
    #State: `t` is equal to 0, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the input split, `x` is the integer value of the second element of the input split, `y` is the integer value of the third element of the input split, and `arr` is a list of integers obtained from converting the first `x` elements of the input split into integers.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes integers t, n, x, and y (where t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y is always 0), along with a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. It then returns a result based on the given conditions for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
