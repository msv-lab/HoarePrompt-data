Output State: **`vis` is a list of length `n` where all elements are 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is updated to 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `pb` is the final value it reaches after following the links in the list `p` until a previously visited node is encountered, `ps` is an integer from input, `P_S` is an unchanged positive integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `MOD` is 1000000007, `pathb` is an empty list, `vis[pb - 1]` remains unchanged, `paths` is a list with the element `a[ps - 1]` appended to it, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block. All other variables retain their previous states.
