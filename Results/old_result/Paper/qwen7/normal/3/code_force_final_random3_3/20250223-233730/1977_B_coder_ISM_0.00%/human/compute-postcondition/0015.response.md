Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with one additional element '0', `i` is 30**

The code `s.append('0')` adds the string `'0'` to the list `s`. The other variables (`t`, `x`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0, `x` remains an input integer, `s` now contains all its previous elements plus the new element `'0'`, and `i` remains 30.
