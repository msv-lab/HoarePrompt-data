Reasoning:
1. The goal of the function `func_1` is to decode the `encoded` string back to the original string `s`.
2. The function creates a mapping of characters from the `encoded` string to the corresponding characters in the original string `s`.
3. The function iterates through each character in the `encoded` string:
   - If the character is already in the `mapping`, it appends the corresponding decoded character to the `decoded` list.
   - If the character is not in the `mapping`, it finds the next available character in the alphabet that hasn't been used yet and maps it to the current character in the `encoded` string.
4. After processing all characters in the `encoded` string, the function returns the decoded string by joining the `decoded` list.

However, there is a logical error in the implementation of the function. Specifically, the logic to find the next available character in the alphabet that hasn't been used yet is flawed. The variable `c` is incremented and checked against the values in the `mapping`, but this approach does not correctly handle the case where the `encoded` string has duplicate characters.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(encoded):
    # Create a list of all distinct characters in the encoded string
    distinct_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    
    # Create a mapping from each character in the distinct_chars list to its position
    mapping = {char: distinct_chars[-i-1] for i, char in enumerate(distinct_chars)}
    
    # Decode the encoded string using the mapping
    decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    
    return decoded
```

With this corrected function, the program should work as intended.

Correctness: **False**

The provided function does not correctly decode the `encoded` string because it incorrectly handles the mapping of characters. The corrected function above should be used instead.
