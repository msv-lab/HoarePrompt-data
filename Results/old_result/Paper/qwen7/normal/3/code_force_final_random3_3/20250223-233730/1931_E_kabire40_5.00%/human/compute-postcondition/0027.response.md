Output State: **`len(rev_val)` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `x` modulo 2 equals 0, `val_in` is an integer from `rev_val[0]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value from `rev_val` at index `x` (which is 0) to the variable `val_in`. Since `x` is 0 and `x` modulo 2 equals 0, the initial conditions for `x` remain unchanged. The length of `rev_val` also remains greater than 0. Therefore, `val_in` is now an integer derived from the first element of `rev_val`.
