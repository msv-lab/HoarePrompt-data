Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `n` must be between 2 and 24
   - `nx` is either 'S' or 'F'
   - `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'
   - Additional condition: If `i` is in the range from `0` to `n // 4 - 1` or `j` is in the same range, then `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` remains 'F'.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` in the range from `1` to `n + 1`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The variable `j` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `2`.
   - The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The value of `nx` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but based on the given conditions, `nx` will remain 'S' if `i` is in the specified range or 'F' otherwise.

4. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `j` starts from `1` and the loop runs until `j` reaches `n + 1`, the first iteration sets `j = 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be `2`.

5. **Final Adjusted States:**
   - `i` remains `n + 1`
   - `n` remains between 2 and 24
   - `nx` remains either 'S' or 'F'
   - `xx[i][j - 1]` is still '?'
   - The condition for `nx` remains the same: If `i` is in the range from `0` to `n // 4 - 1` or `j` is in the same range, then `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` remains 'F'.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be between 2 and 24, `nx` is either 'S' or 'F', `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', and if `i` is in the range from `0` to `n // 4 - 1` or `j` (now 2) is in the same range, then `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` remains 'F'.**
