Reasoning:
- The function `func_1()` correctly processes the input and constructs the necessary logic to find valid pairs of cards that could have been played in the game.
- The function initializes variables to keep track of the trump cards and the highest non-trump cards for each suit.
- It correctly identifies valid pairs of cards for each suit and formats them appropriately.
- The function handles the case where a trump card beats a non-trump card.
- The function also handles the case where no valid pairs can be formed, printing "IMPOSSIBLE" as required.
- The overall logic of the function aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples.

Given the detailed analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
