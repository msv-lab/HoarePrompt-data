Output State: **`i` is `n`, `x` is an input integer, `flag` is `True`, and `l` is a list of integers created from the input.**

Explanation: The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the input into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. The variables `i`, `x`, and `flag` remain unchanged from their initial states.
