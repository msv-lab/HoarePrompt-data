Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user**.

The code creates a new variable `arr` and assigns it the value of the string input by the user using `input()`. The other variables (`t`, `_`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
