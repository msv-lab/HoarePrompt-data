Given the initial state:
- `j` is 1
- `n` is 1
- `done` is True
- `count` is 1
- `count2` remains unchanged (though its value is not needed for this specific print statement)

We need to evaluate the expression `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.

Since `string` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, let's assume it is a string for the sake of this example. Let's denote the string as `string = "example"` (the actual value does not affect the general logic).

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `string[:j]` means taking the substring from the start of `string` up to index `j-1`. Since `j` is 1, `string[:j]` is `string[0:1]`, which is `"e"`.
2. `string[j:]` means taking the substring starting from index `j` to the end of `string`. Since `j` is 1, `string[j:]` is `string[1:]`, which is `"xample"`.

Therefore, the print statement will output these two substrings separated by a comma.

Output: **"e", "xample"**
