Postcondition: **`rev_val` is either an empty list or a list containing the reversed string of `x` (`'x_reversed'`), `rev_res` is either the original string `x` or the original string `x` plus the string `x`, `list_len` is the length of the input string, `max_power` is the maximum power of the input string, `operational_list` is a list created from the split input and now has one less element, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`, `x_rev` is calculated as `int(x[::-1])`, and `rev_val` now contains the reversed string of `x` if `len(str(x_rev))` equals the length of `x`.**
