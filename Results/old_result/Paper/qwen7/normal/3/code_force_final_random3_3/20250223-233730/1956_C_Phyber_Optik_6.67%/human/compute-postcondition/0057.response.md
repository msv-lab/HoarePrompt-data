Output State: **`sum` is 0, `r` is 1, `j` is `n + 1 + 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
