Postcondition: `max_sum` remains unchanged, `best_y` remains unchanged, `x` retains its original value, `y` is decremented by 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y-1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (y-1)`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to `y`. Otherwise, the values remain as they were before the if statement executed.
