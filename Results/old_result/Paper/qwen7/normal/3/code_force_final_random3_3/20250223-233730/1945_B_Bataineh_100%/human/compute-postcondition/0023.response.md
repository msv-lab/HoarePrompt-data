Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`. Therefore, `t` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it becomes 1.
   - `t` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

6. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**.
