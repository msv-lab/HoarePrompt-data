Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop iterates over `operational_list` using the variable `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `operational_list`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - `x`: This is the current element from `operational_list` being processed in the loop.
   - `x_rev`: This is the integer representation of the reverse of `x`.
   - `rev_res`: This list contains `x` if the length of `x` is equal to the length of `x_rev`.
   - `rev_val`: This list contains the reversed string of `x` if the length of `x` is not equal to the length of `x_rev`.

4. **Analyze the conditions**:
   - If the length of `x` is equal to the length of `x_rev`, then `rev_res` contains `x` and `rev_val` is an empty list.
   - If the length of `x` is not equal to the length of `x_rev`, then `rev_res` is empty and `rev_val` contains the reversed string of `x`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `x`: The next element from `operational_list` will be processed in the next iteration.
   - `x_rev`: The integer representation of the reverse of the next element from `operational_list`.
   - `rev_res`: Since we don't know the outcome of the next iteration, it remains as it is.
   - `rev_val`: Since we don't know the outcome of the next iteration, it remains as it is.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next element from `operational_list`.

**State: **`x` is the next element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reverse of `x`, `rev_res` contains `x` if the length of `x` is equal to the length of `x_rev` and is an empty list otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x` if the length of `x` is not equal to the length of `x_rev` and is an empty list otherwise**.
