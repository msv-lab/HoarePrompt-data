Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be less than `n // 2`
- `i` is defined as `t + n // 2`
- `n` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 11
- `ans` is increased by `2 * s[x]` for each of the `n // 2 - 1` iterations, where `x` is increased by 1 after each iteration
- `j` is defined as `n // 2 - 1`

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
