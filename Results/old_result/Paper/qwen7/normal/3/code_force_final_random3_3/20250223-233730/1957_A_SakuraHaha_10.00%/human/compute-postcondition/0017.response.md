Output State: **`ans` is 0 + x // 4 + x // 4 + x // 4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least two values**

Explanation: The variable `ans` was initially set to `0 + x // 4 + x // 4`. After executing `ans += x // 4`, `ans` is incremented by `x // 4`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` becomes `0 + x // 4 + x // 4 + x // 4`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
