Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes values for `t`, `n`, and `m` where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 100. Based on these values, the function returns different outputs for each test case.**

However, since the specific outputs for different test cases are not provided in the given information, the exact nature of the return values cannot be specified. The function likely iterates over `t` test cases, processes `n` and `m` for each case, and returns some result based on these values.
