Output State: **`results` is [number of elements in heap - 1], `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in heap + 1, `operations` is 1, `heap` is now a min-heap containing `arr[median_index + 1:]`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index + 1]`, `smallest` is the smallest element from the original heap.**

Explanation: The code `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. The heap size is reduced by one, so `results` is updated to reflect the new number of elements in the heap. The `operations` counter is incremented by 1. The `median_index` and `current_median` are updated to reflect the new median after removing the smallest element.
