### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

1. **Reading Input and Setting Up the Initial Conditions:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array `a` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Modifying Array Elements:**
   - The program correctly modifies each element `a[i]` by adding `i + 1`, which aligns with the problem statement.

3. **Using a Counter and Set:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each modified value.
   - It converts the list to a set to remove duplicates, ensuring that each value in the set is unique.

4. **Constructing the Result Array `b`:**
   - The program sorts the set in descending order.
   - It then constructs the result array `ans` by ensuring the maximum possible values are placed first.
   - The logic for handling remaining elements and ensuring the maximum values are placed first is sound.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly by appending the last value minus one for the required number of times if there are remaining elements to add to the result array.

### Detailed Verification:

1. **Modification of Array Elements:**
   - The modification `a[i] += i + 1` is correctly implemented and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - Using a `set` to remove duplicates ensures that each value in the set is unique, as required by the problem statement.

3. **Sorting and Constructing `b`:**
   - Sorting the set in descending order and constructing the result array `ans` in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order is correct. The logic for handling remaining elements and ensuring the maximum values are placed first is sound.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as when there are remaining elements to add to the result array by appending the last value minus one for the required number of times.

### Detailed Evaluation with Annotations:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is read and is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
  - For each test case, `n` is read and is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
  - `a` is read as a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).

- **After Modifying Array Elements:**
  - Each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`.
  - This step is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

- **Using a Counter and Set:**
  - `Counter(a)` counts occurrences of each modified value.
  - Converting `a` to a set removes duplicates.
  - Sorting the set in descending order ensures the highest values are considered first.

- **Constructing the Result Array `ans`:**
  - The program iterates through the sorted set and constructs the result array `ans` by ensuring the maximum possible values are placed first.
  - Handling remaining elements by appending the last value minus one for the required number of times is correct.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles edge cases by ensuring the result array `ans` is constructed in the desired lexicographical order.

### Conclusion:

Given the detailed verification and the annotations provided, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It processes the input, modifies the array elements, removes duplicates, sorts them, and constructs the lexicographically largest array `b` as required.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
