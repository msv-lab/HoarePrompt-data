Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value, `arr` contains the elements [26, 26]**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the list `arr`. Since `arr` initially contained the element 26, after appending, `arr` now contains the elements [26, 26]. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged from their initial states.
