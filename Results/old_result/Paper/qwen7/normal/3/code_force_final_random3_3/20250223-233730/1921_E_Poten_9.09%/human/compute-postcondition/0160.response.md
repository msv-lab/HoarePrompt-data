Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `i` is set to 1, so after the increment (which is implied but not shown in the snippet), `i` becomes 2. The other variables (`test_cases` and `clues`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
