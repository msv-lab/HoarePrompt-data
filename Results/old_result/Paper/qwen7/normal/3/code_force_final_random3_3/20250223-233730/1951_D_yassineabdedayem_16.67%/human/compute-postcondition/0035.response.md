Output State: **`rep` is 2, `k` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `Max` (which is `max(int(n / k), k)`) to the variable `number`. All other variables (`rep`, `k`, `Min`, and `Max`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
