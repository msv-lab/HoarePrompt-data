Output State: **`results` is [number of elements in heap - 1], `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in heap + 4, `operations` is 4, `heap` is now a min-heap containing `arr[median_index + 1:]` with the smallest element being `current_median + 1`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `smallest + 1`, `smallest` is the second smallest element from the original heap after removing the smallest element.**

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value `smallest + 1` into the heap. Given that `smallest` is the second smallest element from the original heap after removing the smallest element, and `current_median` is `smallest + 1`, the new smallest element in the heap is now `current_median + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
