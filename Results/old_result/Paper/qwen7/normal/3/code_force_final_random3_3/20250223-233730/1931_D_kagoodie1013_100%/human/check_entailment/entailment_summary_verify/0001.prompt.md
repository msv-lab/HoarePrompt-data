You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `test_cases` as input. Each tuple contains three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) followed by a list of \( n \) integers representing the array \( a \). It processes each test case to count the occurrences of each unique pair \((r_x, r_y)\), where \( r_x = -num \mod x \) and \( r_y = num \mod y \) for each element \( num \) in the array. The function accumulates these counts into a list `results`, which it returns. Additionally, it maintains a dictionary `residue_map` that records the frequency of each unique \((r_x, r_y)\) pair. After processing all test cases, the function returns the `results` list and the `residue_map` dictionary. The final states of the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `num`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key` reflect their state just before the last element of the last array is processed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into parts.
   - It correctly parses the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it correctly extracts `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to process each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, it initializes a counter `count` to zero and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of residues.
   - For each element in the array, it calculates the required residues:
     - `r_x = -num % x`: This computes the residue such that `(num + r_x) % x == 0`.
     - `r_y = num % y`: This computes the residue such that `(num - r_y) % y == 0`.
   - It then checks if this combination of residues exists in `residue_map` and increments the count accordingly.
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the current element's residues.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating `r_x` is slightly off. Specifically, `-num % x` should be adjusted to ensure it correctly handles negative numbers. The correct way to handle this is `r_x = (x - (num % x)) % x`.
   - The rest of the logic seems correct and follows the problem statement.

### Corrected Code:

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
    index += 3
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
results = func_1(test_cases)
print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        residue_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            r_x = (x - (num % x)) % x  # Corrected calculation for r_x
            r_y = num % y
            count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
            current_key = (num % x, num % y)
            residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the program and making the necessary correction, the program now correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. Therefore, the original program is almost correct but needs a small adjustment in the calculation of `r_x`.

**Correctness:** **True**
