Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + 2 * n`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx-2*n:idx-n]` converted using `map(int, ...)`**

Explanation: Initially, `idx` is incremented by `n`. Then, the code increments `idx` by `n` again, making the total increment `2 * n`. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it was defined based on the previous value of `idx`, which is now `idx - n` and `idx - 2 * n`.
