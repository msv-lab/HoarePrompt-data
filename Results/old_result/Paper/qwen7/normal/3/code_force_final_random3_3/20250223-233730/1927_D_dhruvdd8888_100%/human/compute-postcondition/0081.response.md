Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `e` is the third element of the same tuple.
- `n` is a positive integer inputted initially.
- `eli` is updated to the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`.
- `l` and `r` are assigned the values of two integers inputted via `input().split()` and converted to integers using `map(int)`.
- The number of remaining iterations is reduced by 1.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

This `print` statement directly outputs `-1 -1` regardless of the values of any other variables or objects. Therefore, the output is simply the literal values provided in the `print` statement.

Output: **-1 -1**
