Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `arr` must have at least 2 elements.
   - `item` is `arr[1]`.
   - `res` is an input string.
   - If `res` is '>', then `mini` is `arr[1]`. Otherwise, there is no change in `res` and `item`.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for item in arr[1:]:
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable that changes within the loop head is `item`. The loop iterates over the elements starting from `arr[1]`.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `arr[1:]` must exist. This means `arr` must have at least 3 elements (since `arr[1]` was used in the previous iteration).

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `arr` must have at least 3 elements.
   - `item` will be the next element in `arr[1:]`, which is `arr[2]`.
   - `res` remains unchanged.
   - `mini` remains unchanged unless `res` is '>', but since we don't know the value of `res` in this context, we assume it remains as it was.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`arr` must have at least 3 elements, `item` is `arr[2]`, `res` is an input string, `mini` is unchanged if `res` was '>' previously.**
