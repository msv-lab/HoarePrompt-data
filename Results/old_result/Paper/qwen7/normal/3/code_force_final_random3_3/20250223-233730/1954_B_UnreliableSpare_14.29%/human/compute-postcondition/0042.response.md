Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` for each iteration, `cnt` is incremented by 1 for each element in `arr`, and `i` is equal to `n` (the length of `arr`).**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. This operation does not affect the list `arr`, the length of `arr` (which is stored in `n`), or the variable `i` which is set to `n` after the loop. The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1 for each element in `arr`, but since the exact value of `cnt` is not specified, we only note that it is incremented for each element. The value of `ans` is updated during each iteration based on the current value of `cnt`.
