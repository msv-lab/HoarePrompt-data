Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of the input provided by the user, which is treated as a string regardless of the original integer value of `n`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was only referenced but not modified.
