Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n-1` integers (with the first element removed), `cnt` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `{x: 2}`, where `x` is the second element of the original list `a`, and the index of `x` in `a` is 0**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cnt[x]` by incrementing its current value by 1. Initially, `cnt[x]` is set to 1. After executing `cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1`, the value of `cnt[x]` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
