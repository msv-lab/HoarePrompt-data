Output State: **`res` now contains the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` appended to its previous contents, `n` is the fourth element of `qs`, and `qs` still has at least two elements.**

Explanation: The code `res.append(func_1(n, p))` appends the value returned by the function `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the fourth element of `qs`, and `qs` still has at least two elements.
