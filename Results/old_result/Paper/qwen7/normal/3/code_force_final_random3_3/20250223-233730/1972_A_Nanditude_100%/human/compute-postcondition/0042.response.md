Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and the range `range(n)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - `j` is between 0 and `n-1`.
   - `cnt` is either 0 or 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `b` is a list of integers input by the user.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range `0` to `n-1`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `j` is currently between 0 and `n-1`, the next value of `j` should be `j + 1` (assuming `j` starts from 0).
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is the upper bound of the range and does not change within the loop.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` remains 1 because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` is incremented by 1, so if `j` was previously `k` (where `0 <= k < n-1`), now `j` is `k+1`.
   - `cnt` remains either 0 or 1 because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `a` and `b` remain the same as they are not part of the loop head.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `j` is between 1 and `n-1`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user**.
