Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the string input by the user without any leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the string input by the user without any leading or trailing spaces.**

The code `b = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing spaces from it, and assigns the result to the variable `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
