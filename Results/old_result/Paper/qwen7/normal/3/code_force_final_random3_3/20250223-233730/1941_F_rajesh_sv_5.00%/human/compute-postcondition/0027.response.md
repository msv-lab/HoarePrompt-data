Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The only variable being modified within the loop head is `i`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1`. Each iteration updates `i` to the next value.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `max_diff` is equal to `diff` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise `max_diff` remains `-inf`.
   - `next_max_diff` is equal to `diff` if `diff > next_max_diff`, otherwise it remains unchanged.
   - `index` is `i` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise it remains `None`.
   - `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` retain their original values from `func_4()`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - All other variables (`max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `diff`, `A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F`) remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `max_diff` remains as it was.
   - `next_max_diff` remains as it was.
   - `index` remains as it was.
   - `diff` remains as it was.
   - `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` retain their original values from `func_4()`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`max_diff` is equal to `diff` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise `max_diff` remains `-inf`. `next_max_diff` is equal to `diff` if `diff > next_max_diff`, otherwise it remains unchanged. `index` is `i` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise it remains `None`. `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` retain their original values from `func_4()`**.
