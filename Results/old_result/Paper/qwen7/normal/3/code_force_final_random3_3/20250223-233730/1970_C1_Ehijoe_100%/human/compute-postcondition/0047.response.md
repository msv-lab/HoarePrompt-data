The loop condition is `curr != e`. The variables involved in the loop head are `curr` and `e`. The loop continues as long as `curr` is not equal to `e`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition tells us that:
- `tree` now contains the current element `curr`.
- If `nodes[curr][0]` is equal to `prev`, then `curr` is updated to `nodes[curr][1]`.
- Otherwise, `curr` remains as `nodes[curr][0]` and `prev` is updated to `nodes[curr][0]`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `curr` is not equal to `e` at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `curr` is not equal to `e`.

Since `curr` is updated based on the values in `nodes[curr][0]` and `nodes[curr][1]`, and `prev` is updated accordingly, the key is to ensure that `curr` is not equal to `e` after the update.

Given the postcondition, we can summarize the necessary adjustments:
- `curr` should not be equal to `e` after the update.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `curr` is not equal to `e`.

State: **`tree` now contains the current element `curr` and `curr` must not be equal to `e`**
