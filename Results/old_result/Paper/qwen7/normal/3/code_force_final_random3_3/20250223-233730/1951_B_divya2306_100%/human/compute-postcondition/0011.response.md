Output State: **`wins` is increased by 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement we were inside. The values of `wins`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
