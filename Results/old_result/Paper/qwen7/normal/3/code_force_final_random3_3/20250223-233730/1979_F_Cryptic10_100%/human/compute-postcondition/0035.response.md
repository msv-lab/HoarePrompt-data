Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the tuple `(v1, v2)` which is being unpacked from `ops[::-1]`.

2. **Understand the Initial State**:
   - `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, which are the last two integers from the original set from 1 to `n`.
   - `p1` is a list containing the first element of `vx` and an empty list.
   - `p2` is an empty list.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `ops[::-1]`. This means `ops[::-1]` must contain at least one element.
   - Each iteration of the loop will unpack a pair `(v1, v2)` from `ops[::-1]`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop depends on `ops[::-1]`, we need to ensure that `ops[::-1]` has at least one element. Therefore, `ops` must have at least two elements (since it is reversed and we are taking the reverse slice).
   - The values of `v1` and `v2` will be the elements from `ops[::-1]`, but we don't know their specific values yet. However, we need to ensure that they exist.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `ops` must have at least two elements.
- `vx` remains unchanged since it is not directly used in the loop.
- `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged since they are not directly used in the loop.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: `ops` must have at least 2 elements**
