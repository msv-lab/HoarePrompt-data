Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is between 2 and 24, `sa` will contain all indices \( i \) (from 2 to \( n \)) where \( a[i] > 0 \) and \( b[i] == 0 \), and `sb` will contain all indices \( i \) (from 2 to \( n \)) where \( b[i] > 0 \) and \( a[i] == 0 \). If \( a[i] == 0 \) and \( b[i] == 0 \), then `sb` now includes index \( i \); if \( a[i] == 0 \) and \( b[i] == 0 \), `sb` now includes the index `i`.
