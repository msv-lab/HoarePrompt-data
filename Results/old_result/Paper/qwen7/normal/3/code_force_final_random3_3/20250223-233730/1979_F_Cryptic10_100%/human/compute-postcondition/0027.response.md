Output State: **`vx` does not contain `v3`, `v2` is the new second last element of `vx`, and `ops` is a list containing two tuples.**

Explanation: The code `vx.remove(v3)` removes the element `v3` from the list `vx`. Given that `v2` is the new second last element of `vx`, it implies that `v3` was the last element before the removal. The precondition that `vx` has at least 2 elements remains valid. The variable `ops` is not affected by this operation.
