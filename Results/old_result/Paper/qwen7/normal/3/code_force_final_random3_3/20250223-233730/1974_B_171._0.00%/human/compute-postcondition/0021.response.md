Output State: The variable `c` will be 122 (ord('z')). The variable `char` remains unchanged from its initial value. The dictionary `mapping` will contain key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase English letter from 'a' to 'z', and each value is the initial value of `char`. This is because the loop iterates over every letter from 'a' to 'z', and for each letter, it checks if the letter is not already a value in the `mapping` dictionary. If not, it adds the letter as a key with `char` as its value and breaks out of the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the dictionary `mapping` will map every letter from 'a' to 'z' to the initial value of `char`, and `c` will have the final value of 122 (which is `ord('z')`).
