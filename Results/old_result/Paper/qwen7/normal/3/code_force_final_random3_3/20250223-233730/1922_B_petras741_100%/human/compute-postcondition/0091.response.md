Based on the initial state provided:

- `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from `range(n + 1)` for which `q[j] > 0`.
- `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, and it is explicitly stated that `eta_ln` is equal to 1.

This means that there is only one index `j` such that `q[j] > 0`.

Now, let's look at the expression being printed:

```python
print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
```

Given that `eta_ln` is 1, it implies that `eta` contains only one element. Therefore, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, but this value does not affect the expression being printed.

The expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` calculates the binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{3}\), which is the number of ways to choose 3 items from `n` items without regard to order. However, since `eta_ln` is 1, the value of `n` is not specified directly, but we know that the expression will evaluate to 0 because the formula requires at least 3 distinct elements to compute a non-zero value, and here we have only one.

Output: **0**
