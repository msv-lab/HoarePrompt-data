Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `i` is explicitly stated to be 1.
- `n` is stated to be greater than 1 but does not affect the print statement directly.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

This will print the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak` and `i`, repeated twice since `mak` and `i` are printed twice in the statement.

Output: **'? 0 0 1 1'**
