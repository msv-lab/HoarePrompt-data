Output State: **`i` is 0, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of length `l` containing `[0] * l`, `array` is a list of integers created from the input split, `ans` is an empty string.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` as an empty string. No changes are made to the values of `i`, `l`, `s`, or `array`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `ans` is set to an empty string.
