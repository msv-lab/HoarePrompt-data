Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: For each test case, the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are correctly initialized with the input values.
3. **Tent Calculation Logic**:
   - The program checks if the number of extroverts (`b`) cannot be fully accommodated with universals (`c`). Specifically, it checks if `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`. If this condition is met, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to find enough universals to form complete groups of 3 for the extroverts.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents required:
     - `a + (b + c) // 3`: This accounts for each introvert needing a separate tent and each group of 3 people (either extroverts or universals) needing one tent.
     - If `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, it means there are leftover people who need an additional tent, so `k` is incremented by 1.
4. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the total number of tents required for each test case.

Given the logic and the handling of edge cases, the program appears to be correct based on the problem statement and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
