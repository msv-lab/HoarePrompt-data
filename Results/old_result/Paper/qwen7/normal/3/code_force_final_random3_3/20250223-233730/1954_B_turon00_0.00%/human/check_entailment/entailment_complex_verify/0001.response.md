### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given array to make it non-beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` when `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if all elements in the array are the same using a set (`aa`). If they are, it prints `-1` because the array cannot be made non-beautiful.
   - It initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and uses a set `aa` to track unique elements.
   - It iterates through the array to count consecutive occurrences of the same element (`cnt`).
   - It updates the answer (`ans`) with the minimum count of consecutive occurrences found.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum count of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Key Points to Verify**:
   - The logic for checking if the array is already uniform (all elements the same) is correct.
   - The counting of consecutive occurrences and updating the answer seems to follow the requirement of making the array non-beautiful.
   - The solution correctly handles the constraints and examples provided.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array is already uniform, the solution correctly outputs `-1`.
   - The solution correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.

However, there are some issues with the implementation:

- **Incorrect Handling of Consecutive Occurrences**: The current implementation only counts consecutive occurrences starting from the first element (`tmp`). This means it might miss other potential sequences of consecutive identical elements in the array.
- **Set Usage**: The set `aa` is used to track unique elements, but it doesn't help in identifying the minimum number of elements to remove. Instead, it should focus on finding the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements.
- **Logic for Finding Minimum Removals**: The logic to find the minimum number of removals is flawed. It only considers the first occurrence of a different element and resets the count, which might not give the correct result.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Test Case 1**: `[2, 2, 2]`
  - The array is uniform, so the output should be `-1`. The program correctly outputs `-1`.

- **Test Case 2**: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`
  - The longest sequence of consecutive identical elements is `[1, 2, 1]` or `[2, 1, 2]`, which has a length of 3. The program outputs `1`, which is incorrect. It should output `3`.

- **Test Case 3**: `[1]`
  - The array is uniform, so the output should be `-1`. The program correctly outputs `-1`.

- **Test Case 4**: `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`
  - The longest sequence of consecutive identical elements is `[3, 3, 3]` or `[3, 3, 3]`, which has a length of 3. The program outputs `3`, which is correct.

### Correct Implementation:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements and then subtract this length from the total length of the array to get the minimum number of elements to remove.

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        max_count = 0
        current_count = 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i] == a[i-1]:
                current_count += 1
                max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            else:
                current_count = 1
        if max_count == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(n - max_count)
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was inaccurate due to the flawed logic for counting consecutive occurrences and determining the minimum number of elements to remove. The correct logic involves finding the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements and then calculating the difference between the total length and this maximum count.

### Final:
**False**
