Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `tmp` has some value, `a` is a list of integers.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` sets the value of `cnt` to 0. The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, which is now 0. The values of `i`, `n`, `tmp`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
