Output State: **`left` is 3, `right` must be at least 2, and `new_arr` contains either the element from `arr` at index 0 (if `left` is 1) or the elements `arr[right]` and `arr[left]` (if `left` is 2).**

Explanation: The value of `left` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The conditions for `right` and the definition of `new_arr` remain unchanged.
