Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `same` is 1.**

The code simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `same`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `ar`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
