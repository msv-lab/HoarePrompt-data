Postcondition: `total` is 10, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` becomes either `[i]` or `[0, i]` depending on the condition in the if statement, `maxi` is `n-1`, `res` is an input value from the user, `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'` if the loop executes `n-1` times, and `res` is set to '=' if the condition `res == '<'` is met.
