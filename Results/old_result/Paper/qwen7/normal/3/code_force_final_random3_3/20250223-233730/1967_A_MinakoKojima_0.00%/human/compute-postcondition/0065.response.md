Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the next positive integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is either the factorial of `n` or the cumulative product of the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a` starting from index 1 up to `n-1`, depending on whether `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, and `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is updated to a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged except that `a` is now updated to a list of integers.
