You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and arr is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9.

    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:

    #State: Output State: `left` is `n - 1`, `right` is 1, and `new_arr` is a list containing all elements from `arr` but in reverse order.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `left` will be equal to `right + 1`, which means `left` will be `n - 1` and `right` will be 1. During each iteration, the loop appends elements from the ends towards the center of the original array `arr` into `new_arr`. Therefore, `new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` in reverse order.
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `max_beauty` is increased by the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements from index 1 to `left + 1` in the `new_arr` list, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is equal to `left + 1`, and the values of `left`, `right`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged.
    #
    #To break it down further:
    #- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1` (where `n` is initially `left + 1`), adding the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]` to `max_beauty`.
    #- After all iterations, `max_beauty` will contain the total sum of these absolute differences.
    #- The values of `left`, `right`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
    #- `i` will be equal to `n` after the last iteration, which is `left + 1`.
    #- `n` will also be equal to `left + 1` after the loop completes.
    return max_beauty
    #The program returns max_beauty which is increased by the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements from index 1 to left + 1 in the new_arr list, where i is equal to n (which is left + 1), and the values of left, right, and new_arr remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `arr` of `n` integers (each integer in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9). It sorts the list `arr` and then creates a new list `new_arr` by appending elements from the ends of `arr` towards the center, resulting in `new_arr` containing all elements of `arr` in reverse order. Finally, it calculates `max_beauty` as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements from index 1 to `left + 1` in `new_arr`, where `left` is `n - 1`, and returns `max_beauty`. The values of `left`, `right`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged after the function execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. This means we want to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements.
   - It then calls a function `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty of the array.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function sorts the array `arr`.
   - It creates a new array `new_arr` where the smallest and largest elements are alternated to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.
   - Finally, it calculates the beauty of the new array by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest and largest values are placed at the extremes, maximizing the differences.
   - Alternating the smallest and largest values (starting with the smallest) ensures that the differences are maximized.
   - Summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array gives the maximum possible beauty.

Given this analysis, the code appears to be correct and should produce the expected results based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
