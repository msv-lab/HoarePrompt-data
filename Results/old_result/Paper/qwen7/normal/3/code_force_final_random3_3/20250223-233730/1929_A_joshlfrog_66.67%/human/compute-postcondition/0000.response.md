Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.**

This means that `t` now holds the value entered by the user, converted to an integer, and it is guaranteed to be within the range of 1 to 500. All other information about `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remains unchanged from the initial state.
