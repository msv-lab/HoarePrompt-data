Reasoning:

1. The problem requires calculating the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts under the given pricing conditions.
2. The annotated program correctly handles the logic for different scenarios:
   - If `n` is odd, it checks whether buying two yogurts at the promotional price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying one yogurt at the regular price (`a`). If so, it uses the promotional price for pairs and the regular price for the last yogurt.
   - If `n` is even, it directly compares the total cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price (`a * n`) with the promotional price for half the yogurts (`n // 2 * b`).
3. The program processes each test case individually and prints the minimum cost for each case.
4. The logic in the program matches the problem statement and examples provided.

Given the analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
