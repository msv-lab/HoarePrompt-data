Output State: **`left` is 2; `right` must be at least 2; `new_arr` contains the elements `arr[right]` and `arr[left]`**

Explanation: The code appends `arr[left]` to `new_arr`. Given the initial state, `left` is 2, and `new_arr` already contains `arr[right]`. After executing the code, `new_arr` will now contain both `arr[right]` and `arr[2]`. The values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged, and the condition that `right` must be at least 2 still holds.
