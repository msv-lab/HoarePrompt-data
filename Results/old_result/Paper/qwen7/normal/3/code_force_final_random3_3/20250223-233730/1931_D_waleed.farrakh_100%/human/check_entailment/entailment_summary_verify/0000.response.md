### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to verify its correctness based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the number of beautiful pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) in an array \(a\) such that:
  1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
  2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

#### Function 1 Analysis (`func_1`):
```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        freq = {}
        count = 0
        for a in arr:
            rx = (-a % x + x) % x
            ry = a % y
            if (rx, ry) in freq:
                count += freq[rx, ry]
            current_pair = (a % x, a % y)
            if current_pair in freq:
                freq[current_pair] += 1
            else:
                freq[current_pair] = 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

1. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of pairs \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\).
   - For each element \(a_i\), it computes the remainders `rx` and `ry` using modulo operations.
   - It checks if the pair \((rx, ry)\) already exists in the dictionary. If it does, it adds the count of such pairs to the total count `count`.

2. **Modulo Operations**:
   - The expression `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `rx` is always non-negative, which is important for the logic to work correctly.

3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The program correctly counts pairs \((i, j)\) such that both conditions are satisfied.

#### Function 2 Analysis (`func_2`):
```python
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    t = int(data[0])
    test_cases = []
    idx = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, data[idx].split())
        arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))
        test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
        idx += 2
    results = func_1(test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The function reads input from standard input, processes it, and passes it to `func_1`.
   - It handles multiple test cases efficiently by splitting the input into individual test cases.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - The function constructs the test cases and passes them to `func_1`.
   - It then prints the results returned by `func_1`.

#### Verification:
- The program correctly implements the logic to find beautiful pairs.
- The frequency calculation and counting mechanism are sound.
- The input reading and processing are handled correctly.

Given the problem description and the examples provided, the program correctly identifies and counts the beautiful pairs according to the criteria specified. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array.
