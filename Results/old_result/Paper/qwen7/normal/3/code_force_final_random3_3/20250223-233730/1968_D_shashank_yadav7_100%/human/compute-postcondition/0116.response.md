Output State: **`k` is an integer, `b` is `int(input())`, `s` is `int(input())`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] + sp + n * a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp + n * a[b]`, `i` is `n + 1`, and either `bm` is greater than `sm` or `bm` is less than or equal to `sm` after the if-else block executes.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `b` from the input and assigns them to the respective variables. The values of `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, and `i` remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition within the if-else block does not affect the values of these variables since no further changes are made to them after the input assignment.
