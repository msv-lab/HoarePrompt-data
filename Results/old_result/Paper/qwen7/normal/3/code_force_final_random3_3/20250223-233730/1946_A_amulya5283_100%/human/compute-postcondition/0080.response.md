Output State: **t is equal to 0, n is an input integer, a is a sorted list of integers, and res is the count of consecutive occurrences of the middle element (a[mdx]) from the middle index towards the end of the list a. mdx is calculated as n // 2 + n % 2 - 1, and i is the last index value that was checked in the loop.**

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- `t` is reduced to 0 because it starts as a positive integer and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.
- `n` remains as the last input integer received.
- `a` is the sorted list of integers provided as input.
- `res` holds the count of how many times the middle element (`a[mdx]`) appears consecutively from the middle index (`mdx`) to the end of the list `a`.
- `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, which determines the middle index of the list `a`.
- `i` is the last index value that was checked in the loop, which would be `n - 1` since the loop iterates from `mdx` to `n - 1`.
