Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer, and its current value is less than `a` and greater than `b`.

We need to evaluate the expression `2 + m // b` where `m // b` represents integer division of `m` by `b`.

Given that `m` is an integer such that `b < m < a`, the value of `m // b` will be at least 1 because `m` is greater than `b`. Therefore, the expression `2 + m // b` will be at least 3.

To summarize, the print statement will output the result of the expression `2 + m // b`, where `m` is an integer between `b` and `a`.

Output: **2 + m // b (where m is an integer such that b < m < a)**
