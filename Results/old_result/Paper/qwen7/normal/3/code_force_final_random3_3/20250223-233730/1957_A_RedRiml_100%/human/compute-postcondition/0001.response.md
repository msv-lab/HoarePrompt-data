State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `w` must be greater than 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `w`, which is used as the range parameter in `range(w)`.
2. For the loop to execute, `w` must be a positive integer because `range(w)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `w-1`.
3. The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop condition and does not affect whether the loop can execute, so it does not need to be adjusted.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `w` to ensure it is greater than 0.
