Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed directly to the next iteration. Since there is no loop specified in the initial state, we assume this is part of a loop context. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the program continues with the next iteration of the loop.
