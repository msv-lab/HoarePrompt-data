Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice' with 'Draw' appended, `i` is 4, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The initial state of `test_cases` being greater than 3 remains unchanged. The value of `i` is updated to 4 because the loop or conditional block that increments `i` by 1 (likely a `for` loop starting from 3) has completed one iteration. The `clues` list remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet.
