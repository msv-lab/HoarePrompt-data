Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 6, `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be 6 (since the loop increments `i` starting from 3 up to `n`), and `n` must be at least 6 for the loop to complete all its iterations. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
