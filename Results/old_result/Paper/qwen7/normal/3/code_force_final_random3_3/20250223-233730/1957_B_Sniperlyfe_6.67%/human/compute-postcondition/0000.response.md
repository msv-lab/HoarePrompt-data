Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5; `nums` is a list of n zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `nums` with `n` elements, all set to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or any other variables. Therefore, the conditions for `t`, `n`, `k`, and the sum constraint remain unchanged, while `nums` is now a list of `n` zeros.
