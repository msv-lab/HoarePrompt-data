Output State: **`max_diff` is `diff`, `next_max_diff` is equal to `max_diff`, `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred (or None if not applicable), `i` is 5.**

Explanation: The code sets `max_diff` to the value of `diff`. Since `diff` is defined as `A[5] - A[4]`, `max_diff` now holds this value. The other variables (`next_max_diff`, `index`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
