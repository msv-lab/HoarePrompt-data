Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `(v1, v2) in ops[::-1]`. This means that `v1` and `v2` are the variables being iterated over, and `ops[::-1]` is the sequence from which they are taken.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `ops`**: Since `ops` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we need to infer its initial state based on the given information about `vx`.

3. **Understand the Content of `vx`**: `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, which are the last two integers from the original set from 1 to `n`. This implies that `vx` contains the integers `n-1` and `n`.

4. **Infer the Content of `ops`**: Given that `ops` is likely constructed from `vx`, and considering the structure of the loop, `ops` should contain pairs of elements from `vx`. Since `vx` contains `n-1` and `n`, `ops` could be something like `[(n-1, n)]` or similar, but without more context, we assume the simplest form.

5. **Determine the Initial Values of `v1` and `v2`**: Since `ops` is reversed (`ops[::-1]`), the first pair in `ops` would be the last pair in the original order. Therefore, if `ops` is `[(n-1, n)]`, then the first pair in the reversed order is still `(n-1, n)`. Thus, `v1` and `v2` would initially be `n-1` and `n` respectively.

6. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the initial state of `ops` allows the loop to start. Since `ops` is constructed from `vx`, and `vx` contains `n-1` and `n`, `ops` should contain at least one pair. 

Given these points, the state before the loop starts should be:

- `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, which are the last two integers from the original set from 1 to `n`.
- `ops` is a list containing at least one pair of elements from `vx`, specifically the last two integers from the original set from 1 to `n`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:

**`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, which are the last two integers from the original set from 1 to `n`, `ops` is a list containing at least one pair of elements from `vx`, specifically the last two integers from the original set from 1 to `n`, `v1` is `n-1`, and `v2` is `n`.**

However, since the exact content of `ops` is not specified, we can simplify it to:

**`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, which are the last two integers from the original set from 1 to `n`, `ops` is a list containing at least one pair of elements from `vx`, `v1` is `n-1`, and `v2` is `n`.**

For clarity, we can write it as:

**`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, which are the last two integers from the original set from 1 to `n`, `ops` is a list containing at least one pair of elements from `vx`, `v1` is `n-1`, and `v2` is `n`.**

So, the final state is:

**`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, which are the last two integers from the original set from 1 to `n`, `ops` is a list containing at least one pair of elements from `vx`, `v1` is `n-1`, and `v2` is `n`.**
