Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer such that 1 <= cases <= 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `lex = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `lex`. The values of `cases` and `i` remain unchanged, and `arr` remains an empty list.
