Postcondition: `x` is an integer and equal to the previous value of `x` plus 1, `rev_val` is a list, and `rev_res` is a string. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is updated by appending the string representation of `val_in`, where `val_in` is `rev_val[x]`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is updated by concatenating the reverse of the string representation of `val_in`, where `val_in` is `rev_val[x]`, and `x` is incremented by 1.
