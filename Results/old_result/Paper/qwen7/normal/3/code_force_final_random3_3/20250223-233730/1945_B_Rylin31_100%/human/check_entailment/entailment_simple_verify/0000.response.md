### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the given program step-by-step.

#### Problem Description:
We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time. Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes, and from the second installation every `b` minutes. Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

#### Annotated Code:
- Before the function call, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b, m \leq 10^{18}\).
- The loop processes `t` iterations, reading three integers (`a`, `b`, `m`) from the user input and printing the result of `m // a + m // b + 2`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Initial Assumption**: The original assessment claimed that the formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is incorrect because it does not account for overlapping launches correctly.
2. **Manual Calculation Example**:
   - For `a = 6`, `b = 7`, and `m = 4`:
     - `m // a = 0` (no launches from the first installation within the first 4 minutes).
     - `m // b = 0` (no launches from the second installation within the first 4 minutes).
     - Adding `2` gives `2`.
     - This seems correct for this specific case.
   - For `a = 3`, `b = 4`, and `m = 10`:
     - `10 // 3 = 3` (launches at 0, 3, 6, 9).
     - `10 // 4 = 2` (launches at 0, 4, 8).
     - Adding `2` gives `7`.
     - This also seems correct for this specific case.

3. **Overlap Consideration**:
   - The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` counts the number of launches from each installation separately and adds 2 for the initial launches.
   - However, it does not account for the fact that some launches might overlap, meaning a firework from one installation might coincide with a firework from the other installation.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine when both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
   - We then need to count the number of unique times both installations launch fireworks within the visibility period `m`.

#### Correct Formula:
The correct approach involves finding the LCM of `a` and `b` and then determining the number of unique launch times within the visibility period `m`.

#### Revised Program:
```python
import math

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // math.gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        l = lcm(a, b)
        count = (m // a) + (m // b) - (m // l) + 2
        print(count)
```

#### Final Evaluation:
Given the revised understanding and the corrected approach, the original assessment was inaccurate. The original program does not handle the overlaps correctly, but the provided solution in the annotated code and the revised program do address this issue.

**Final: False**
