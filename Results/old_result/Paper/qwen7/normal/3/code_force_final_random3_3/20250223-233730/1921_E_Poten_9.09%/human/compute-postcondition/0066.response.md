Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or ['Draw', 'Bob'], `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces. The first clue is not equal to 1, the third clue is less than or equal to the fifth clue, and either both the third and fifth clues are even numbers or both are odd numbers. Additionally, the third clue is not equal to the fifth clue. Depending on the condition inside the if statement, either `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`. If the condition is true, `answers` will contain 'Draw'; otherwise, `answers` will contain 'Bob'. If the condition is false, `answers` is set to either ['Draw'], ['Bob'], or ['Draw', 'Bob'] based on the absolute difference between the third and fifth clues being greater than 1 or other specified conditions involving the differences between the second and fourth clues and the third and fifth clues.
