Output State: **`ans` is now a list containing one additional element which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `a` retains its original value, `j` is `j + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to the list `ans`. The value of `ans` is updated with this new element, while the original list `a` remains unchanged. Additionally, the value of `j` is incremented by 1.
