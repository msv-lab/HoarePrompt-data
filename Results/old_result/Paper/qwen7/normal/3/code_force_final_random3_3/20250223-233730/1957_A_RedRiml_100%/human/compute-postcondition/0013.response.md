Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a non-empty list of integers, `pl` is a list with at least one element, `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was `1`, then `d[i]` remains `1`. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1, and `i` is not in `pl`.
