Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 1
- `n` is 1
- `done` is True
- `count` is 1

The `string` variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value directly from the given information. Since no value or formula for `string` is provided, we must assume that `string` is a variable that holds a specific value or expression that is not defined in the initial state.

Given the lack of information about `string`, the most precise description we can provide is that `string` is a variable whose value is not specified in the initial state.

Output: **string (where string is a variable whose value is not specified in the initial state)**
