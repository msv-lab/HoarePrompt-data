Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is 3, `x` is an input string, `a` and `b` are determined based on the characters in the string `x`, and `b[j]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 3, `b[3]` is incremented by 1. The values of `i`, `j`, `x`, `a`, and the relationship between `b[i]` and `b[j]` remain unchanged from the initial state.
