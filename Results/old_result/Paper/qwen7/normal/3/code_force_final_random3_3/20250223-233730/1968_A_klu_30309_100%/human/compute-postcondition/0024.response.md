Output State: **`max_sum` remains unchanged, `best_y` remains unchanged, `x` retains its original value, `y` is decremented by 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y-1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (y-1)**.

This means that `current_sum` is calculated as the sum of `gcd_val` and the new value of `y` (which is `y-1`). All other variables retain their initial states.
