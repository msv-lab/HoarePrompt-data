Output State: **`max_diff` is `-inf`, `next_max_diff` is `diff`, `index` is `None`, `A` is assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` retain their original values from `func_4()`.**

Explanation: The line `next_max_diff = diff` updates the value of `next_max_diff` to be equal to the current value of `diff`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
