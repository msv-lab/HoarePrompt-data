### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the position `n` and the number `x` Vasya received.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function computes the divisors of `n` and yields them one by one.
   - It performs prime factorization and generates all possible products of these prime factors.
   - The function correctly computes the divisors of `n`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic checks for valid `k` values using the following steps:
     - Calculate `h = n - x` and find divisors of `h` that are even and satisfy the condition `k / 2 + 1 >= x`.
     - If `x != 1`, calculate `h = n + x - 2` and find divisors of `h` that are even and satisfy the same condition.
     - Union the sets of valid `k` values from both calculations.
     - Print the size of the union set, which represents the number of valid `k` values.

4. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The condition `k / 2 + 1 >= x` ensures that the number `x` falls within the range of the settling pattern.
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where `x` is 1 separately.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case when `x` is 1 by checking it explicitly before processing the general case.
   - The program correctly handles the case when `k = 1` is not considered since the settling does not exist for `k = 1`.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid `k` values based on the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly implements the required functionality.

### Correctness:
**True**
