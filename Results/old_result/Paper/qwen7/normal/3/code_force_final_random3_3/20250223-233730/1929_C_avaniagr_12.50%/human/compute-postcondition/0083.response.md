Output State: `i` is equal to `x + 1`, `x` can be any value as long as it is greater than or equal to 5, `z` is the result of repeatedly applying the operation `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 1 to `x + 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be `x + 1`, `x` can be any value starting from 5 or higher, and `z` will be the final value obtained after performing the operation `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 1 to `x + 1`.
