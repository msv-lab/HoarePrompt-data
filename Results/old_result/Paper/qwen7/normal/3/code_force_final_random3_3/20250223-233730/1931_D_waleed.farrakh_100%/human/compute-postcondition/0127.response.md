The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the size of the array), `x` and `y` (two integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array). Each element in `arr` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.

After processing all the test cases, the function returns a list named 'results' which contains the cumulative sum of 'count' values computed over all iterations of the loop. Additionally, the list includes the final states of 'freq', 'rx', 'ry', and 'current_pair' from the last iteration.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter test_cases, which is a list of tuples containing n, x, y, and arr. It processes each tuple to compute count values and returns a list of cumulative sums of these counts along with the final states of freq, rx, ry, and current_pair.**
