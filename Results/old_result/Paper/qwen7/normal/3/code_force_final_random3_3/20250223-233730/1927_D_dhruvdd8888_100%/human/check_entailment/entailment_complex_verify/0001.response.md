### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided annotated code and the original assessment. We'll focus on ensuring that the program correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical numbers and handles queries appropriately.

1. **Segment Identification:**
   - The program correctly identifies segments where the value changes in the array `nums`. However, appending `-1` to `nums` is unnecessary because the loop naturally handles the last segment.
   - The logic to store segments in `arr` is correct, but we can simplify it slightly.

2. **Query Handling:**
   - The use of binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the relevant segment in `arr` is appropriate.
   - The conditions to check if the segment lies within the query range and to determine the output are mostly correct but can be simplified.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle edge cases where the entire segment is within the query range without needing further checks.
   - The logic for determining the output when no distinct elements are found could be more straightforward.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Segment Identification:**
   - The current logic to identify segments is correct, but we can simplify it by removing the unnecessary append of `-1` to `nums`.

2. **Query Handling:**
   - The conditions to check if the segment lies within the query range and to determine the output are mostly correct but can be simplified.

### Simplified and Corrected Implementation

Here is a simplified and corrected version of the program:

```python
from bisect import bisect_left

def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    arr = []
    prev_num = nums[0]
    start = 0
    
    # Identify segments where the value changes
    for i in range(N):
        if nums[i] != prev_num:
            arr.append((start, i, prev_num))
            start = i
        prev_num = nums[i]
    
    # Append the last segment
    arr.append((start, N, prev_num))
    
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (l, r) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        if eli == LA and arr[eli][1] < r:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            (s, e, _) = arr[eli]
            if s <= l and e >= r:
                print(-1, -1)
            elif s < l and e >= r:
                print(l, l + 1)
            elif s <= l and e < r:
                print(s, e + 1)
            else:
                print(-1, -1)

# Main loop for test cases
tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()
```

### Conclusion

After reviewing and simplifying the code, the program appears to handle the problem correctly. The original program is indeed correct.

**Correctness:** True

**Final:** True
