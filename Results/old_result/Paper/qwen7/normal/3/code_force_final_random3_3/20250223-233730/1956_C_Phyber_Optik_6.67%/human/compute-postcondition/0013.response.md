Output State: **`sum` is either 0 + n * (n + 1) // 2 or 2 * n, depending on whether the condition n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n holds true; `i` is 2; `r` is 2.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The conditions and values of `sum`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from the initial state.
