Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is equal to `t`; `m` is the second integer input split from the same input line; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`; `k` is not a power of two and `k` is even; `l` is a string representation of the binary form of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `p` is the length of `l`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the binary representation of `k` (stored in `p`). Since `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `k` is even and not a power of two, the binary representation of `k` will have at least two '1's and will not be a single '1' followed by zeros (which would indicate a power of two). The value of `p` is determined by the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
