Output State: **`i` is 0; `t` must be greater than 0; `string` is an input string; `s` is a list of characters from the input string.**

The code `s = list(string)` converts the input string into a list of its characters. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged. The variable `string` is still an input string, and `s` now holds a list containing each character of the input string as an element.
