Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `N` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers with an additional element -1 appended to it, `s` is `N + 1`, `e` is 0, `num` is the value of `nums[N]`, `arr` is a list containing up to `N` tuples, each of the form `(1 + i, i, num_i)` where `num_i` is the value of `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, and `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the list `arr` and subtracts 1 from it, storing the result in `LA`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `N`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `nums`, `s`, `e`, and `num` remain unchanged, and the list `arr` retains its structure as described.
