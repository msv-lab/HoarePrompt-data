Output State: **`suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is a suit and the value is either `None` or a rank, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the initial state, we assume that the `continue` statement is part of a loop that is not explicitly mentioned. The `suits` dictionary remains unchanged, and the loop continues to the next iteration.
