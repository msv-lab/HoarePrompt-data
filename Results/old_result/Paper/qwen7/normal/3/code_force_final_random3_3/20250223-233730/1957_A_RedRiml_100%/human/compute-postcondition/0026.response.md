Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a non-empty list of integers with `i` being the third element, `pl` is a list containing at least one element `i` with `i` appended, `d[i]` is equal to 1 for each key `i` not in `pl` before the if statement, and `d[i]` remains 1 for keys already in `pl`.**

Explanation: The given code snippet does not contain any executable statements. Therefore, no changes are made to the variables. The only statement provided is `d[i] = 1`, which sets the value of `d[i]` to 1 for the specified key `i`. However, since no further operations are performed, the values of other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
