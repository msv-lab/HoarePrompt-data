Output State: **`t` is now greater than 0 - 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the input split, `x` is the integer value of the second element of the input split, `y` is the integer value of the third element of the input split, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from converting the first `x` elements of the input split into integers.**

Explanation: The code `arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]` iterates over the first `x` elements of the list `arr` (which are originally strings) and converts each of them to an integer. The resulting list is assigned back to `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
