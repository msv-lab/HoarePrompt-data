The loop condition is `l < h`. For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must still hold true. At the end of the previous iteration, `l` and `h` remain unchanged, and the condition `l < h` must still hold true.

Since no adjustments are needed to `l` and `h` to maintain the condition `l < h`, and no other variables in the loop head are relevant, the states do not need to be modified.

State: **`mid_sum` is updated to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is updated to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `ans` remains unchanged, `l` and `h` remain unchanged, `mid` remains unchanged, `left` remains unchanged, `right` remains unchanged, `f` remains unchanged, `D` remains unchanged, and `l < h` must still hold true.**
