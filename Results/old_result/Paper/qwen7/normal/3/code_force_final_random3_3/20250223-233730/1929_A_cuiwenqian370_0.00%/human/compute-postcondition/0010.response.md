Output State: **`arr` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `new_arr` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `arr[left]` and the second element is `arr[right]`, `left` is 0, `right` is n - 1, and `left` is not equal to `right`.**

Explanation: The code appends `arr[left]` to `new_arr`. Initially, `new_arr` contains only `arr[right]`. After appending `arr[left]`, `new_arr` now contains two elements: `arr[left]` and `arr[right]`. The values of `left`, `right`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
