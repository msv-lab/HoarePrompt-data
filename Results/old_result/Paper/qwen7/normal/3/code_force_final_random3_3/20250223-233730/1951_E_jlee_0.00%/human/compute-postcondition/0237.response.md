Postcondition: `s` is a string, `j` is an index within the string, `done` is set to True, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if the character at index `j` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is equal to `j`, and the current value of `count` is greater than 0, and the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`.
