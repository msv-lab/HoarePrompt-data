Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `N`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the values are:
   - `i` is 2
   - `N` is between 2 and 200000 inclusive
   - `s` is 2 (not part of the loop head)
   - `arr` contains two elements: \([(1, 1, 0), (2, 2, num)]\)
   - `num` is assigned the value `nums[2]` (not part of the loop head)

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < N + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `N + 1`.

4. **Update the State**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - `N` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Final State**: The updated state should reflect the new value of `i` and keep `N` within its original range.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `N` is between 2 and 200000 inclusive, `s` is 2, `arr` contains two elements \([(1, 1, 0), (2, 2, num)]\), `num` is assigned the value `nums[2]`**
