Postcondition: `done` remains `False` or becomes `True`, `i` is incremented by 1 (new value is `i_new`), `j` is the next value in the sequence (either 0 or 1), `count` is equal to `j`, `count2` is either 1, 2, or equal to `count`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`, no change occurs; if `count2` equals `count`, `done` remains `False` and `count2` is reset to 0; if `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` becomes `True` and the loop or if statement is exited. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1.
