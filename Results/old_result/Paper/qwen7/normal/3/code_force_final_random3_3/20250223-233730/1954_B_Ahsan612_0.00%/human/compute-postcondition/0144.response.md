Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it calculates the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the array \( a \). If no such sequence exists, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the minimum count. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
