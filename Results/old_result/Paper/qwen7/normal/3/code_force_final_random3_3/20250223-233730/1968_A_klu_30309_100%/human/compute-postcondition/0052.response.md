Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `y`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `y` is within the specified range (`x - 1` to `0`).

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`
   - `best_y` is `y`
   - `results` list still contains 1
   - `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`
   - `y` is `y - 1`
   - `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`
   - The most internal loop or if statement is exited.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `y` in reverse from `x - 1` to `0`, the next value of `y` will be `y - 1` (if `y` was `x - 2` before, it will now be `x - 3`).
   - All other variables remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `y - 1`, `results` list still contains 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y - 1`, `y` is `y - 1 - 1` (i.e., `y - 2`), `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (y - 1)`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
