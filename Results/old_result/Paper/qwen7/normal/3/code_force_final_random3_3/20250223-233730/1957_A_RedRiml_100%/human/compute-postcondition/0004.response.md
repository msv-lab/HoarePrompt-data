Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `pl` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `pl`. The values of `t`, `w`, `ln`, and `palka` remain unchanged from their initial state.
