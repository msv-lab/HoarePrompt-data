Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `ans` is `k * b + (n - k) * a`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` was initially set to `k * b`. After executing the line `ans += (n - k) * a`, the value of `ans` is updated to include `(n - k) * a`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `k * b + (n - k) * a`. The values of `t`, `k`, `b`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
