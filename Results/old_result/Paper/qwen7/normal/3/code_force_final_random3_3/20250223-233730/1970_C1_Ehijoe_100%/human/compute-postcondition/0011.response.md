Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory list, `i` is 3, `nodes[v]` includes `u`**

Explanation: The code appends `u` to the list associated with `v` in the `nodes` dictionary. Initially, `nodes[u]` includes `v`. After executing the code, `nodes[v]` will include both `u` and `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
