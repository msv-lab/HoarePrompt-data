Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.

### Initial State Before the Loop
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is equal to `t`
- `m` is the second integer input split from the same input line
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`
- `k` is not a power of two and `k` is even
- `l` is the string representation of the binary form of `k` without the '0b' prefix
- `p` is the length of `l`
- `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\)
- `f` is `k - q`

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```python
while f & f - 1 != 0:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Understanding the Loop Condition
The loop continues as long as `f & (f - 1)` is not equal to 0. This expression checks if `f` has more than one bit set in its binary representation. In other words, the loop continues if `f` is not a power of two.

### Analyzing the Variables
We need to ensure that `f` is not a power of two for the loop to execute the first time. Let's analyze each variable:

1. **`t`**: The value of `t` does not directly affect `f`, so no adjustment is needed here.
2. **`n`**: Since `n` is equal to `t`, no adjustment is needed here either.
3. **`m`**: The value of `m` affects `k`, but since `m` is an input, we cannot change it directly. We need to ensure that `k` is not a power of two and is even.
4. **`k`**: `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and it must be even and not a power of two. To ensure this, we need to make sure that `k` meets these conditions.
5. **`l`**: This is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix. It is derived from `k`, so no direct adjustment is needed.
6. **`p`**: This is the length of `l`, derived from `k`, so no direct adjustment is needed.
7. **`q`**: This is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), derived from `k`, so no direct adjustment is needed.
8. **`f`**: This is `k - q`, and it must not be a power of two for the loop to execute.

### Ensuring `f` is Not a Power of Two
To ensure `f` is not a power of two, `k` must be an even number that is not a power of two. Since `k` is already given to be even and not a power of two, the only thing we need to ensure is that `k` remains even and not a power of two.

### Conclusion
Since `k` is already given to be even and not a power of two, no adjustments are needed to the states of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `q`, or `f`. The loop will execute the first time based on the given conditions.

### Final Answer
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is equal to `t`; `m` is the second integer input split from the same input line; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`; `k` is not a power of two and `k` is even; `l` is the string representation of the binary form of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `p` is the length of `l`; `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\); `f` is `k - q`**
