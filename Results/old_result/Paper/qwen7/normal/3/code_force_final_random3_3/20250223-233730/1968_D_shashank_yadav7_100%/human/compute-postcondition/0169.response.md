Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n + 1`, where `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is 0.
- `b` is `p[b] - 2`.
- `s` is `p[s] - 2`.
- `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp + a[s]`.
- `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`.
- `bp` is `bp + 2 * a[b]`.
- `sp` is `sp + 2 * a[s]`.
- `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.

The print statement is `print('Draw')`.

Given the information, none of the variables mentioned in the print statement (`i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sm`, `bm`, `bp`, `sp`) are directly used in the print statement. The only string being printed is `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
