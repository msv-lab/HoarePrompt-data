Postcondition: **`suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is a suit and the value is either `None` or a rank; `answers` is a list with either one or two elements where the first element is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop(){trump}', the second element is a new string formatted as '{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}' if the if condition is met, `trumps` is a list with one element less than before, and the program returns None if the else condition is met.**
