Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `l` is an integer less than `h`, and `h` must be greater than `l`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `D[mid] + f` to `mid_sum` and `D[mid + 1] + f` to `mid_next_sum`. Here, `mid` is initially defined as `l + (h - l) // 2`. The values of `l` and `h` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the given code snippet. Therefore, the updated states of the variables are as mentioned above.
