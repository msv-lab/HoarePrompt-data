Output State: **`tree` now contains the current element `nodes[curr][0]`, `prev` is now equal to `nodes[curr][0]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` to the first child of the current node (`nodes[curr][0]`). Since the first child of `curr` is not equal to `prev`, `prev` is updated to the new value of `curr`.
