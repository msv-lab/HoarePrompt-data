Postcondition: `done` is `True`, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with the first character assigned to `x`, `n` is 1, `count` is 1, `count2` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1. If `count` is greater than 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]`. Otherwise, `count2` is set to 0 and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
