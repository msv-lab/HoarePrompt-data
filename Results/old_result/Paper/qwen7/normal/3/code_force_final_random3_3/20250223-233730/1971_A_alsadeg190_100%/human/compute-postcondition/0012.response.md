Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is 1.
- `x` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `y` is an integer from the split input, and it is assigned the value of the second integer from the input.

The `print(y, x)` statement will print the value of `y` followed by the value of `x`.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` depend on the input, we cannot specify their exact values without knowing the input. However, we know that `y` is the second integer from the input and `x` is the first integer from the input.

Output: **y, x (where y is the second integer from the input and x is the first integer from the input)**
