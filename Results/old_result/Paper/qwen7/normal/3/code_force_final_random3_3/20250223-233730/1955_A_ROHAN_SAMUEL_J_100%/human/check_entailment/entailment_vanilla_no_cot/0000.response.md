Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a flaw in its logic when determining the minimum cost. Let's analyze the given code:

1. The code checks if `n` is odd or even.
2. If `n` is odd, it compares `2 * a` with `b` to decide whether to buy all yogurts individually or use the promotion as much as possible.
3. If `n` is even, it directly compares `2 * a` with `b` to decide whether to buy all yogurts in pairs or individually.

However, the logic does not correctly handle the scenario where the promotion is cheaper than buying each yogurt individually, especially when `n` is odd. Here's an improved version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost if all yogurts are bought individually
        individual_cost = n * a
        # Calculate the cost if yogurts are bought in pairs as much as possible
        pair_cost = ((n // 2) * b) + ((n % 2) * a)
        # Print the minimum of the two costs
        print(min(individual_cost, pair_cost))
```

This version ensures that the minimum cost is calculated correctly for both even and odd values of `n`.
