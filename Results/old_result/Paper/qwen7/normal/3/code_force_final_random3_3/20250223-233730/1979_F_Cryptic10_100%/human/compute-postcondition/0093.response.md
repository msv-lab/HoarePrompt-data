Output State: **`vx` has at least 2 elements (since one element was removed), `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)`, `p1` is an empty set, `p2` is an empty set, `v1` is the third last element of `vx`, `v2` is the second last element of `vx`, and the current value of `v2` is greater than 0**.

Explanation: The line `ops += [(v1, v2)]` appends the tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. The values of `vx`, `p1`, `p2`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only change is that `ops` now contains the tuple `(v1, v2)`.
