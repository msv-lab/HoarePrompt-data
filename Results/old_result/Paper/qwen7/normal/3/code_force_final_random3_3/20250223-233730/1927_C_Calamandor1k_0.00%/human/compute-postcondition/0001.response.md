Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` and the value `t`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since the loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, the loop will run `t` times.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `t`**: According to the given information, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive), and it is set to the integer input received.

4. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute**: For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is set to the integer input received, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being a positive integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer**
