Output State: **`j` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `cnt` is the count of elements in list `b` that are less than the element `a[i]`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and converts each integer to an int, then creates a list `a` with these integers. The values of `j`, `n`, and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial state, except that `n` is now an input integer (which could be different from its initial value). The list `a` is created based on the user's input.
