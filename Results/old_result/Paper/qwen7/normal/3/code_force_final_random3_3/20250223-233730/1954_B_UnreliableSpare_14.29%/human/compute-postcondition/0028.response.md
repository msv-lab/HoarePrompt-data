Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `arr` is a list of integers, and the element at index `i` in `arr` is not equal to `val`.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated to be the smaller of its current value and `cnt`. The conditions on `arr` and the element at index `i` remain unchanged.
