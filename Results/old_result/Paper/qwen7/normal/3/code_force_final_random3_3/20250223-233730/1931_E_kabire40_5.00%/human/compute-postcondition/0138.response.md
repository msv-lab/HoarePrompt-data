Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `x` will be equal to the last index of `operational_list`, `x_rev` will be the integer value of the reverse of the last element in `operational_list`. `rev_res` will be a string containing all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed form has the same length as the original element, concatenated together. `rev_val` will be a list containing the reversed forms of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed form has a different length than the original element.**

This means that after the loop completes, `x` will have iterated through each element in `operational_list`, starting from the first element. For each element, its reverse (`x_rev`) is calculated, and based on the condition (whether the length of the reversed string matches the original), either `rev_res` is updated by concatenating the original element or `rev_val` is updated with the reversed element.
