Output State: **`smallest` is 2, `heap` is now a list containing [4, 4, 5], `median_index` is 1, `current_median` is 4, `operations` is increased by 2**.

The code `operations += 1` increments the value of `operations` by 1. Initially, `operations` was increased by 1, so after this line of code, `operations` is increased by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
