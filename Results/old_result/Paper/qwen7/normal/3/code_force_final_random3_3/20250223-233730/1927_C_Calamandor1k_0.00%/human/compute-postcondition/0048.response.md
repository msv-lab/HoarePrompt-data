Output State: **`t` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: Initially, `t` is `t + 1`. After executing the code, `t` becomes 2. The code then takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. Since the actual input values are not specified, they are represented as "an input integer".
