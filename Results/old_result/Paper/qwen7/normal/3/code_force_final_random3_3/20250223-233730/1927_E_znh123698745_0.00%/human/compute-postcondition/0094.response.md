Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `answer` will contain the list `[1, 2, 3, ..., n-1]`. This is because the loop iterates `n-1` times, and during each iteration, it appends elements from the `array` list to `answer` based on the conditions provided. Since `a` starts with `[1, -1]` and the loop continues to update `a` based on the parity of `i`, the elements from the `array` list will be appended to `answer` in a sequential manner, starting from 1 up to `n-1`.

The final `answer` will be a list of length `n-1`, containing all integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive, in ascending order.
