Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies the variables involved in the loop. In this case, the loop head involves `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mak` is 1
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - The input is a string equal to '<'

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop continues as long as `i < n`, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration (assuming the loop body does not change `i` or `n`).
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 2.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `mak` remains unchanged at 1.
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - The input remains a string equal to '<'.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`mak` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, and the input is a string equal to '<'**
