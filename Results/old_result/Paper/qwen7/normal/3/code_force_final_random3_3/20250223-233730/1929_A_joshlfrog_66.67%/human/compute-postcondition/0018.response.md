Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `e` is 0, `l` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `x` is the value of `nums[i]`, and `y` is the minimum value between the original `y` and `nums[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `x = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `x`. The value of `i` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `x`. However, we know that `x` now holds the value of the element at index `i` in the list `nums`. The other variables (`t`, `e`, `l`, `nums`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
