Output State: **`c` is increased by 1, `ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is `n-1`, `r` is decreased by 1.**

In this step, the value of `r` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`c`, `ans`, `res`, `k`, `l`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
