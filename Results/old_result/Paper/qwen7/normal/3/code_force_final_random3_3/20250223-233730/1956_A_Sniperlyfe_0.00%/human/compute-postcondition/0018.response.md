Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable involved here is `t`, but since `t` is a constant and does not change within the loop, it remains the same throughout the loop iterations.

2. **Understand the loop body behavior**: The loop body processes elements from `qs` and appends the results of `func_1(n, p)` to `res`. After processing all elements in `qs`, `qs` becomes empty.

3. **Determine the final state after the loop**: According to the problem statement, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged. The lists `p` and `qs` will be empty since all elements have been processed. The list `res` will contain the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in the original `qs`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**: Since the loop is about to start its first iteration, the state should reflect the initial conditions before the loop starts. Therefore, `t`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged, and `p` and `qs` are still populated with their initial values.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers (with all elements remaining)**.
