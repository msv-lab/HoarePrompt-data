Reasoning:

1. **Function Logic Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to create a list `nums` of length `n` such that the sum of its elements equals `k` and the bitwise OR of the elements is maximized.
   - The function initializes all elements of `nums` to the highest power of 2 less than `k` (`(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`), which is the largest possible value that can be used without exceeding `k`.
   - After setting all elements to this value, it adjusts the last element to ensure the total sum equals `k`.

2. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The highest power of 2 less than `k` is chosen to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the OR of the numbers.
   - This approach ensures that the OR operation will include as many 1s as possible because the highest power of 2 will contribute to the highest bit positions.
   - The adjustment of the last element to make the total sum equal to `k` ensures that the sum constraint is met.

3. **Output Validation**:
   - The function returns a list `nums` where the first `n-1` elements are set to the highest power of 2 less than `k`, and the last element is adjusted to ensure the sum is `k`.
   - This output satisfies both the sum constraint and the requirement to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the OR of the numbers.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - Given the constraints and the logic of the function, the solution appears to be correct. The function correctly sets the elements to maximize the number of 1s in the OR operation while ensuring the sum constraint is met.

Correctness: **True**
