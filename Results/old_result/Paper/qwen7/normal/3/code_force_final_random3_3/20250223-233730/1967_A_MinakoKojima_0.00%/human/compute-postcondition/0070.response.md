Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` is set to `n` at the start of the loop.
   - The variable `n` is the next positive integer input split from the input string.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `i` is initialized to `n` at the start, the loop will not execute if `i` is already equal to `n`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` should be adjusted to be less than `n` for the loop to execute.
   - `n` remains as the next positive integer input split from the input string.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is the next positive integer input split from the input string**
