Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is the final value obtained by successively dividing it by elements in `arr` based on the direction indicated by characters in `s`, and `res` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `ans` after each iteration, modulo `m` and `MOD`, and `k` is the number of iterations left to process.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `arr`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `c`, `ans`, `res`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
