Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is `while power < log2(n)`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `power` and `n`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `power` is 3.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n_cases` is the input integer.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `power < log2(n)` must be true.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `power` is currently 3, for the loop to execute again, `log2(n)` must be greater than 3. This means \(n\) must be greater than \(2^3 = 8\).
   - The values of `t` and `n_cases` do not affect the loop condition directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.
   - The value of `i` is 1 and does not affect the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure that `log2(n)` is greater than 3.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`power` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 8**
