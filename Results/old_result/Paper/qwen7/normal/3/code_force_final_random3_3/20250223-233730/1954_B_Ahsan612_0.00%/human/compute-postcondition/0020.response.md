Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `i` is 3.
- `same` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `ar[3]` equals `num` or not.
- `num` is either the first element of the list `ar` or the third element of the list `ar`.
- `minn` is either infinity or 1.
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `while i < len(ar)`.

### Analysis:
For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < len(ar)` must be true. Given that `i` is currently 3, the loop will execute one more time if `len(ar) > 3`.

### Adjusting States:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
- Since `i` is currently 3, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` should be incremented to 4.
- The length of the list `ar` (`len(ar)`) must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
- `i` must be 4.
- `len(ar)` must be greater than 3.

### State:
State: **`i` is 4, `len(ar)` must be greater than 3**
