Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces. The first clue is not equal to 1, the third clue is greater than the fifth clue, and either both the third and fifth clues are even numbers or both are odd numbers. Additionally, the third clue is not equal to the fifth clue, and `clues[1] - clues[3] ≤ abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` and `clues[3] - clues[5] ≤ abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`.
