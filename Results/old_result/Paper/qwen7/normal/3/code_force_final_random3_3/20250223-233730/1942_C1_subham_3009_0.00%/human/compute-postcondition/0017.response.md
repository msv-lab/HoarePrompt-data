Output State: **`t` is now greater than 0 - 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the input split, `x` is the integer value of the second element of the input split, `y` is the integer value of the third element of the input split, `arr` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `[n, x, y]` is a list containing the string values of the first, second, and third elements of the input split respectively.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input().split()` takes the user's input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states. The list `arr` now contains the split elements as strings, and the list `[n, x, y]` contains the first three elements of the input as strings.
