Output State: **`not_mid` must be greater than 0; `i` is 3; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`; `arr[left + mid + 4]` is `big_element - 4`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + mid + i]`. Given that `i` is initially 4, after executing `i -= 1` (implied by `cliquess[left + mid + i]`), `i` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `not_mid` remains greater than 0, `i` is now 3, and `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is set to `clique`. The value of `arr[left + mid + 4]` remains `big_element - 4`.
