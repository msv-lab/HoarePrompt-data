Output State: **`i` is 2, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 33, `x` is an input integer, `s` is either `['1', '1', '0']` if `x & pow(2, i)` is greater than 0, or `['0', '0', '0']` otherwise.**

Explanation: The code `s.append('0')` adds the string `'0'` to the list `s`. Initially, `s` is either `['1', '1']` if `x & pow(2, i)` is greater than 0, or `['0', '0']` otherwise. After appending `'0'`, `s` becomes either `['1', '1', '0']` or `['0', '0', '0']` depending on the condition. The values of `i`, `length`, `nalla`, and `x` remain unchanged.
