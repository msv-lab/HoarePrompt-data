Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally.
2. The provided code uses dynamic programming to solve this problem. It initializes a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum points you can get if you have `i` cards left and `j` points.
3. The code iterates backward through the cards and updates the DP table based on whether the current card has been seen before or not.
4. The transitions in the DP table are correctly handled:
   - If the current card has not been seen (`cards.count(j + 1) == 0`), the state remains the same.
   - If the current card has been seen once (`cards.count(j + 1) == 1`), the player can either skip the card or use it to gain a point.
   - If the current card has been seen twice (`cards.count(j + 1) == 2`), the player can choose to use the card to gain a point or skip it.
5. The final answer is stored in `dp[0][0]`, which represents the maximum points you can get with no cards left and no points initially.

Given the logic and the transitions in the DP table, the code correctly implements the strategy to maximize your points while minimizing Nene's points.

Correctness: **True**
