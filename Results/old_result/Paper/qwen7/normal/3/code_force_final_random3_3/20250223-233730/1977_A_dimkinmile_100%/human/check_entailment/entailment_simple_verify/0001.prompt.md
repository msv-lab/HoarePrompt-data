You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if ((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: 'No'
    #State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n is an input integer, m is an input integer. If (n - m) is even and non-negative, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, (n - m) is odd or negative.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `input()` and converts it to an integer.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - A function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is unnecessary and should be removed or properly utilized.

3. **Test Case Processing**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program reads two integers `n` and `m` for each test case.
   - It checks if `(n - m)` is even and non-negative. If this condition is met, it prints 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative.
   - This condition is correct because:
     - Each move either adds 1 cube (increasing the count by 1) or removes 1 cube (decreasing the count by 1).
     - To end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, the net change in the number of cubes must be `m - initial_count`.
     - Since the initial count is 0, the net change must be `m`.
     - The net change `m` must be achievable by an even number of moves (since adding and removing cubes alternately results in an even net change).

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program outputs 'Yes' or 'No' correctly based on the condition.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves. The function `func_1()` is correctly defined and used within the loop to process each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
