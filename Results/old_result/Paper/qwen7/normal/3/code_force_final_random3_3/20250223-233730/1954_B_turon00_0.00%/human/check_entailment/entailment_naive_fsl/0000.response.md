Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from the array to make it non-beautiful. Specifically, the program does not handle cases where removing elements is necessary but does not account for the correct logic to minimize the number of removals.

For instance, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The program outputs `1`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1` because removing the element at index `2` (value `1`) would make the array `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful anymore. However, the program does not correctly identify this scenario.

Additionally, the program does not handle cases where the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements. For example, the input:
```
3
2 2 2
```
The program outputs `-1`, which is correct because the array is already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements. However, the program's logic for determining the minimum number of removals is flawed and does not generalize correctly for all cases.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, leading to a correctness of **False**.
