Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the length of the input string, `max_power` is the maximum power of the input string, `operational_list` is a list created from the split input.
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `rev_val` is either an empty list or a list containing the reversed string of `x` ('x_reversed'), `rev_res` is either the original string `x` or an empty string, `list_len` is the length of the input string, `max_power` is the maximum power of the input string, `operational_list` is a list created from the split input and must not be empty, and `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the original string `x`, `rev_val` remains empty and `rev_res` is set to `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` contains `'x_reversed'` and `rev_res` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `rev_val` is either an empty list or a list containing the reversed string of `x` (`'x_reversed'`), `rev_res` is either the original string `x` or the original string `x` plus the string `x`, `list_len` is the length of the input string, `max_power` is the maximum power of the input string, `operational_list` is a list created from the split input and now has one less element, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`, `x_rev` is calculated as `int(x[::-1])`, and `rev_val` now contains the reversed string of `x` if `len(str(x_rev))` equals the length of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `rev_val` is either an empty list or a list containing the reversed string of `x` (`'x_reversed'`), `rev_res` is either the original string `x` or the original string `x` plus the string `x`, `list_len` is the length of the input string, `max_power` is the maximum power of the input string, `operational_list` is a list created from the split input and now has two less elements, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`, calculated as `int(x[::-1])`. If `len(str(x_rev))` equals the length of `x`, `rev_val` contains the reversed string of `x`; otherwise, `rev_val` is updated by appending the reversed string of `x` to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
