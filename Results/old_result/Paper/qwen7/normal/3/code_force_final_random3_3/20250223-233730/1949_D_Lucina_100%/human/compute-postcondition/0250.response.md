Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `j` is 2
   - `nx` is either 'F' or 'S' followed by the character at index `xx[2][1]`
   - `n` is a positive integer

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `j` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer and does not change within the loop.

5. **Update the state of `nx`**: The value of `nx` is dependent on `xx[2][1]`. Since `j` is incremented to 3, `xx[2][1]` remains the same, so `nx` will still be either 'F' or 'S' followed by the character at index `xx[2][1]`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 3, `nx` is either 'F' or 'S' followed by the character at index `xx[2][1]`, and `n` is a positive integer**.
