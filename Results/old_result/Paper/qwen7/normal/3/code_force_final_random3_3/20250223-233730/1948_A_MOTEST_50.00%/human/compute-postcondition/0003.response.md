State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 1, `i` must be 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(t):` will start executing if `t` is at least 1 because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`.
2. The variable `i` will start at 0 during the first iteration of the loop.
3. The variable `n` is not directly involved in the loop condition but could be used within the loop body. However, since the problem asks to adjust the states for the loop to execute, we focus on the loop head, which involves `t` and `i`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be at least 1 (since `t` is the parameter for `range()`), and `i` must be initialized to 0, as it is the starting point of the loop.
