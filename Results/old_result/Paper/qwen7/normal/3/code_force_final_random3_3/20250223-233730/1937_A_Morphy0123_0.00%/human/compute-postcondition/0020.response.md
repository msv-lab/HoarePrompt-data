Output: **2 ** 14**

Explanation: According to the initial state, `power` is explicitly given as 14. The expression `2 ** power` calculates 2 raised to the power of 14. Since no other values are provided for `t`, `n_cases`, `i`, or `n`, these variables do not affect the calculation of the print statement. Therefore, the print statement will output \(2^{14}\).
