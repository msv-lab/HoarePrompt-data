Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^6; the list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(int(input())):
    rev_val = []
    rev_res = ''
    list_len, max_power = input().split()
    operational_list = input().split()
    for x in operational_list:
        x_rev = int(x[::-1])
        if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
            rev_res = rev_res + x
        else:
            rev_val.append(x[::-1])
    rev_val.sort()
    for x in range(len(rev_val)):
        if x % 2 == 0:
            val_in = int(rev_val[x])
            rev_res += str(val_in)
        else:
            val_in = rev_val[x]
            rev_res += val_in[::-1]
    if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Anna')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `rev_res` is a string that concatenates the integer representations of even-indexed elements from `rev_val` and the reversed versions of odd-indexed elements from `rev_val`, in the order they appear in `rev_val`. This holds true whether or not \(10^{int(max_power)}\) is less than `rev_res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `x` is an integer equal to `len(rev_val)`, `rev_val` remains unchanged as a list, and `rev_res` is a string. For each index `i` in `rev_val`:
- If `i` is even, the string representation of `rev_val[i]` is appended to `rev_res`.
- If `i` is odd, the reverse of `rev_val[i]` is concatenated to `rev_res`. The maximum power represented by `max_power` is less than or equal to the length of `rev_res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The final value of `rev_res` is constructed by iterating through `rev_val`. For each index `x` in `rev_val`:
- If `x` is even, `rev_res` is updated by appending the string representation of the integer value of `rev_val[x]`.
- If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is updated by appending the reverse of the string value of `rev_val[x]`.
After all iterations, regardless of whether \(10^{int(max_power)}\) is less than the integer value represented by `rev_res` or not, `rev_res` contains a concatenated string formed according to these rules.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
