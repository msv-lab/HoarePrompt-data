Postcondition: `cur`, `cnt`, `adv`, `j`, and `ans` are adjusted according to the following rules:
- If `i > 0`, then `j` is updated to `adv - 1 - (a[i - 1] - (j + 2) - 1)`, `adv` is updated to `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur) - adv`, `ans` contains `n - 1` elements each calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1 - j)`, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, and `cur` is decreased by `adv`.
- Since there is no else part, no additional changes occur if `i <= 0`.
