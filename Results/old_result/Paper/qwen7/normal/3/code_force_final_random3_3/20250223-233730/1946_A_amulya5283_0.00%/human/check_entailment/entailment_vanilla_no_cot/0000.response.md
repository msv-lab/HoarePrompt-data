Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Here's why:

1. **Heap Usage**: The code uses a min-heap to keep track of elements from the median position onwards after sorting the array. However, this approach doesn't correctly simulate the process of incrementing elements to increase the median.

2. **Incorrect Median Calculation**: The code calculates the median index using `n // 2`, which is correct for even-sized arrays but incorrect for odd-sized arrays. For odd-sized arrays, the median index should be `n // 2` when zero-indexed.

3. **Heap Operations**: The code increments the smallest element in the heap until it exceeds the current median. This approach doesn't guarantee the minimum number of operations needed because it doesn't consider the possibility of incrementing other elements to achieve the same result with fewer operations.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Sort the array.
2. Identify the median.
3. Calculate the difference between the median and the next greater element(s) to determine the minimum number of operations needed.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, arr in test_cases:
        arr.sort()
        median_index = n // 2
        current_median = arr[median_index]
        
        # Calculate the number of operations needed
        operations = 0
        for i in range(median_index):
            if arr[i] < current_median:
                operations += current_median - arr[i]
        
        results.append(operations)
    return results

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        arr = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + n]))
        test_cases.append((n, arr))
        index += 1 + n
    results = func_1(t, test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This version correctly calculates the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median by iterating through the array and counting the differences between the current elements and the median.
