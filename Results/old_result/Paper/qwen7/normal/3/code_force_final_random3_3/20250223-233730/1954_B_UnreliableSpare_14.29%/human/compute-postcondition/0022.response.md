Output State: **`ans` is set to Decimal('Infinity'), `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains as the original input integer, `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, and `flag` remains False; `val` is equal to `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `val` and `cnt`. `val` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, and `cnt` is initialized to 0. The values of `ans`, `i`, `n`, `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]`, and `flag` remain unchanged from their initial states.
