Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `arr`. The condition for the loop to continue is that `arr` must contain at least one element.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `arr` must contain at least one element.
   - `i` is no longer the first element of `arr`.
   - `ans` is the product of the original first element of `arr` and the previous value of `ans`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is no longer the first element of `arr`, it means that the first element of `arr` has already been processed.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must still contain at least one element (since the loop continues as long as `arr` has elements).
   - `i` will now be the next element in `arr`.
   - `ans` will be updated to the product of the current `i` and the previous value of `ans`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `arr` must still contain at least one element.
   - `i` will be the next element in `arr`.
   - `ans` will be the product of the current `i` and the previous value of `ans`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `ans` is the product of the current `i` and the previous value of `ans`**.
