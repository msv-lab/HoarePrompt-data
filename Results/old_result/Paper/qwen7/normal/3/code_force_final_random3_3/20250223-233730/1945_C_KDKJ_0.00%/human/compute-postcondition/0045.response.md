Output State: **`i` is 1, `left` is `S[0][0]`, `lsum` is `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`, `left` is `S[1][0]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `left` to `S[i][0]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `left` is now set to `S[1][0]`. The other variables (`i`, `lsum`, `rsum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
