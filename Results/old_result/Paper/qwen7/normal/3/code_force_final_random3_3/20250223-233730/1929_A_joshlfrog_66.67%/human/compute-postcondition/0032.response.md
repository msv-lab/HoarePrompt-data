Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `e` is 0, `l` is the length of the list `nums`, `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.

Explanation: 
- The variable `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) as it was initially set.
- The variable `e` remains 0 as there is no operation that changes it.
- The variable `l` is set to the length of the list `nums` when the loop starts.
- The variable `x` is updated during each iteration to hold the maximum value encountered in the list `nums`.
- The variable `y` is updated during each iteration to hold the minimum value encountered in the list `nums`.

After all iterations of the loop, `x` will contain the highest value in the list `nums`, and `y` will contain the lowest value in the list `nums`.
