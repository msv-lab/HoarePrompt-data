Output State: **`x` is 0, `x_rev` is 0, and `rev_val` contains the reversed string of `x`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_val.append(x[::-1])` appends the reversed string of `x` to the list `rev_val`. Since `x` is 0, its string representation is "0". Reversing "0" still results in "0". Therefore, `rev_val` now contains the string "0". The values of `x` and `x_rev` remain unchanged.
