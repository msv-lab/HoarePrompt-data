Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `left` is `S[0][0]`
   - `lsum` is `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`
   - `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that if the condition `(left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum)` is true, the function does nothing. Otherwise, `i` is assigned to `ans`.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 1 for the next iteration.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `left`, `lsum`, and `rsum` are not modified within the loop body based on the given information. Therefore, their values remain the same for the next iteration.

6. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `(left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum)` is checked at the beginning of each iteration.
   - If this condition is true, the function does nothing, and `i` remains unchanged.
   - If the condition is false, `i` is assigned to `ans`.

Given that `i` will be incremented to 1 for the next iteration, and no other changes are made to `left`, `lsum`, and `rsum`, the states for the next iteration are as follows:

**State: **`i` is 1, `left` is `S[0][0]`, `lsum` is `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`**
