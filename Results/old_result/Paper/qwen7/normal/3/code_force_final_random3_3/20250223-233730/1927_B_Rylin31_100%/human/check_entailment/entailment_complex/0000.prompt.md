Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the second line contains n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i < n.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        l = int(input())
        
        s = [(0) for i in range(l)]
        
        array = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        ans = ''
        
        for j in array:
            ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
            s[j] += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `ans` is a string consisting of characters derived from the values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`, where `s[j]` has been incremented by the number of times its index was encountered in `array`. The variable `i` will be equal to the total number of test cases, `s` will be a list of integers where each element `s[j]` is incremented by the count of how many times `j` appears in `array`, and `array` will be a list of integers as provided by the input. The final `ans` will be constructed by concatenating characters based on the updated values in `s`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `ans` will be a string made up of characters from the alphabet (starting from 'a' to 'z') based on how many times each index in `array` appears, and `s` will reflect the cumulative count of these appearances for each index.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) indicating the number of subsequent test cases, then reads another integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) non-negative integers. It constructs a string `ans` by converting the values of `s[j] + 97` to characters from the alphabet ('a' to 'z'), where `s[j]` is incremented by the count of how many times `j` appears in the list. After processing all test cases, it prints the constructed strings `ans` for each case.
