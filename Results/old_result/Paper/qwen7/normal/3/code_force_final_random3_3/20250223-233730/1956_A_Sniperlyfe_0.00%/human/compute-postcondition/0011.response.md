Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers (with the first element removed), `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended with the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `n` is the second element in `qs`**.

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Here, `n` is the second element in the list `qs`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `res` now contains its previous elements plus the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
