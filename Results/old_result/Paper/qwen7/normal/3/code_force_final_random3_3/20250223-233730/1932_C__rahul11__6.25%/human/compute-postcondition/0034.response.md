Output State: **`k` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is the same as before, `r` is decreased by 1 if `s[k]` is not 'L', `c` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`. This means that `ans` is divided by `arr[r]` and then taken modulo `MOD`. The other variables (`k`, `n`, `res[c]`, `l`, and `c`) are not directly affected by this line of code. The value of `c` is increased by 1, and if `s[k]` is not 'L', then `r` is decreased by 1. The value of `l` remains unchanged.
