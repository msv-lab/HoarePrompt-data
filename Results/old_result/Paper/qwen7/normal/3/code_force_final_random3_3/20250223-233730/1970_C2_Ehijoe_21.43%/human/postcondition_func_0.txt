The function accepts a dictionary `nodes` where each key is a node (an integer) and its value is a list of integers representing its neighbors, excluding the parent node if provided. It also accepts an integer `start` representing the starting node and an optional integer `parent` representing the parent node of the current node being processed (default is None). The function returns a list containing the path lengths from the start node to all other nodes in the graph, calculated by adding 1 to the distances returned by recursive calls to `func_1(nodes, node, start)` for every node in `nodes[start]` that is not equal to the parent. If no valid path is found, it returns a list containing the single element 0.
