Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_diff` is `-inf`, `next_max_diff` is `-inf`, `index` is `None`, `A` is assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values from `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique elements returned by `func_4()`, `F` is assigned the values returned by `func_4()`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    diff = A[i] - A[i - 1]
    if diff > max_diff:
        max_diff = diff
        index = i
    elif diff > next_max_diff:
        next_max_diff = diff


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `max_diff` is equal to `diff` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise `max_diff` remains `-inf`. `next_max_diff` is `-inf` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise it is updated to `diff` if `diff > next_max_diff`. `index` is `i` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise it remains `None`. `A`, `diff`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` retain their original values from `func_4()`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `max_diff` is equal to `diff` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise `max_diff` remains `-inf`. `next_max_diff` is equal to `diff` if `diff > next_max_diff`, otherwise it remains unchanged. `index` is `i` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise it remains `None`. `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` retain their original values from `func_4()`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `max_diff` is equal to the maximum difference encountered so far, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference encountered so far (or remains unchanged if no new second maximum was found), `index` is the index where `max_diff` was found (or remains `None` if `max_diff` did not change), `diff` is updated to `A[i] - A[i - 1]`, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, and `A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` retain their original values from `func_4()`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
