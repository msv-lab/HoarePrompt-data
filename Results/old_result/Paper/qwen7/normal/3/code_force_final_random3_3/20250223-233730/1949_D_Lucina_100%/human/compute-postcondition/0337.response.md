Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `nx` is either 'SS' or 'SF'
   - `xx[1][1]` remains unchanged and stays as '?'

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - Since `n` must be at least 2, it remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` remains unchanged as 1.
   - `j` is incremented to 3.
   - `n` remains at least 2.
   - `nx` remains either 'SS' or 'SF'.
   - `xx[1][1]` remains unchanged and stays as '?'.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, `nx` is either 'SS' or 'SF', and `xx[1][1]` remains unchanged and stays as '?'**.
