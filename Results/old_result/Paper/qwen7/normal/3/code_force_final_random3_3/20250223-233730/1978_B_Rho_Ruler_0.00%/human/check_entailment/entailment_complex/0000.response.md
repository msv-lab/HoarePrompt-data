Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem using binary search to find the optimal value of \( k \).
2. The binary search is aimed at maximizing the profit, which is calculated as \( k \times b + (n - k) \times a \).
3. The function `func_1` checks if the current value of \( k \) results in a profit that is within the allowed limit, i.e., \( k \times b + (n - k) \times a \leq n \times \max(a, b) \).
4. If the condition in `func_1` is met, it suggests that the current \( k \) is potentially a good candidate, and the search continues to the right half by setting `low = mid + 1`. Otherwise, it searches the left half by setting `high = mid - 1`.
5. The loop terminates when `low > high`, and the optimal \( k \) is stored in `ans`.

However, there is an issue with the logic in the function `func_1`. The function should directly calculate the profit and compare it with the maximum possible profit, which is \( n \times \max(a, b) \). Instead, it incorrectly compares the sum \( k \times b + (n - k) \times a \) with \( n \times \max(a, b) \).

To fix this, the function should be corrected to:

```python
def func_1(k, a, b, n):
    profit = k * b + (n - k) * a
    return profit <= n * max(a, b)
```

Given the provided code and the explanation, the current implementation is incorrect because it uses an unnecessary comparison that does not correctly determine the maximum profit.

Correctness: **False**
