### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Initialization**: 
  - `cliques = ceil(n / k)` calculates the minimum number of cliques needed.
  - `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized as arrays of size `n` with default values `0`.

- **Loop through Cliques**:
  - The loop runs from `0` to `cliques - 1`.
  - For each iteration `i`, `make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)` is called to fill `arr` and `cliquess` for the current clique.

#### Function `make_array`:
- **Initialization**:
  - `small_element` and `big_element` are calculated based on the range `[left, right]`.
  - `mid` is the midpoint of the range, and `not_mid` is the remaining part of the range.

- **Filling `arr` and `cliquess`**:
  - The first half of the range `[left, left + mid - 1]` is filled with consecutive integers starting from `small_element`.
  - The second half of the range `[left + mid, left + mid + not_mid - 1]` is filled with consecutive integers starting from `big_element - 1` and decrementing.

#### Verification of Correctness:

1. **Distinct Values in `arr`**:
   - The `make_array` function ensures that the elements in the range `[left, right]` are filled with consecutive integers.
   - Since `small_element` and `big_element` are calculated correctly, and the ranges are properly divided, `arr` will contain distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Clique Assignment**:
   - The `cliquess` array assigns the same clique number to all elements within the range `[left, right]`.
   - This ensures that all elements in the same range belong to the same clique, and different ranges belong to different cliques.

3. **Graph Construction**:
   - The condition for adding an edge between vertices `(i, j)` is `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.
   - Given the way `arr` is constructed, for any two elements in the same clique, the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` will hold true because they are consecutive or near-consecutive integers.

4. **Partition into Minimum Clique Number**:
   - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`, which is the minimum possible number of cliques required to satisfy the condition for the given `n` and `k`.

#### Conclusion:
- The program correctly implements the logic to generate a valid assignment of integers to vertices and partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
