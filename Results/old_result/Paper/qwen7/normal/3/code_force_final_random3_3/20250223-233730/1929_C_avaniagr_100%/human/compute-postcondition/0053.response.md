Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x - k + 3`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `k` is the result of splitting `s` and converting it to an integer, then decreasing by 2.
   - `x` is the second value of `s` split and converted to an integer.
   - `a` is the third value of `s` split and converted to an integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `x - k + 3`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - For the loop to start, `x - k + 3` must be a positive number (greater than or equal to 1) because the loop will not run if this value is zero or negative.
   - `i` starts from 0, so the loop will run at least once if `x - k + 3` is greater than 0.

Given the above points, we need to ensure that `x - k + 3` is greater than 0. This means that `x` should be greater than `k - 3`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should include:
- `k` being the result of splitting `s` and converting it to an integer, then decreasing by 2.
- `x` being the second value of `s` split and converted to an integer, such that `x > k - 3`.
- `a` being the third value of `s` split and converted to an integer (though it does not affect the loop execution).

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`k` is `s` split and converted to int and decreased by 2, `x` is the second value of `s` split and converted to int and must be greater than `k - 3`, `a` is the third value of `s` split and converted to int**.
