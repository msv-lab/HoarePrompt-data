Output State: **`Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `min(n // k, k)`, `k` is `k - max(int(n / k), k)`**

Explanation: The code `k = k - Max` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `Max` from it. Here, `Max` is defined as `max(int(n / k), k)`. Therefore, `k` is updated to `k - max(int(n / k), k)`. The values of `Min` and `number` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
