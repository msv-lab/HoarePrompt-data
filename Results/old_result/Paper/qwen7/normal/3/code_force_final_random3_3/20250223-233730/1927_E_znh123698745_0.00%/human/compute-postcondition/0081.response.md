Output State: **`k` is the input value of `k` decremented by 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `array` is a list containing numbers from 1 to `n`, `answer` is a list containing the numbers 1 and 2, `a` is a list containing [3, -1]**.

Explanation: The code `a[0] += 1` increments the first element of the list `a` by 1. Initially, `a` was `[2, -1]`. After executing the code, the first element `a[0]` becomes `2 + 1`, which is `3`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
