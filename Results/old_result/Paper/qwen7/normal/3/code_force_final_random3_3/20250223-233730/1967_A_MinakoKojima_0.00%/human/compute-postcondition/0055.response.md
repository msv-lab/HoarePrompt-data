Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is equal to `ans * (a[3] - a[2])`
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - The value of `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop condition depends on `i < n`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - The variable `ans` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the loop head.
   - `i` changes from 3 to 4.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `ans` is equal to `ans * (a[3] - a[2])`, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 0**
