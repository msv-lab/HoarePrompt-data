Output State: **`prime_to_i` is now multiplied by `prime`, `factors[prime]` is decreased by 1, and `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded**

Explanation: The code snippet `yield factor * prime_to_i` yields the value of `factor * prime_to_i`. This does not assign a new value to any variable but rather produces a value that can be used outside the current scope. The values of `prime_to_i`, `factors[prime]`, and `factor` are updated according to the initial state provided. Therefore, the output state retains the information about these variables as described in the initial state.
