Output State: **`rev_val` is either an empty list or a list containing the reversed string of `x` (`'x_reversed'`), `rev_res` is the original string `x` plus the string `x`, `list_len` is the length of the input string, `max_power` is the maximum power of the input string, `operational_list` is a list created from the split input and now has one less element, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`**

Explanation: The code `rev_res = rev_res + x` concatenates the string `x` to `rev_res`. Since `rev_res` was either the original string `x` or an empty string, after this operation, `rev_res` will be the original string `x` concatenated with itself. All other variables remain unchanged.
