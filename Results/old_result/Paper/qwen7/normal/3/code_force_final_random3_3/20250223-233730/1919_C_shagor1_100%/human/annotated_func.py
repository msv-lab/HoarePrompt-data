#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1():
    pass
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a set of test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. For each test case, it determines and returns a specific value or result based on the given conditions. The function ensures that the input constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) are met and that the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
