You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        A = int(m / a) + 1
        B = int(m / b) + 1
        print(A + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a, b, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        A = int(m / a) + 1
        
        B = int(m / b) + 1
        
        print(A + B)
        
    #State: t is an input integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 3\), `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `A` is `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`, `A` is recalculated as `int(m / a) + 1` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases (up to 10,000). For each test case, it reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) and calculates two values \(A\) and \(B\) based on these inputs. Specifically, \(A\) is set to \(\text{int}(m / a) + 1\) and \(B\) is set to \(\text{int}(m / b) + 1\). The function then prints the sum \(A + B\) for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. Specifically, the logic for calculating `A` and `B` assumes that the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is simply the sum of the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period. However, this approach does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations.

For example, consider the input `(a=6, b=7, m=4)`. According to the problem description, the first installation launches fireworks at times `[6, 12, 18, 24, ...]` and the second installation at times `[7, 14, 21, 28, ...]`. Within the first 4 minutes, the only time a firework is launched by either installation is at `t=6` (from the first installation) and `t=7` (from the second installation). Therefore, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2, which matches the expected output.

However, the program incorrectly calculates `A` and `B` as follows:
- `A = int(m / a) + 1 = int(4 / 6) + 1 = 1`
- `B = int(m / b) + 1 = int(4 / 7) + 1 = 1`

This results in `A + B = 2`, which is correct for this specific example, but the program does not handle the general case correctly. For instance, if `m` is larger, such as `m=10`, the correct answer would be 2, but the program would still output 2, which is incorrect because the first installation could launch fireworks at `t=6` and `t=12`, and the second installation at `t=7` and `t=14`, resulting in a maximum of 2 fireworks visible at `t=7`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
