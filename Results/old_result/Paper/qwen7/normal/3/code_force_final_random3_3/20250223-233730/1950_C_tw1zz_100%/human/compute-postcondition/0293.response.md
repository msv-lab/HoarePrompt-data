Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is controlled by the input value. The loop runs for a number of iterations equal to the integer input provided by the user.

2. **Understand the Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as the input integer is positive.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - The only variable directly controlled by the loop head is the input integer itself. This integer determines how many times the loop will run.
   - At the end of each iteration, the input integer decreases by 1 (since it is used in the range function).

4. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440.
   - `h` is the hour part of the input split by ':'.
   - `m` is the minute part of the input split by ':'.
   - `h1` is either '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', or '15'.
   - `m1` is equal to `m`.
   - `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.

5. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by the input integer, we need to decrement the input integer by 1 for the next iteration.
   - All other variables (`s`, `t`, `h`, `m`, `h1`, `m1`, `time`) remain unchanged because they are not directly controlled by the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- The input integer is decremented by 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of the input split by ':', `m` is the minute part of the input split by ':', `h1` is either '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', or '15', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM', and the input integer is decremented by 1**.
