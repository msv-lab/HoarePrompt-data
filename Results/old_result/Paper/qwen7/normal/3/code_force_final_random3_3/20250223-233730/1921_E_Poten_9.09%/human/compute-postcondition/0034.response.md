Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Bob', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces. The first clue is not equal to 1, the third clue is less than or equal to the fifth clue, and either both the third and fifth clues are even numbers or both are odd numbers. Additionally, the third clue is not equal to the fifth clue.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, ensuring that the conditions specified in the precondition are maintained and that the appropriate value ('Draw' or 'Bob') is added to the `answers` list based on the condition evaluated in the if statement.
