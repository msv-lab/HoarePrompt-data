Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is `t-1`, which means `t` is one less than its original value.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.

The expression to be evaluated and printed is:

\[ \text{int}((b - a) \times (b - a + 1) // 2 + a \times n) \]

Let's break it down:

1. **Calculate \( b - a \):**
   This is simply the difference between the input integers `b` and `a`.

2. **Calculate \( (b - a) \times (b - a + 1) // 2 \):**
   This is the sum of the first \( b - a \) integers. The formula for the sum of the first \( k \) integers is \( \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \). Here, \( k = b - a \).

3. **Add \( a \times n \):**
   This term adds the product of `a` and `n` to the result from the previous step.

4. **Convert to integer:**
   The entire expression is cast to an integer, but since the division by 2 is integer division (`//`), the result will already be an integer.

Putting it all together, the expression calculates the sum of the first \( b - a \) integers plus the product of `a` and `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)**
