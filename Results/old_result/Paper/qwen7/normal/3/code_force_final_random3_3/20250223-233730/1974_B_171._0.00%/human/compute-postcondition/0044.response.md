Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `char`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more characters in `encoded` to process.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `char` is the next character in `encoded`.
   - `decoded` either has one more element than before with the last element being the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`, or `decoded` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' and the additional character 'z'.
   - `c` is 122 (the ASCII value for 'z').
   - `char` remains unchanged from its initial value.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each character in `encoded`, `char` will be the next character in `encoded` for the next iteration.
   - `decoded` will either have one more element than before with the last element being the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`, or it will contain all characters from 'a' to 'z' and the additional character 'z'.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `char` will be the next character in `encoded`.
   - `decoded` will either have one more element than before with the last element being the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`, or it will contain all characters from 'a' to 'z' and the additional character 'z'.
   - `c` will remain 122 since it is not updated within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`char` is the next character in `encoded`, `decoded` either has one more element than before with the last element being the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`, or `decoded` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' and the additional character 'z', `c` is 122**
