Output State: **`Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**

Explanation: The code calculates the values of `Min` and `Max`. Specifically, `Min` is set to the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, while `Max` is set to the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. The conditions that `n` must be greater than 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` must be less than 60, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k` remain unchanged.
