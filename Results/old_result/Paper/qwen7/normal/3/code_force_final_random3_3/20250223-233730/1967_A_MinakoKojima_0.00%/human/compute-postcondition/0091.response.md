Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` is the next positive integer input split from the input string.
- `k` is the second integer input split from the input string.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `m` is the minimum value in list `a`.
- `ans` is either `math.factorial(n)` if `k >= n * m`, or the product of the differences between consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`.
- `i` is equal to `n`.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`. To determine the exact value of `ans`, we need to consider the conditions under which it is computed.

Let's break down the conditions:

1. If `k >= n * m`, then `ans = math.factorial(n)`.
2. Otherwise, `ans` is the product of the differences between consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, and `a` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output one of these two forms.

Output: **math.factorial(n) if k >= n * m, otherwise the product of the differences between consecutive elements in the list a from index 1 to n-1**
