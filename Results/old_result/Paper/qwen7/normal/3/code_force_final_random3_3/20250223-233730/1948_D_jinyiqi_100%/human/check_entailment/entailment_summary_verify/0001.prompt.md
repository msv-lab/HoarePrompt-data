You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s , consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or
question marks.

A tandem repeat is a string of an even length such that its first half is
equal to its second half.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the
deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and
several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Your goal is to replace each question mark with some lowercase Latin letter in
such a way that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is
maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains a string s (1 \le |s| \le 5000 ),
consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.

The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000 .

Output

For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum length of the longest
substring that is a tandem repeat after you replace each question mark in the
string with some lowercase Latin letter.

If it's impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in the string, print 0
.

Example

Input

    4
    
    zaabaabz
    
    ?????
    
    code?????s
    
    codeforces

Output

    6
    4
    10
    0

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
    print(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes no parameters and does not return any value. It processes a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The function checks for pairs of characters in the string that are either equal or both question marks, starting from the middle of the string and moving towards the beginning. For each possible pair distance (from half the string length down to 1), it counts how many such valid pairs exist. If it finds a valid pair distance where the count equals the distance, it prints the count doubled and exits. If no such distance is found, it prints 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not implemented in the provided code.
   - This suggests that the implementation of `func_1()` might be incomplete or incorrect.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - Inside this loop, it calls `func_1()`, which should process the string `s`.

4. **Function `func_1()` Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1()` converts the string `s` into a list of characters.
   - It calculates the length of the string `n`.
   - It iterates over possible lengths of tandem repeats starting from the largest possible (half the length of the string) down to 1.
   - For each possible length `j`, it checks if the substring of length `j` at position `k` can form a tandem repeat.
   - If the characters at positions `k` and `k+j` are either both `?` or equal, it increments a counter `count`.
   - If the characters do not match, it resets the counter `count`.
   - If the counter `count` reaches `j`, it prints `2*j` and returns, indicating a tandem repeat of length `2*j` has been found.
   - If no tandem repeat is found, it prints `0`.

### Issues in the Provided Code

1. **Incomplete Function:**
   - The function `func_1()` is not fully implemented. It does not handle the replacement of `?` with lowercase Latin letters to maximize the tandem repeat length.

2. **Logic for Tandem Repeat Check:**
   - The logic for checking if a substring can form a tandem repeat is correct, but it does not account for replacing `?` with appropriate characters to maximize the tandem repeat length.

3. **Output:**
   - The output is based on the first valid tandem repeat found, but it does not ensure the maximum possible length of the tandem repeat.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It attempts to find a tandem repeat but does not consider the possibility of replacing `?` to maximize the tandem repeat length.
