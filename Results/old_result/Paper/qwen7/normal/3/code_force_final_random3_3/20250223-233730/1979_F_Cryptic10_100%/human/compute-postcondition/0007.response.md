Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n-2 except for `n-3`, `v1` is `n-3`, `v2` is `n-3`, `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(v1, v2)`**.

Explanation: The code `ops += [(v1, v2)]` appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. Given that `v1` is `n-3` and `v2` is `n-3`, the tuple added to `ops` is `(n-3, n-3)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
