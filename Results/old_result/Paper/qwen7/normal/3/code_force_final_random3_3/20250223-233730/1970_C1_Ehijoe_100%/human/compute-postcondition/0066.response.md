Output State: **`tree` list includes the node `e`; `prev` holds the last node that was visited before `e`; `curr` is equal to `e`; `start` is an input integer.**

The code `start = int(input())` assigns the integer value of the user's input to the variable `start`. The other variables (`tree`, `prev`, and `curr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
