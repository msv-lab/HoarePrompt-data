Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` must be equal to the initial value of `t`, `n` is an integer for each iteration, and if `n` is odd, it remains odd. If `n` is even, it remains even. Additionally, `s` is a string consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times for each even `n`, with the length of `s` being either less than 200 or 200 or more for each iteration.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` will still hold its initial value, as the loop only processes `t` iterations but does not modify `t` itself. For each iteration, `n` is read from user input and checked for parity. If `n` is even, `s` is constructed as described, and depending on its length, either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed. The state of `s` from previous iterations is not affected by new inputs, so the final state of `s` will reflect the last processed `n` value unless the loop was interrupted or the program terminated.
