Output State: **`ops` is unchanged except for the last tuple which now has its first element appended with `v1`; `v1` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops` before the operation; `v2` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops` before the operation.**

Explanation: The code modifies the last tuple in the `ops` list. It checks if the last element of the last tuple (`p1[-1]`) is equal to `v2`. If it is, it appends `v1` to `p2` (which is the same as `p1` in this case since `p2` is not defined elsewhere). If it is not, it appends `v1` to `p1`. In both cases, `v1` is appended to the last tuple in `ops`. The values of `v1` and `v2` remain the same as they were before the operation.
