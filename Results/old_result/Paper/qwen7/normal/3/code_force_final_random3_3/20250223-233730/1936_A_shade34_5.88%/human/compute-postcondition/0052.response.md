Output State: **`i` is 2, 3, or 4; `n` must be greater than 3; `s` is a string input by the user; if `s` is '<', `pans` contains `[i-1]` and `mak` is equal to `i-1`; otherwise, `pans` remains unchanged and `s` is the new input string from the user.**

In this output state, the variable `s` has been updated to the string input by the user. The values of `i`, `n`, `pans`, and `mak` remain as they were under the given conditions before the input was taken.
