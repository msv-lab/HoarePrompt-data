Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the range function which uses `2` as its argument.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `j`**: Since the loop starts with `j = 0` (as per the given initial state), and the range function goes from `0` to `1` (inclusive), the loop will execute twice with `j` taking values `0` and `1`.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `2`. Given the initial value of `j` is `0`, the loop will definitely execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the initial state of `j` is correctly set to start the loop. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `arr`, and `lex`) do not affect the loop's execution condition directly.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `j`.

**State:**
**`j` is 0**
