Output State: **`max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` must be greater than 1, `y` is `x-1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.**

The code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the `math.gcd` function. The values of `max_sum`, `best_y`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new variable `gcd_val` is assigned the GCD of `x` and `y`.
