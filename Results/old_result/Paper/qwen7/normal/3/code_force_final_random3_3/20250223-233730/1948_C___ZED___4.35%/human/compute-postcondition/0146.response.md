Output State: **`no_path` is False, `i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `k` is 3, `a` is a new string input by the user, `b` is the new input string.**

The code `no_path = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `no_path`. Since no other variables are affected, their previous values remain unchanged.
