Postcondition: `k` is an integer equal to the first number in the string `s`, `x` is an integer equal to the second number in the string `s`, `a` is an integer equal to the third number in the string `s`, `s` is the second line of the input (a string), and the current value of `x` is less than `k - 1`. Additionally, the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`.
