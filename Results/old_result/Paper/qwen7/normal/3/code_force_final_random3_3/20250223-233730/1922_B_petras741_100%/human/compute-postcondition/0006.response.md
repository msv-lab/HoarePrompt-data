Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `buffer` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `q` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
