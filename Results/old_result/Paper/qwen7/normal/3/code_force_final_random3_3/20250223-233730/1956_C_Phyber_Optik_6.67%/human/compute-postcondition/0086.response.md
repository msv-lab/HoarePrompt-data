Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and the range it iterates over, which is from 1 to `n + r + 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` is at least 1
   - `t` is some initial value (not involved in the loop)
   - `i` is some initial value (not involved in the loop)
   - `r` is some initial value (not involved in the loop)
   - Either `j` is less than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than `n`.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n + r + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts at 1, for the loop to continue, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will be 2 in the next iteration.
   - The values of `n`, `t`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `j` is now 2.
   - `n` remains at least 1.
   - `t` remains some initial value.
   - `i` remains some initial value.
   - `r` remains some initial value.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is still that `j` is less than or equal to `n + r + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `j` is 2, `n` is at least 1, `t` is some initial value, `i` is some initial value, `r` is some initial value, and either `j` is less than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than `n`.**
