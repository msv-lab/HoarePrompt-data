Output State: **The loop has executed all iterations. The value of `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains as the original input integer, `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, and `flag` remains False since no break occurs in the if condition throughout all iterations.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `n-1` (since the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`), the list `arr` and the integer `n` remain unchanged from their initial states, the condition `arr[i] != arr[i - 1]` holds true for at least one pair of consecutive elements in `arr`, and the boolean `flag` remains `False` because the loop did not encounter a situation where it needed to break.
