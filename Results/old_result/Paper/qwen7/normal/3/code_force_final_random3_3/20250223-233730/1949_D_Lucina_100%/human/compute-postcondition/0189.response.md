To determine what will be printed, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is set to `n + 1`.
   - `j` is also set to `n + 1` after the loop runs from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - `nx` is a string built up during the loop based on the values of `xx[i][j - 1]` under certain conditions.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n` inclusive.
   - For each iteration, the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is checked.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is a specific condition (let's assume it is a boolean condition), then either 'F' or 'S' is appended to `nx`.

Given this information, let's assume the specific condition for appending 'F' or 'S' is not explicitly stated. Without loss of generality, let's assume the condition is such that 'F' is appended if `xx[i][j - 1]` is True, and 'S' is appended if `xx[i][j - 1]` is False.

Since `i` is set to `n + 1` and the loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`, the loop will check `xx[n+1][0]` to `xx[n+1][n-1]` (assuming `xx` is a 2D list).

However, the exact content of `xx` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact characters that will be appended to `nx`. But based on the structure, `nx` will be a string composed of 'F' and 'S' based on the conditions of `xx[n+1][j-1]` for `j` from 1 to `n`.

Therefore, the output will be a string composed of 'F' and 'S' based on the conditions of `xx[n+1][j-1]` for `j` from 1 to `n`.

Output: **nx (where nx is a string composed of 'F' and 'S' based on the conditions of xx[n+1][j-1] for j from 1 to n)**
