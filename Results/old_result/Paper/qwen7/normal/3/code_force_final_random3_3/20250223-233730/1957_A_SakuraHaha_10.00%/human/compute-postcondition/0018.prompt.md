Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a dictionary with multiple key-value pairs where each key is an element from the original list `a` and each value is the count of occurrences of that element in the original list `a`.

This final state occurs because the loop iterates over each element in the list `a`, updating the `cnt` dictionary to keep track of how many times each element appears. After all elements have been processed, the list `a` becomes empty, and `cnt` contains the counts of each unique element from the original list.
Code of the loop:
for x in cnt.values():
    ans += x // 4


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is 0 + x // 4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` must have at least one value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is 0 + x // 4 + x // 4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` must have at least one less value

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is 0 + x // 4 + x // 4 + x // 4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least two values




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
