Output State: **`max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 2`, the `results` list now contains 1, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 3)`, `x` is the next value from `test_cases`, `y` is `x - 3`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 3)**

Explanation: The code updates `gcd_val` to the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` (which is `x - 3`). All other variables remain in their previous states.
