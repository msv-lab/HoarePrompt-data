Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u ≤ n, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `t`. The value of `t` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state, so it remains unchanged. The values of `u` and `v` are not directly assigned in this code snippet, so they retain their initial conditions. The value of `n` is updated to the value read from input, which is within the specified range. The list of starting nodes condition also remains unchanged.
