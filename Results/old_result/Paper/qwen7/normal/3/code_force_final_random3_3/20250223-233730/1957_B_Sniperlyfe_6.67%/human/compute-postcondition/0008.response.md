Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is `k - ((k - (1 << (k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)) - (1 << (k.bit_length() - 1) - 1) - 1)`, `n` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list with its first element set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and its second element set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and `nums[3]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `nums[i]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, where `i` is 3. The value of `k` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it. The other variables (`n` and the initial elements of `nums`) also remain unchanged.
