### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given solution step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.
   - Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes.
   - Fireworks from the second installation are launched every `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution checks different conditions based on the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `m`.

3. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1:** `m < a` and `m < b`
     - If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, the solution prints `2`. This is because the first and second installations will have their first fireworks visible at different times, and subsequent launches will not overlap within the visibility period `m + 1`.
   - **Case 2:** `m < a` and `m > b`
     - If `m` is less than `a` but greater than `b`, the solution prints `2 + m // b`. This accounts for the initial two fireworks plus additional fireworks from the second installation.
   - **Case 3:** `m < b` and `m > a`
     - If `m` is less than `b` but greater than `a`, the solution prints `2 + m // a`. This accounts for the initial two fireworks plus additional fireworks from the first installation.
   - **Case 4:** Otherwise
     - If neither of the above conditions holds, the solution prints `m // a + m // b + 2`. This accounts for the initial two fireworks plus the maximum number of additional fireworks from both installations.

4. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify each case with examples:
     - **Case 1:** `m < a` and `m < b`
       - Example: `a = 6`, `b = 7`, `m = 4`
         - First fireworks: `4` and `5` (from `a` and `b` respectively)
         - No overlap since `4` and `5` are not within the same interval.
         - Correctly prints `2`.
     - **Case 2:** `m < a` and `m > b`
       - Example: `a = 6`, `b = 4`, `m = 5`
         - First fireworks: `5` and `6` (from `a` and `b` respectively)
         - Additional fireworks: `6` and `7` (from `b`)
         - Correctly prints `2 + 5 // 4 = 2 + 1 = 3`.
     - **Case 3:** `m < b` and `m > a`
       - Example: `a = 4`, `b = 6`, `m = 5`
         - First fireworks: `5` and `6` (from `a` and `b` respectively)
         - Additional fireworks: `6` and `7` (from `a`)
         - Correctly prints `2 + 5 // 4 = 2 + 1 = 3`.
     - **Case 4:** Otherwise
       - Example: `a = 5`, `b = 6`, `m = 78123459896`
         - First fireworks: `78123459896` and `78123459897` (from `a` and `b` respectively)
         - Additional fireworks: `78123459896` and `78123459897` (from `a` and `b` respectively)
         - Correctly prints `78123459896 // 5 + 78123459896 // 6 + 2 = 15624691979 + 13020743317 + 2 = 28645268630 + 2 = 28645268632`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Consider the edge case where `a` and `b` are relatively prime and `m` is large enough to allow multiple overlaps. The current logic correctly handles these cases as well.

### Conclusion:
After re-evaluating the solution with detailed examples and edge cases, we can confirm that the given solution correctly handles all scenarios described in the problem statement.
