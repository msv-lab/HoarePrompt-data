### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum equals `k`, and the number of `1`s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR is maximized.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is handled well by the outer loop.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes `n` and `k` as parameters.
   - It initializes a list `nums` with `n` zeros.
   - It sets each element of `nums` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This value is the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits (i.e., `2^(k.bit_length()) - 1`).
   - It subtracts this value from `k` for each iteration.
   - Finally, it adjusts the last element to ensure the sum of the list equals `k`.

4. **Binary Representation and Bitwise OR**:
   - The value `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` is a number with `k.bit_length()` bits all set to `1`.
   - Using this value ensures that each element contributes the maximum possible number of `1`s in the binary representation.
   - However, this approach may not always maximize the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR of the entire sequence because it doesn't consider the bitwise OR across all elements.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For small values of `k`, the approach might work as expected.
   - For larger values of `k`, the approach might not be optimal. For example, if `k` is a power of 2, setting all elements to `k-1` might not maximize the bitwise OR. Instead, a better strategy would be to use smaller numbers that contribute to the bitwise OR effectively.

6. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program correctly formats the output by joining the elements of `nums` with spaces and joining the results of all test cases with newlines.

### Detailed Analysis:

Let's consider a few examples to understand why the current implementation might not be optimal:

- **Example 1**: `n = 2`, `k = 3`
  - The function sets both elements to `1` (since `1 << 3.bit_length() - 1 - 1` is `1`), resulting in `[1, 1]`. The bitwise OR is `1 | 1 = 1`, which has only one `1`.
  - An optimal solution would be `[3, 0]` or `[0, 3]`, which gives a bitwise OR of `3`, having three `1`s.

- **Example 2**: `n = 3`, `k = 5`
  - The function sets the first two elements to `1` and the third to `3` (since `1 << 5.bit_length() - 1 - 1` is `1`), resulting in `[1, 1, 3]`. The bitwise OR is `1 | 1 | 3 = 3`, which has two `1`s.
  - An optimal solution would be `[5, 0, 0]`, which gives a bitwise OR of `5`, having three `1`s.

From these examples, it is clear that the current implementation does not always maximize the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR. A better approach would involve distributing the value of `k` among the elements in a way that maximizes the bitwise OR.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was accurate. The provided solution does not guarantee the optimal solution for all cases. Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem statement.
