Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `inp` is a non-empty tuple containing integers from the input split by spaces, `x` is \(n + 1\), `y` is equal to the second element of `inp`, `ans` is 2 if the third element in `inp` is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise `ans` is 1, and `a` is the second element of `inp`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was previously set to 1 if the third element in `inp` was less than or equal to `x`, or 0 otherwise, incrementing it by 1 changes its value to 2 if it was 1, or 1 if it was 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
