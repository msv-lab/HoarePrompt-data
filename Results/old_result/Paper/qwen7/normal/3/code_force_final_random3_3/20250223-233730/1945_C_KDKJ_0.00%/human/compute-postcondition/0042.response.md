Postcondition: `i` is 0, `left` is `S[0][0]`, `lsum` is `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`. If the condition `(left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum)` is true, the function does nothing. Otherwise, `i` is assigned to `ans`, and the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`.
