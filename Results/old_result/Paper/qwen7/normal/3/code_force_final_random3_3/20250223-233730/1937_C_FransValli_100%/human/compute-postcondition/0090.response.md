Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is greater than 1 but its exact value is not specified.
- `res` is an input string, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `maxi` is explicitly given as 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

Breaking down the print statement:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `maxi` is 1.
- `maxi` again is 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `i` again is 2.

So, the print statement will output these values in sequence.

Output: **'? 1 1 2 2'**
