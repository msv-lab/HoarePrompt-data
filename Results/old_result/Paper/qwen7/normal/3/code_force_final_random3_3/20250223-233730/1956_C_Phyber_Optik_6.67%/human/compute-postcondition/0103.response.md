Output State: **`j` is `2 * n + 2`, `n` is an input integer, `r` is `n`, `t` is `t - n * n`, `i` is `n`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to `n`. The other variables (`j`, `r`, `t`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `j` is calculated as `2 * n + 2`, `r` is equal to `n`, `t` is reduced by `n * n`, and `i` is equal to `n`.
