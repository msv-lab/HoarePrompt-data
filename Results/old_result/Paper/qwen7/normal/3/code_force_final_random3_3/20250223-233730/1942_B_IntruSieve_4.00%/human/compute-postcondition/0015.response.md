Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0, `minn` is the minimum value of `arr[0]`, `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between `arr[0]` and `minn`.**

Explanation: The code appends to the list `mex` the absolute difference between `arr[i]` (which is `arr[0]` since `i` starts at 0) and `minn` (the minimum value of `arr[0]`). Since `i` was initially 0, after executing the line, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 1. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
