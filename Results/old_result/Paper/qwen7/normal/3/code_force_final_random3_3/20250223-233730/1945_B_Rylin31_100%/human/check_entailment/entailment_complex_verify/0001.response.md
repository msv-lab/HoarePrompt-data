### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided solution is incorrect. The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not accurately account for the overlaps and simultaneous visibility of fireworks from both installations. 

To correctly solve this problem, we need to use the inclusion-exclusion principle to account for the overlaps. Specifically, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from each installation and subtract the overlaps.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1. **Number of Fireworks from Each Installation**:
   - The number of fireworks from the first installation within the interval `[0, m]` is `m // a + 1`.
   - The number of fireworks from the second installation within the interval `[0, m]` is `m // b + 1`.

2. **Overlap Calculation**:
   - The least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` is needed to find the period after which the patterns of launches repeat.
   - The number of fireworks from both installations within the interval `[0, m]` is `m // lcm(a, b) + 1`.

3. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**:
   - The total number of fireworks visible simultaneously is given by:
     \[
     \text{Total} = (m // a + 1) + (m // b + 1) - (m // \text{lcm}(a, b) + 1)
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     \text{Total} = m // a + m // b - m // \text{lcm}(a, b)
     \]

The provided solution does not implement this logic, leading to incorrect results as demonstrated in the example cases.

### Conclusion

The original assessment correctly identified the flaw in the provided solution. The provided solution does not account for the overlaps properly, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
