Based on the initial state provided:

- `no_path` is `False`.
- `i` is `i_current + 1`.
- `n` is an integer greater than 4.
- `k` is 3.
- `a` is a new string input by the user.
- `b` is the new input string.
- The current value of `a[k]` is not `'>'`.

The `print(k)` statement will print the value of the variable `k`, which is explicitly stated to be 3.

Output: **3**
