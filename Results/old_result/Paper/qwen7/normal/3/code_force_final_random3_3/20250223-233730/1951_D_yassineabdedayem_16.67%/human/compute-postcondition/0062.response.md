Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `n != 0`, `k > 0`, `rep < 60`, and `n >= k`.

2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `rep` is 0.
   - `k` is adjusted according to the loop's conditions.
   - `tab` is an empty list.
   - `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration.
   - `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration.
   - `i` is the last element of `tab`.
   - `t` is decreased by 1 (`t-1`).
   - `number` is 0.

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - `rep` is 0, and the condition `rep < 60` is trivially true since `rep` starts at 0.
   - `k` is adjusted according to the loop's conditions, but we don't know its exact value yet.
   - `tab` is an empty list, and this doesn't affect the loop condition directly.
   - `Min` and `Max` are based on the previous iteration values of `n` and `k`, and they don't affect the current loop condition.
   - `i` is the last element of `tab`, and since `tab` is empty, `i` is irrelevant.
   - `t` is decreased by 1, and this doesn't affect the loop condition.
   - `number` is 0, and this doesn't affect the loop condition.

4. **Check the remaining conditions**:
   - `n != 0`: We need `n` to be non-zero for the loop to execute.
   - `k > 0`: We need `k` to be positive for the loop to execute.
   - `n >= k`: We need `n` to be greater than or equal to `k` for the loop to execute.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that `n` is non-zero, `k` is positive, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `n` is not specified explicitly, we assume it needs to be non-zero.
   - `k` must be positive.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` being non-zero and `k` being positive.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be non-zero, `k` must be positive**
