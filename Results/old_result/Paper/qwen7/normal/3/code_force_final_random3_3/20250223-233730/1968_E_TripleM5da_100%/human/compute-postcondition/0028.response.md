Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 13, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 13.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the input. The value of `i` is incremented from 12 to 13 to allow the loop to continue. Additionally, `n` must be at least 13 to satisfy the condition for the loop to continue executing.
