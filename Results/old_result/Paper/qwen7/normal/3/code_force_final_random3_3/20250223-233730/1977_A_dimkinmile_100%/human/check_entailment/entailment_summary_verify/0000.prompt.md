You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes two integers, \( n \) and \( m \), and checks if their difference (\( n - m \)) is even and non-negative. If the condition is met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but modifies the output based on the given conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is less than `m`. According to the problem description, Nikita can only add or remove exactly one cube per move. Therefore, the difference between `n` and `m` must be even and non-negative for it to be possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. However, the current implementation checks only if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`, which is not sufficient.

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `m = 4`. Here, `n - m = -2`, which is not greater than or equal to 0, but it is still impossible to achieve 4 cubes after 2 moves because the maximum number of cubes that can be added is 2. The program would incorrectly output "Yes" for this case.

To fix this, the condition should check if `abs(n - m)` is even and non-negative. Here is the corrected version:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if abs(n - m) % 2 == 0 and abs(n - m) >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This ensures that the program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
