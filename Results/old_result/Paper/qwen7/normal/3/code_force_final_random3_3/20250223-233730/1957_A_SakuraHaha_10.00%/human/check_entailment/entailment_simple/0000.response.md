Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not match the actual code provided. The actual code initializes `t` but does not use it in the loop, which means it only processes one test case regardless of the value of `t`. This is a discrepancy between the expected behavior based on the problem statement and the actual implementation.
2. The function `func_1()` is called without using the value of `t` from the input, meaning it will only process one test case. However, the problem requires processing multiple test cases based on the value of `t`.
3. The logic inside `func_1()` correctly calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed, but this logic should be applied to each test case.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
