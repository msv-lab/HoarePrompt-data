State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains three variables: `i`, `n`, and the range function which implicitly uses `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `n > 0` must be true because the `range(n)` function will generate a sequence from 0 to `n-1`.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, as per the default behavior of the `range` function.
4. The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop's execution condition and its value does not affect whether the loop runs or not.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` to ensure it is greater than 0, and `i` to be set to 0, as these are the variables that determine the loop's execution.
