Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to decode the encoded string, but it contains a logical error in the `func_1` function. The function tries to create a mapping from characters in the alphabet to characters in the encoded string, but it does not correctly reverse the encoding process.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Mapping Creation**: The function creates a mapping where each character in the alphabet (`'a'` to `'z'`) is mapped to a character in the encoded string. However, this mapping is not correct because it does not account for the symmetry required in the encoding process.

2. **Decoding Process**: When decoding, the function appends characters to `decoded` based on the current character in the encoded string. This approach does not correctly reverse the encoding process because it does not consider the symmetry in the mapping.

To fix this, we need to correctly reverse the encoding process. Here's a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Create the auxiliary string r with unique characters sorted alphabetically
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    
    # Create a mapping from r to its reversed positions
    mapping = {char: r[-(i+1)] for i, char in enumerate(r)}
    
    # Decode the encoded string using the mapping
    decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    
    return decoded
```

This corrected function works as follows:
1. It first creates the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters of the encoded string.
2. It then creates a mapping from each character in `r` to its corresponding symmetric character in `r`.
3. Finally, it decodes the encoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its symmetric character from the mapping.

With this corrected function, the program should work as expected to decode the encoded strings.
