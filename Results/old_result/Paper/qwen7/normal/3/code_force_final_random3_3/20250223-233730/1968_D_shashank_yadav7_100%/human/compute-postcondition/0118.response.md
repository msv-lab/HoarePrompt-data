Output State: **`k` is an integer, `b` is `int(input())`, `s` is `int(input())`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] + sp + n * a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp + n * a[b]`, `i` is `n + 1`, and either `bm` is greater than `sm` or `bm` is less than or equal to `sm` after the if-else block executes.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers and converts them into a list of integers. This list is assigned to the variable `a`. All other variables (`k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, `i`) remain unchanged in terms of their relationships and conditions. The only new information is that `a` now holds the newly read list of integers.
