Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `mdx` to `n-1`. The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `mdx + 1`
   - `n` must be greater than `mdx`
   - If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `mdx + 2`.

5. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is now `mdx + 2`, the condition `i < n` must hold true.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be `mdx + 2`.
   - `n` must still be greater than `mdx`.
   - The value of `res` remains unchanged unless `a[mdx] == a[i]` (which would happen if `i` was `mdx + 1`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `mdx + 2`, `n` must be greater than `mdx`, and if `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**
