Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is between 0 and `n-1`, `n` is at least 1, `cnt` is 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`**.

The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, so `cnt` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
