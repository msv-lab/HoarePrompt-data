Output State: **`eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from `range(n + 1)` for which `q[j] > 0`; `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`.**

Explanation: The line `eta_ln = len(eta)` calculates the length of the list `eta` and assigns it to the variable `eta_ln`. The list `eta` remains unchanged and contains all the indices from `0` to `n` (inclusive) where the corresponding elements in `q` are greater than 0. The variable `n` is also unchanged and holds its previous value, which is the condition for the range of indices in `eta`.
