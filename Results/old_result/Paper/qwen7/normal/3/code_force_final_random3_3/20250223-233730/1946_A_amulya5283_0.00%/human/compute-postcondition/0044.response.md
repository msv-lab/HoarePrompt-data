Output State: `results` is [number of elements in heap - the total number of operations (which is 5 in this case)], `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in heap + 6, `operations` is 5, `heap` is now a min-heap containing `arr[median_index + 1:]` with the smallest element being `current_median + 1`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `smallest + 1`, `smallest` is the second smallest element from the original heap after removing the smallest element.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the heap will contain `arr[median_index + 1:]` because each iteration removes the smallest element from the heap and pushes `smallest + 1` back into the heap. The loop runs until the smallest element in the heap is no longer less than or equal to `current_median`. Since the loop executed 5 times, it means 5 elements were processed, reducing the size of the heap by 5. The `operations` count is 5, and the `current_median` is updated to `smallest + 1` after each iteration, where `smallest` is the second smallest element from the original heap after the first smallest has been removed.
