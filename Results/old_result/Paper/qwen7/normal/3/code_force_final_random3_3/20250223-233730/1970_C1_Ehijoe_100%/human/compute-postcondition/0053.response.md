Postcondition: `tree` now contains the current element either `nodes[curr][1]` or `nodes[curr][0]`, depending on whether `nodes[curr][0]` equals `prev`. If `nodes[curr][0]` equals `prev`, then `tree` has one more element `nodes[curr][1]`. Otherwise, `tree` has one more element `prev`, and `prev` is equal to `nodes[curr][0]`.
