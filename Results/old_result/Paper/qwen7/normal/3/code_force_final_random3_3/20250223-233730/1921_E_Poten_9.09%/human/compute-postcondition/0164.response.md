Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The initial value of `i` is 1, so after the increment (even though not explicitly shown in the code, it's implied by the next step), `i` becomes 2. The precondition that `test_cases` must be greater than 0 and `clues` is a list of integers remains unchanged.
