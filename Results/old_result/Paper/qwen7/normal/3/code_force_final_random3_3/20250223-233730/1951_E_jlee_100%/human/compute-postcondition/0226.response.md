Output State: **`j` is assigned the value of `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is a character, `count` is less than 1, and either the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`, in which case `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken, or the character at index `j` in string `s` is equal to `x` and `count` is incremented by 1. We continue the loop or if statement.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables and the loop or if statement continues, the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as before the `continue` statement was executed.
