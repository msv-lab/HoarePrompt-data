Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `arr` must have at least 3 elements.
   - `item` is `arr[3]`. This means `item` is the fourth element of the list `arr` because list indices start from 0.
   - `res` is an input string.
   - `mini` is unchanged if `res` was '>', otherwise `mini` is set to `arr[3]`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
   ```

Given the initial state:
- `mini` could either be `arr[3]` (if `res` was not '>') or some other value (if `res` was '>').
- `item` is explicitly defined as `arr[3]`.

Since the exact value of `res` is not specified, we need to consider both scenarios:
- If `res` is not '>', then `mini` remains unchanged, and it is `arr[3]`.
- If `res` is '>', then `mini` is set to `arr[3]`.

In both cases, `mini` and `item` are the same, which is `arr[3]`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **'? [arr[3]] [arr[3]] [arr[3]] [arr[3]]'**
