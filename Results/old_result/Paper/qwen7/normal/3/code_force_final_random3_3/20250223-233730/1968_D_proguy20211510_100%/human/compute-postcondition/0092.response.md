Output State: **`pres` is equal to `paths[4] * (k - 3) + paths[i]`, `curr` is the result of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`, `i` is `i + 1`, `ress` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr`.**

Explanation: The line `ress = max(ress, curr)` updates the value of `ress` to be the maximum between its current value and `curr`. All other variables (`pres`, `curr`, `i`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
