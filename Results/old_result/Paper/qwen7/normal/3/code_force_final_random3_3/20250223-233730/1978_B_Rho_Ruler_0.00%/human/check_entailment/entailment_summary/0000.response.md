Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to find the optimal value of \( k \) using binary search to maximize the profit. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Objective of Binary Search**: The binary search is not correctly used to find the maximum profit. Instead, it seems to be an attempt to find a value of \( k \) such that the profit does not exceed \( n \times \max(a, b) \). This is not the objective of the problem.

2. **Profit Calculation in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` calculates the total profit as `k * b + (n - k) * a` and checks if this value is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. This condition is not relevant to finding the maximum profit. The correct condition should be checking if the calculated profit is greater than any previously found profit.

3. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic is flawed because it updates `low` and `high` incorrectly based on the result of `func_1`. The goal should be to maximize the profit, not to find a value of \( k \) that satisfies a certain condition.

4. **Final Output**: The final output of the binary search is stored in `ans`, which might not represent the maximum profit. The binary search should update the maximum profit found so far.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
