Output State: The value of `power` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to the logarithm base 2 of `n`. Given the conditions provided, the loop continues to increment `power` until it is no longer less than the logarithm base 2 of `n`. Since the loop executed 3 times to reach `power` being 4, we can infer that `n` must be at least 16 (since \(2^4 = 16\)). Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, `power` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\log_2(n)\).

So, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least \(2^{\text{power}}\) where `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\log_2(n)\), and `power` is the final value of the `power` variable after the loop has completed.
