Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n` is updated to the first input integer, `a` is updated to the second input integer, `b` is updated to the third input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The initial values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged except that now `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values of the inputs.
