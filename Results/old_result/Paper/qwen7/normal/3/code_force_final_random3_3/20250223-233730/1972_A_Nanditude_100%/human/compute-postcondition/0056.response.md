Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n + 1`, `cnt` is either 0 or `n + 1` (depending on the values in lists `a` and `b`), `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial states.
