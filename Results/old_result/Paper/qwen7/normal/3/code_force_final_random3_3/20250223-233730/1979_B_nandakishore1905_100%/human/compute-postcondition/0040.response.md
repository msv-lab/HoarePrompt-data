Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.**

The code calculates the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and assigns it to `k`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `m` remains an input integer. Therefore, the output state includes these updated details.
