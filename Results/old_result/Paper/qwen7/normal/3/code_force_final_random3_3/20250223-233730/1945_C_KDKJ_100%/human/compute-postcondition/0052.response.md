Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and conditions:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n` (inclusive), as specified by `range(n + 1)`.

2. **Determine the initial state before the loop starts:**
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `left` is `S[i][0]`.
   - `lsum` is `i`.
   - `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`.
   - `rsum` is `n - i`.
   - If the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be the value it was at the end of the last iteration.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will increment by 1.
   - The other variables (`left`, `lsum`, `right`, `rsum`, and `ans`) depend on the current value of `i` and will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.

4. **Calculate the new values:**
   - `left` will be `S[i+1][0]` (since `i` increases by 1).
   - `lsum` will be `i + 1` (since `lsum` is `i` plus 1).
   - `right` will be `S[-1][1] - S[i+1][1]` (since `i` increases by 1).
   - `rsum` will be `n - (i + 1)` (since `rsum` is `n - i` minus 1).

5. **Determine the condition for updating `ans`:**
   - The condition for updating `ans` is based on the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` being less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `n` is still greater than or equal to 0.
- `left` is `S[i+1][0]`.
- `lsum` is `i + 1`.
- `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i+1][1]`.
- `rsum` is `n - (i + 1)`.
- `ans` will either remain unchanged or be updated if the condition is met.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `left` is `S[i+1][0]`, `lsum` is `i + 1`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i+1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (i + 1)`, `ans` is unchanged or updated based on the condition.**
