Output State: **`vx` has at least 2 elements, `v1` is removed from `vx`, `v2` is now the element at index len(`vx`) - 1**

Explanation: The code removes the element at index `len(vx) - 2` (which was stored in `v1`) from the list `vx`. After the removal, `v2`, which was the element at index `len(vx) - 1` before the removal, is now at index `len(vx) - 1` because one element has been removed from the list. The length of `vx` is reduced by one, but `v2` refers to the new last element of the updated list.
