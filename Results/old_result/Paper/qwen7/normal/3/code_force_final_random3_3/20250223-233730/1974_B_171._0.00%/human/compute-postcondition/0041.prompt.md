Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `char` is the next character in `encoded`, `decoded` either has one more element than before with the last element being the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`, or `decoded` remains unchanged, `c` is 122, `char` remains unchanged from its initial value
Code of the loop:
for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
    if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
        mapping[chr(c)] = char
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `c` must be within the range 97 to 123 (inclusive), `char` is the next character in `encoded`, and `decoded` remains unchanged unless `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, in which case `decoded` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `c` must be within the range 98 to 124 (inclusive), `char` is the next character in `encoded`, and `decoded` remains unchanged unless `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`. If `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, then `mapping[chr(c)]` is set to `char` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `c` must be within the range 99 to 124 (inclusive), `char` is the next character in `encoded`, and `decoded` remains unchanged unless `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`. If `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, then `mapping[chr(c)]` is set to `char` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
