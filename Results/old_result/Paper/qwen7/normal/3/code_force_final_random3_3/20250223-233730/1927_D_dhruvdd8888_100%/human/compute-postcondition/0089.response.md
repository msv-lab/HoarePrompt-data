Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers `nums` and handles a series of queries. It identifies the positions where the elements in `nums` change and then, for each query defined by indices `l` and `r`, determines if the subarray from `l` to `r-1` contains any changes. If the subarray contains a change, it outputs the start and end indices of the first change within the subarray. If no change is found or the subarray is invalid, it outputs `-1 -1`. The function does not return any value but prints the results of each query.**
