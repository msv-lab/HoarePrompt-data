Output State: **`mak` is 2, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variable values or conditions. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. Therefore, the values of `mak`, `i`, and the condition on `n` remain unchanged.
