Output State: **`i` is 5; `num` is `ar[5]`**

The code assigns the value of `ar[i]` to the variable `num`. Given that `i` is 5, `num` is set to the element at index 5 of the list `ar`. The precondition that `len(ar)` must be greater than 3 is still valid since it was true before the code execution and does not get affected by the assignment.
