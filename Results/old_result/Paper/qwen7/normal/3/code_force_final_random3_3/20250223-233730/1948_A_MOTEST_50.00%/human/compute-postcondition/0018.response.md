Output State: **`ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 2, `x` is now `x_prev + 2`, `j` is `j_prev + 2` and must be less than `n // 2`, and `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus 2 times the value of `s[x]`.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated to its previous value plus twice the value of `s[x]`. All other conditions and variable states remain as initially described, with `x` and `j` being updated according to their respective rules.
