Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `trumps` is a list that is sorted and must not be empty.
   
2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - `trumps.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the list `trumps`.
   - Since `trumps` is not empty, the first call to `trumps.pop()` will remove and return the last element of `trumps`.
   - The returned element is then concatenated with `trump` and a space, followed by another call to `trumps.pop()`, which removes and returns the new last element of `trumps`.
   - This second returned element is then concatenated with `trump`.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - Let's denote the last element of `trumps` as `last_element` and the second-to-last element of `trumps` as `second_last_element`.
   - After the first `pop`, `last_element` is removed and returned.
   - After the second `pop`, `second_last_element` is removed and returned.
   - The print statement will thus output: `{last_element}{trump} {second_last_element}{trump}`.

Given this reasoning, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **{last_element}{trump} {second_last_element}{trump} (where last_element is the last element of trumps, second_last_element is the second-to-last element of trumps, and trump is a variable whose value is not specified)**
