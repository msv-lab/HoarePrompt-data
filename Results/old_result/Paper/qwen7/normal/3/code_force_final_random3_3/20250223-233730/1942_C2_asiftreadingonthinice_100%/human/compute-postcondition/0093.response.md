Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from 1 to the length of `a`.
   - Therefore, `i` starts from 1 and goes up to the length of `a` (exclusive).

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` would be 3 if the loop condition allows it.

5. **Check the Loop Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop condition is `range(1, len(a))`, so `i` must be less than `len(a)` for the loop to continue.
   - If `i` is 3, then `i < len(a)` must hold true for the loop to execute again.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `a` remains the same list of integers.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers**
