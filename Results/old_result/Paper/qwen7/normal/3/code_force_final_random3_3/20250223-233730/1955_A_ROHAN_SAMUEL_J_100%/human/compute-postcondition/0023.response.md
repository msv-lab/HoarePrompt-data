Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
- `n` is an integer from the input.
- `a` is an integer from the input.

The `print(a * n)` statement will print the product of `a` and `n`.

Since `a` and `n` are explicitly stated to be integers from the input, their values will be used directly in the multiplication.

Output: **a * n (where a and n are integers from the input)**
