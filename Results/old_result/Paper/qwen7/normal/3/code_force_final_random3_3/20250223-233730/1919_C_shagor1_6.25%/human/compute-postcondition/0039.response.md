Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\).
- `inp` is a non-empty tuple containing integers from the input split by spaces.
- `x` is the minimum value in `inp`.
- `y` is the second smallest value in `inp` if there are at least two distinct elements in `inp`, otherwise `y` is `x` or remains \(n + 1\) if no smaller elements are found.
- `ans` is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

To determine the precise value of `ans`, we need to know the specific values of `inp`, `x`, and `y`. However, since these values are not explicitly given, we can only describe `ans` in terms of the conditions provided.

Output: **ans (where ans is the count of elements in inp that are greater than both x and y)**
