Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n // 2):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initially set to `i`, and according to the given state, `i` is equal to `t`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j < n // 2`. Given that `j` is initially `t` (which must be at least 1), the loop will execute if `t < n // 2`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` is initially `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is less than `n // 2` for the loop to execute.
   - We also need to ensure that `j` is initialized to `t` and is less than `n // 2 - 1` at the start of the loop, as per the given condition.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `t`, `n`, and `j`.

**Final State**:
- `t` must be less than `n // 2` to ensure the loop can execute.
- `j` must be initialized to `t` and should be less than `n // 2 - 1` at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the state after adjustment is:
State: **`t` must be less than `n // 2`, `i` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is '', `x` is 0, `j` is less than `n // 2 - 1`**
