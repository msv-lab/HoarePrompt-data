Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `4` to `n` (inclusive). This means `j` starts at `4` and increments until it reaches `n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be at least 4.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts at `4` and increments by `1` each time, the loop will continue as long as `j < n`.
   - After the previous iteration, `j` was at its maximum value, which is `n-1` (since the loop runs up to `n-1`).
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `j` will be `n` and the loop will check if `n` is still greater than `n-1` (which is always true).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - The variable `j` will be set to `n`.
   - The condition `n` must be at least 4 remains unchanged because the loop will continue as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 4.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`n` must be at least 4, `j` is `n`**.

However, since the problem specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, and `j` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, we should focus on the variable `n`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**`n` must be at least 5**.

This is because `j` will be incremented to `n` in the next iteration, and for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than `j`, which was `n-1` in the previous iteration. Hence, `n` must be at least `5` for the loop to execute one more time.
