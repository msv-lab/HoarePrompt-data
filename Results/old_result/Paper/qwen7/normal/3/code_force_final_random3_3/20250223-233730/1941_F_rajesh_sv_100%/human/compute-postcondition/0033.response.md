Output State: **`max_diff` is `diff`, `next_max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred (or None if not applicable), `i` is 7.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `diff` to `max_diff`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `diff` is specifically defined as `A[6] - A[5]`, `max_diff` now holds this value. The states of `next_max_diff`, `index`, and `i` remain as they were initially.
