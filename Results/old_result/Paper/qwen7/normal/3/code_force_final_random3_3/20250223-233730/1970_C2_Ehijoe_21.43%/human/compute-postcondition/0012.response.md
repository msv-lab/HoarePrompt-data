Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `u` is an input integer (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).
   - `v` is an input integer (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).
   - `nodes[v]` now contains `u` (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`, and `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\)**.
