Output State: `t` is equal to 0; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the input split, `x` is the integer value of the second element of the input split, `y` is the integer value of the third element of the input split, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from converting the first `x` elements of the input split into integers.

This output state occurs because the loop continues to execute as long as `t > 0`. After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1. Therefore, if the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will eventually reach 0. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their last state within the loop, as these values are determined by the input during each iteration and not modified within the loop itself.
