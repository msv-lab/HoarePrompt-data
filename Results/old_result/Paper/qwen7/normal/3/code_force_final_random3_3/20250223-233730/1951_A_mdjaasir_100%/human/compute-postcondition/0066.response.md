Functionality: **The function processes multiple inputs consisting of integers and strings. For each input, it counts the number of '1's in a given string. Based on the count, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO'. After processing all inputs, it outputs the final values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `count`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.**
