Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Other variables (`n` and `k`) are not yet defined.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    rep = 0
    number = 0
    tab = []
    while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
        Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
        if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
            number = Min
            k = k - Max
        else:
            number = Max
            k = k - Min
        tab.append(str(number))
        n -= Min * Max
        rep += 1
    if k == 0:
        print('YES')
        print(len(tab))
        for i in tab:
            print(i, end=' ')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is reduced to 0 or less, `k` is adjusted according to the loop's conditions, `rep` is 60, `tab` contains the sequence of numbers generated during the loop's execution, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration, and `i` is the last element of `tab`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `rep` is 60, `k` is adjusted according to the loop's conditions, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of numbers from each iteration of the loop, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration, `i` is the last element of `tab`, `t` is 59, `number` is 0, and `k` is not equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total` is 0, `students` is 2 less than its initial value, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k` for the final iteration, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k` for the final iteration, `number` is either `Min` if `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `number` is `Max` for the final iteration, `k` is adjusted to `k - Max` if `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `k` is adjusted to `k - Min` for the final iteration, `rep` is 60 (since the loop runs up to 60 iterations), `n` is 0 (as it is reduced by `Min * Max` each iteration until it reaches 0), and `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` from each iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
