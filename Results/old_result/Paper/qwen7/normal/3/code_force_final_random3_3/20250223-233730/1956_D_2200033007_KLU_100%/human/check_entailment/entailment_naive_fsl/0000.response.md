Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are intended to solve the problem, but they do not follow the logic required to maximize the sum of the array elements through the allowed operations. Specifically, these functions seem to be implementing a dynamic programming approach to find the maximum subarray sum, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

The problem requires finding the maximum sum of the array elements by performing operations that set a segment of the array to the MEX of that segment. However, the provided functions do not address this requirement. Instead, they appear to be attempting to partition the array into subarrays and calculate their sums, which is not the correct approach.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
Input:
4
1 100 2 1
```
The expected output would be:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
However, the provided program does not produce the correct output. The program does not correctly identify segments to set to the MEX value, and it does not maximize the sum of the array elements as required by the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
