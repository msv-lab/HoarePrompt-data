Postcondition: `i` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the original value of `n`; `n` must be greater than 3; `s` is a string input by the user. If `s` is '<', then `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`. If `s` is not '<' and equals '=', then `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`. If `s` is neither '<' nor '=', then `pans` remains unchanged.
