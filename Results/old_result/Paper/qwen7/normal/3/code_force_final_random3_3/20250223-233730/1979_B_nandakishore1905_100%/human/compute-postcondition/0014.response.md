Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is equal to `t`; `m` is the second integer input split from the same input line; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`; `k` is not a power of two and `k` is even; `l` is the string representation of the binary form of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `p` is the length of `l`; `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).**

Explanation: The code calculates `q` as \(2^{(p - 1)}\), where `p` is the length of the binary representation of `k`. Since `k` is given to be even and not a power of two, `p` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`. After calculating `q`, the other variables remain unchanged.
