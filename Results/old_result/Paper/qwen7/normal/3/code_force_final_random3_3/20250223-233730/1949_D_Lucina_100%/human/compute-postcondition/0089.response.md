Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `xx` is a list containing the string `x`.
   - `a` is a list with counts of 'F' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`.
   - `b` is a list with counts of 'S' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is `2`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `1` to `n + 1`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `2`.

4. **Loop Execution:**
   - For `j = 2`, the loop will check the condition `x[j - 1]` (which is `x[1]`).
   - If `x[1]` is 'F', then `a[2]` is set to `2`.
   - If `x[1]` is 'S', then `b[1]` is incremented by `1`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `j`.
   - After the first iteration (`j = 2`), `j` will be incremented to `3` for the next iteration.

6. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be `3`.
   - The loop will check `x[2]` (since `j - 1` will be `2`).

7. **Final State:**
   - `j` will be `3` for the next iteration.
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `xx`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`xx` is a list containing the string `x`, `a` is a list with counts of 'F' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`, `b` is a list with counts of 'S' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `3***.
