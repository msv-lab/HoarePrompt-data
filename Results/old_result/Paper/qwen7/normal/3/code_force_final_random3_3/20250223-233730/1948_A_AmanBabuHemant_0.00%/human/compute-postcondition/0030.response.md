Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, and if `n` is odd, `n` remains odd. If `n` is even, `n` remains even, and `s` is a string consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times.** 

Explanation: The code `s = '110' * (n // 2)` assigns the value `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times to the variable `s`. The conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The length of `s` is determined by the value of `n`, but the precondition that the length of `s` is either less than 200 or 200 or more is still valid.
