### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Setup**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the number of piles (`n`) and the sizes of the piles (`arr`) for each test case.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the list of pile sizes (`arr`).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function starts by creating a set of unique elements from `arr` and sorting it.
   - If the smallest element in the sorted set is not 1, the function immediately returns 'Alice', indicating that Alice can win by removing 1 stone from each pile on her first turn.
   - If the smallest element is 1, the function enters a loop to check the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted set.
   - The loop checks if the difference between any two consecutive elements is greater than 1. If such a difference is found, `not_c` is set to `False`, and the loop breaks.
   - The variable `A` alternates between `True` and `False` during each iteration of the loop.
   - After the loop, if `not_c` is still `False`, `A` is toggled again.
   - Finally, the function returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True` and 'Bob' if `A` is `False`.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the game rules and determines the winner based on the conditions specified in the problem statement.
   - The function handles all edge cases, such as when the smallest element is not 1, and when the differences between consecutive elements are always 1.
   - The alternating logic for `A` ensures that the final decision is made correctly based on the parity of the number of valid moves.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description and test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
