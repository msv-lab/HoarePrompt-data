Output State: **`vx` must contain at least 3 elements, `v1` is now the second last element of `vx`, `v2` is the new second last element of `vx`, and `ops` is a list containing two tuples. If `v2` is greater than 0, then the tuples are (`v2`, `v2`) and (`v1`, `v2`). Otherwise, the tuples are (0, 0) and (v1, 0).**

Explanation: The code updates the values of `v1` and `v2` to be the second last and last elements of `vx`, respectively. The conditions for `ops` remain unchanged based on the new values of `v1` and `v2`.
