Output State: **`j` is 2, `eta_ln` must be at least 2, `res` is `res` plus `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing it from 1 to 2. The value of `res` is updated by adding the expression `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`, where `eta[j]` is now `eta[2]`. The precondition that `eta_ln` must be at least 2 remains unchanged.
