Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple unpacking `(v1, v2) = ops[::-1]`. This means the loop is iterating over the reversed list `ops`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ops` is a list with its last element being the result of appending `v1` to the list (`p2` if `p1[-1] == v2` else `p1`).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `ops` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over the reversed list `ops`, the next iteration will use the second-to-last element of the current `ops`.
   - The last element of `ops` at the end of the previous iteration will be removed for the next iteration.

5. **Update the state**:
   - Remove the last element from `ops`.
   - The new last element (which was the second-to-last before removal) becomes the current last element.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- The last element of `ops` at the end of the previous iteration was the result of appending `v1` to the list (`p2` if `p1[-1] == v2` else `p1`).
- For the next iteration, this last element will be removed from `ops`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the last element of `ops` has been removed.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ops` is a list with its last element being the result of appending `v1` to the list (`p2` if `p1[-1] == v2` else `p1`), but the last element has been removed**.
