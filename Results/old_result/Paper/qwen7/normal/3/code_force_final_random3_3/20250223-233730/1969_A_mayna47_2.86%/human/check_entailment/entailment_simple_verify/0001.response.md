### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.
2. **Friend List Initialization**: In `func_1()`, the program initializes a list `v` with zeros and then updates it with the input values. This is done correctly.
3. **Special Case Handling**: For `n == 2`, the program prints `2` which is correct because both friends need to be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come. This part is correct.
4. **Main Logic**:
   - The program checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and are also best friends with each other indirectly (i.e., `v[v[v[i]]] == i`). If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns, which is correct.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`. However, this logic needs to be checked more carefully.
5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where inviting just one friend is sufficient. For example, in the third test case (`2 1`), inviting just friend 1 would suffice, but the program incorrectly prints `2`.
   - The program does not ensure that the minimum number of invitations is always printed. For example, in the third test case, the program should check if inviting just one friend is enough, but it directly prints `2`.

### Analysis:

- The program correctly identifies the special case when `n == 2` and prints `2` because both friends need to be invited.
- The main logic of checking if `v[v[v[i]]] == i` is correct for identifying pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and are also best friends with each other indirectly. However, the program does not check if inviting just one friend is sufficient.
- The program directly prints `3` without checking if inviting just one friend is enough, which is incorrect.

### Corrected Logic:

To fix the issue, we need to add a check before printing `3` to see if inviting just one friend is sufficient. Specifically, we need to check if any friend `i` satisfies `v[i] == i`. If such a friend exists, then inviting just that friend is sufficient, and we should print `1`.

Here is the corrected logic:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if n == 2:
        print(2)
        return
    
    # Check if there is a friend who is their own best friend
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[i] == i:
            print(1)
            return
    
    # Check if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and are also best friends with each other indirectly
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
    
    # If none of the above conditions are met, print 3
    print(3)
```

### Conclusion:

With the added checks, the program now correctly identifies the minimum number of invitations needed. Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate because it did not account for the possibility of inviting just one friend in some cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
