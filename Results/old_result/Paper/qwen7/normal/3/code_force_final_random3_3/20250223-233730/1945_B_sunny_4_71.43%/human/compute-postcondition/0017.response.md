Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables t, a, b, and m, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and a, b, and m are integers between 1 and 10^18. For each test case defined by t, the function performs operations using a, b, and m and returns a result based on these inputs.**

This means the function indirectly accepts four parameters: `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m`. It processes these parameters within its scope and returns a result for each test case defined by `t`.
