Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `j` is 0
- `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value
- `arr` contains the element 26

### Loop Condition:
- The loop runs for `j` in `range(2)`, meaning it will run twice (for `j = 0` and `j = 1`).

### Loop Body Analysis:
- We don't know the exact loop body, but we can infer the possible changes based on the postconditions given.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **First Iteration (`j = 0`):**
   - `j` is incremented from 0 to 1.
   - Since `j` is now 1, we move to the next iteration.

2. **Second Iteration (`j = 1`):**
   - `j` is incremented from 1 to 2.
   - Since `j` is now 2, the loop condition `j < 2` fails, and the loop terminates.

### States to Adjust:
- The only variable in the loop head is `j`.
- The loop will not execute again because `j` is now 2, which does not satisfy the condition `j < 2`.

### Final State:
- `j` is 2 (since the loop has terminated).
- `lex` remains adjusted based on its initial value (no further change since the loop body is not specified).
- `arr` still contains the element 26 (no further change since the loop body is not specified).

### Conclusion:
State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value, and `arr` contains the element 26.**
