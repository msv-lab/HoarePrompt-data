Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `b` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The initial state includes that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, and `b` is a variable that is decremented by 1. The other variables (`p` and `a`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
