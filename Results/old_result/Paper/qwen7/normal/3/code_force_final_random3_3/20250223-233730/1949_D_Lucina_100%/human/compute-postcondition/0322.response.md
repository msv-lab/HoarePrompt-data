Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `nx` is 'S', and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'**.

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the end of the string `nx`. Initially, `nx` is an empty string, so after executing this line, `nx` becomes 'S'. All other variables (`i`, `j`, `n`, and `xx[i][j - 1]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
