Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\). This means `t` can take any integer value between 1 and 50, inclusive.
- `i` is explicitly given as 5.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i, i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly given as 5, the print statement will output the value of `i` twice.

Output: **5 5**
