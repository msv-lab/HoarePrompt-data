Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, `flag` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the original conditions along with the indication that the loop or conditional block has been exited.
