Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` where each element is updated to the maximum value it can take based on the conditions specified in the loop body, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the `cards` list also remains unchanged; `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][j]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to `dp[i + 1][j]`. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is `n-1`, the value of `dp[0][j]` is now set to `dp[1][j]`. All other variables and the structure of `dp` remain unchanged.
