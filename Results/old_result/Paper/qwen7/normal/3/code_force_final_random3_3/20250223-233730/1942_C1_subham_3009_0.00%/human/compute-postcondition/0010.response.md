Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the input split, `x` is the integer value of the second element of the input split, `y` is the integer value of the third element of the input split, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from converting the first `x` elements of the original list of strings.**

Explanation: The code `[n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into three parts, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. The initial state of `t`, `arr`, `n`, `x`, and `y` is updated according to the new values derived from the input. The precondition that `t` is greater than 1 and `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the first `x` elements of the original list of strings remains unchanged.
