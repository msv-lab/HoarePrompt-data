Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n + 1`, where `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is 0.
- `b` is `p[b] - 2`.
- `s` is `p[s] - 2`.
- `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp + a[s]`.
- `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`.
- `bp` is `bp + 2 * a[b]`.
- `sp` is `sp + 2 * a[s]`.

The condition `bm > sm` holds true.

The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Bodya'`. Since no variables are being referenced in this print statement, it will print the string as is.

Output: **'Bodya'**
