Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers inputted separated by spaces; `A` is equal to `int(m / a) + 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `int(m / a) + 1` to the variable `A`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
