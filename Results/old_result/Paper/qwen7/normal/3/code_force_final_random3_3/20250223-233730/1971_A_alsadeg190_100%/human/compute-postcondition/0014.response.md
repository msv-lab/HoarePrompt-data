Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(x)`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `y` is an integer from the split input.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - The loop condition is `i < x`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - Therefore, `x` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
   - `x` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `y` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.

Based on this analysis, the updated states at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer from the split input**.
