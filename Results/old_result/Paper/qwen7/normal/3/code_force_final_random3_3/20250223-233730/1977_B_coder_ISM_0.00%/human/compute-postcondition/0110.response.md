Output State: **`i` is 3, `length` is at least 29, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[0]` is '-1', `s[1]` is '1', `s[2] is '0', for all `i` from 3 to 28, `s[i]` is '0', `s[29]` is '1', `s[30]` is '1', `t` is increased by 1, `x` is an input integer.**

The code `x = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
