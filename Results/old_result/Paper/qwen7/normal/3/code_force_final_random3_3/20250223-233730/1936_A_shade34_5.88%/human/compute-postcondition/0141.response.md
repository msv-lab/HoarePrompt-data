Output State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `mak` is `i`, `n` must be greater than `k`, `pans` is a list containing `[i]`, `s` is a string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `pans` with the value of `i`. Since `i` is `k + 2`, the list `pans` contains the single element `[k + 2]`. The other variables (`mak`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
