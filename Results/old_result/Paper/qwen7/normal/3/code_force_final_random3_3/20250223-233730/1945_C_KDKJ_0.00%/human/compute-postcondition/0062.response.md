Postcondition: `i` is 2, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1] + S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1] + S[1][0] + S[1][1] + S[2][0] + S[2][1])`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, and the value of `ans` is 2 if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`.
