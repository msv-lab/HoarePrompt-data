Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and we read `n` integers from input which are stored in a list but not yet defined.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is not defined yet but will be read subsequently.
