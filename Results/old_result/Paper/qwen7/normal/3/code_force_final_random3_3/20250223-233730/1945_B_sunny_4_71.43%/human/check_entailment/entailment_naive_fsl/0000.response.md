Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. Specifically, the logic for calculating `A` and `B` assumes that the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is simply the sum of the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period. However, this approach does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations.

For example, consider the input `(a=6, b=7, m=4)`. According to the problem description, the first installation launches fireworks at times `[6, 12, 18, 24, ...]` and the second installation at times `[7, 14, 21, 28, ...]`. Within the first 4 minutes, the only time a firework is launched by either installation is at `t=6` (from the first installation) and `t=7` (from the second installation). Therefore, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2, which matches the expected output.

However, the program incorrectly calculates `A` and `B` as follows:
- `A = int(m / a) + 1 = int(4 / 6) + 1 = 1`
- `B = int(m / b) + 1 = int(4 / 7) + 1 = 1`

This results in `A + B = 2`, which is correct for this specific example, but the program does not handle the general case correctly. For instance, if `m` is larger, such as `m=10`, the correct answer would be 2, but the program would still output 2, which is incorrect because the first installation could launch fireworks at `t=6` and `t=12`, and the second installation at `t=7` and `t=14`, resulting in a maximum of 2 fireworks visible at `t=7`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
