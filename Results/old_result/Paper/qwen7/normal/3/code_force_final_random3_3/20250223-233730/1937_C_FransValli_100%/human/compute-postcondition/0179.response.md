Output State: **`arr` is `[0]`, `maxi` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `res` is an input string, `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'` if the loop executes `n-1` times.**

Explanation: The code initializes `arr` as a list containing a single element `0`. None of the other variables (`maxi`, `i`, `res`, `mini`) are modified by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state. The condition for updating `mini` remains the same, pending the execution of the loop which is not provided here.
