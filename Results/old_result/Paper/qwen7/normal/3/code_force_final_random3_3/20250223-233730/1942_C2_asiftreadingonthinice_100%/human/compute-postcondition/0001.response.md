State: **`tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains two variables: `ii` and `tt`.
2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution**: The `for` loop will execute as long as `ii` is less than `tt`. Therefore, the loop can start if `tt` is greater than 0.
3. **Initial Value of `ii`**: The variable `ii` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute, `tt` must be greater than 0, and `ii` should start at 0.
