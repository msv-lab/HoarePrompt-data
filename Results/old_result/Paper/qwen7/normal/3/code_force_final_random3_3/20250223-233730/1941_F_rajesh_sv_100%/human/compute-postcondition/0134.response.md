Output State: `l` is equal to `h`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2` if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, otherwise `h` is equal to `mid`, and `ans` holds the smallest value it has been updated to throughout the process.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the conditions inside the while loop (`l < h`) will no longer hold true, meaning `l` will eventually become equal to `h`. At this point, `mid` will be recalculated as the midpoint between `l` and `h`, and the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` will be updated accordingly. The variable `ans` will retain the minimum value found during the entire process.
