Output State: **The loop will continue until `i` equals the length of `pans`. At that point, the final state will be: `i` is equal to the length of `pans`, `n` is 0 (since it decreases by 1 each iteration and starts as `len(pans) - 1`), `pans` is a list containing all integers from `0` to `len(pans) - 1`, and `mak` is equal to `i - 1`.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over the indices of the list `pans` starting from 1. Each iteration decreases `n` by 1 and updates `mak` based on the user's input. Since `i` starts at 1 and increases by 1 with each iteration, it will eventually reach the length of `pans`. Once `i` reaches the length of `pans`, the loop terminates. At this point, `n` will be 0 because it starts at `len(pans) - 1` and decreases by 1 with each iteration. `mak` will be set to `i - 1` when the loop exits, as the last update to `mak` occurs right before the loop ends.
