Postcondition: **`t` is 3, `N` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value 0 where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`, the count of `i` in `cnt` is not 1, and `i` is 1.**
