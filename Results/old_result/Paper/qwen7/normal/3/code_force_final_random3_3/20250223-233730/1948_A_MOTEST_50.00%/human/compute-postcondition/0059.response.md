Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the expression `n // 2 - 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: The loop will start with `j = 0` because the `range` function generates numbers starting from 0 up to (but not including) the specified end value.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: For the loop to execute, the end value of `range(n // 2 - 1)` must be at least 1. This means `n // 2 - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0, which simplifies to `n // 2 >= 1` or `n >= 2`.

4. **Check the Given States**:
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is `t - 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer and must be an odd number.
   - `ans` is 'AAA'.
   - `x` is 1.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute, and we know `n` is an odd number, the smallest possible value for `n` is 3.
   - `i` is `t - 1`, and since `t` must be at least 1, `i` must be at least 0.
   - The values of `ans` and `x` do not affect the loop condition and can remain as given.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be at least 3 (since it must be an odd number and at least 2), and `i` must be at least 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is at least 0, `n` must be at least 3 (an odd number), `ans` is 'AAA', `x` is 1**
