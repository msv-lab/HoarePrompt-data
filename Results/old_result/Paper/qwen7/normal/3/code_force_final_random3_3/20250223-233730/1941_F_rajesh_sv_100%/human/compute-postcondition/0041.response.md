Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found across all pairs of adjacent elements in the list `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found (or -inf if no such difference exists), `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred (or None if not applicable), `i` is `n`, `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]` if `max_diff` was updated during the last iteration or does not exist otherwise, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`**.

This means that the variables `left` and `right` have been assigned the values of the elements at indices `index - 1` and `index` from the list `A`, respectively. All other variables retain their previous values or conditions as described in the initial state.
