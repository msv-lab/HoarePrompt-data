Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `N` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers with an additional element -1 appended to it, `s` is 3, `e` is 0, `num` is the value of `nums[3]`, `arr` is a list containing one tuple (3, i, num) if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, and `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `num`. Given that `i` is 3, `num` now holds the value of `nums[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
