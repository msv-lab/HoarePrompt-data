Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
    if m < a and m < b:
        print(2)
    elif m < a and m > b:
        print(2 + m // b)
    elif m < b and m > a:
        print(2 + m // a)
    else:
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and after the execution of the if-else block, `m` is either less than both `a` and `b` (if the if condition is true), or `m` is not less than at least one of `a` or `b` (if the else condition is true).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces. Regardless of whether `m` is less than `a` and greater than `b`, the values of `i`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input split. Regardless of whether `m < a and m < b` is true or false, the values of `i`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
