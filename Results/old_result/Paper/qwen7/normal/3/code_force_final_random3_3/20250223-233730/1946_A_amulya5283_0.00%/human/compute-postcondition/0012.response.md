Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `operations` is 1, `heap` contains its first element which is `smallest + 1`, and `smallest` is the smallest element from `heap[0]`.**

Explanation: The line `operations += 1` increments the value of `operations` by 1. Initially, `operations` was 0, so after executing this line, `operations` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
