Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `ma` is 0, `mi` is the length of the string `s`, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string starting with 'B', `c` is the length of the string `s`, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, and `j` is the last character of `s`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `c` and check if the current character `j` is 'B'. Since the loop breaks as soon as it encounters the first 'B', `c` will eventually reach the length of the string `s`. The value of `mi` will be set to the position (index + 1) of the first 'B' encountered, or the length of the string if no 'B' is found. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
for j in s[::-1]:
    d += 1
    if j == 'B':
        ma = len(s) - d
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ma` is the length of the string `s` - 1, `mi` is the length of the string `s`, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string starting with 'B', `c` is the length of the string `s`, the current value of `j` is 'B', `d` is 1, `l` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `d` is 2, `ma` is the length of the string `s` - 2, `mi` is the length of the string `s`, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string starting with 'B', `c` is the length of the string `s`, the current value of `j` is the second character of the original string `s`, `l` is an empty list, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `d` is 3, `ma` is the length of the string `s` - 3, `mi` is the length of the string `s`, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string starting with 'B', `c` is the length of the string `s`, the current value of `j` is the first character of the original string `s`, and `l` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
