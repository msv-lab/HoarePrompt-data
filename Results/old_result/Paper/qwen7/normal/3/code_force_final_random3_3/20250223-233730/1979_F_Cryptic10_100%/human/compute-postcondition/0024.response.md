Output State: **`vx` has at least 2 elements, `v1` is removed from `vx`, `v2` is the new second last element of `vx`, and `ops` is a list containing two tuples. If `v2` is greater than 0, then the tuples are (`v2`, `v2`) and (`v1`, `v2`). Otherwise, the tuples are (0, 0) and (v1, 0).**

Explanation: The code removes `v1`, which is the second last element of `vx`, from `vx`. After removal, `vx` will have at least 2 elements because it originally had at least 3 elements. The value of `v1` is no longer in `vx`, but `v2` remains as the new second last element of `vx`. The list `ops` remains unchanged unless `v2` is greater than 0, in which case its contents are updated accordingly.
