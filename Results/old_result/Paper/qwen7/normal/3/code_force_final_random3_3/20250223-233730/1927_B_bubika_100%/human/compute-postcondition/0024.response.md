Output State: **`r` is an empty string, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input, `t` is `t + 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `r = ''` initializes an empty string `r`. This operation does not affect the values of `b`, `n`, `s`, or `t`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, except for `t` which is incremented by 1 due to the initial state description.
