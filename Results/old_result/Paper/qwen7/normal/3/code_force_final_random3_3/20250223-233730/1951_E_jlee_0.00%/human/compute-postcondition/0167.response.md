Output State: **`done` is `True`, `i` is `0`, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with the first character assigned to `x`, `n` is `1`, `count` is `0`, `count2` is `0`, `j` is `0**.

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there was no loop in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the variables in their initial states.
