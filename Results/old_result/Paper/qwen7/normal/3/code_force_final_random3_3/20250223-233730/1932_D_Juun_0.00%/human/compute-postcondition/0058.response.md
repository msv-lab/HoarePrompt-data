Postcondition: `suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is a suit and the value is either `None` or a rank; `answers` is a list with one element which is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop(){trump}' if `trumps` is not empty. If `trumps` is empty, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition, i.e., `suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is a suit and the value is either `None` or a rank, and `answers` is an empty list.
