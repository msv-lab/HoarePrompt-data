Postcondition: `no_path` is False, `i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `k` is 5, `a` is a new string input by the user, and `a[k]` is not '>'.

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `a[k] != '>'` is true or false, the variables retain their initial states as described, with `no_path` remaining False, `i` being `i_current + 1`, `n` still being an integer greater than 4, `k` staying at 5, `a` being a new string input by the user, and `a[k]` not being '>'.
