State: **`t` is a positive integer, `N` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers with an additional element `-1` appended to it, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first element of `nums`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `N` must be greater than or equal to 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 in the `range(N + 1)` function.
2. For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range specified by `range(N + 1)`, which means `i` should be less than or equal to `N`.
3. The initial value of `i` is 0, so `N` must be greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute, which involves setting `i` to 0 and ensuring `N` is greater than or equal to 0.
