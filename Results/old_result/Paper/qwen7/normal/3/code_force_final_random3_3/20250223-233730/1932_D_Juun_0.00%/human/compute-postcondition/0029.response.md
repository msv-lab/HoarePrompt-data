Output State: **`rank` is the rank part of the new card, `suit` is the suit part of the new card, `trump` remains the suit part of the next card, `trumps` is the list with the new `rank` appended to it, `suits[suit]` is now equal to the new `rank`, `answers` is a list containing one string which is the sorted concatenation of `rank` and `rank` joined by a space.**

Explanation: The code `rank, suit = card` unpacks the tuple `card` into two variables `rank` and `suit`. This means that the values of `rank` and `suit` are now the rank and suit parts of the new card, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged except for `suits[suit]`, which is now set to the new `rank`. Additionally, since `rank` is now a string, the `answers` list contains a string formed by sorting and concatenating `rank` and `rank` (which is the same), resulting in a string that is just `rank` repeated.
