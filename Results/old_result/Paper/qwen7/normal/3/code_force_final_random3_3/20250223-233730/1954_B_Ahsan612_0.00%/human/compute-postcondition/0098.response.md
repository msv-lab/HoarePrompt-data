Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers obtained from input, `minn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `same`, `num` is set to the last `min(minn, same)` value found, `same` is 1 if no further elements were matched after setting `num` to the last `min(minn, same)` value, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `ar`. The values of `minn`, `num`, and `same` remain unchanged from their previous states, and `n` remains as an input integer.
