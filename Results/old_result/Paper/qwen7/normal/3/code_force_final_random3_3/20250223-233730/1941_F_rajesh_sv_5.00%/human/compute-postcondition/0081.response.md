To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head conditions and see how they can be satisfied.

### Loop Head Conditions
The loop condition is:
```python
while l < h:
```

This means the loop will continue as long as `l` is less than `h`.

### Current States
- `l` is updated to either `mid + 1` or `l + (h - l) // 2`.
- `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.
- `h` is updated to either `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1` or `mid`.
- `f` is the next element in `F`.
- `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`.
- `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.
- `left` and `right` must be chosen such that there is at least one element in `D` between `left - f` and `right - f`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Condition for Loop Continuation**: The loop continues as long as `l < h`.
2. **Adjusting `l` and `h`**: To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `l` is still less than `h` after the updates.

Given the possible updates for `l` and `h`:
- `l` can be updated to `mid + 1` or `l + (h - l) // 2`.
- `h` can be updated to `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1` or `mid`.

For the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `l` remains less than `h` after these updates. Therefore, we need to ensure that:
- `l` does not become equal to or greater than `h`.

### Adjustments Needed
- Since `l` can be updated to `mid + 1` or `l + (h - l) // 2`, and `h` can be updated to `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1` or `mid`, we need to ensure that `l` remains strictly less than `h`.

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states such that `l` remains less than `h`.

**State:**
- `l` must be less than `h`.

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:

State: **`l` must be less than `h`**
