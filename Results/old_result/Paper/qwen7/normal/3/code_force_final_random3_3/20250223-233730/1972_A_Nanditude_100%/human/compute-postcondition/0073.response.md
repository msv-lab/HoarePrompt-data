Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range `[0, n)`.
3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - `j` is a value within the range `[0, n - 1)`.
   - `cnt` is 2 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, and 1 otherwise.
   - `b` is a list of integers obtained from input.

4. **Analyze what happens at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - Since `j` is within the range `[0, n - 1)`, it means `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` remains either 0 or 1 because it toggles based on the condition inside the loop but does not change directly in the loop header.
   - `j` will be `j + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `cnt` remains the same unless the condition inside the loop changes it, but since we are only looking at the loop head, we cannot determine its new value without knowing the exact condition inside the loop.

Given the information, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is a value within the range `[0, n - 1)` (incremented by 1), `cnt` is 2 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, and 1 otherwise.**
