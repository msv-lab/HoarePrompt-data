Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `n` in the expression `for i in range(3, n + 1):`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` must be at least 13.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over values of `i` starting from 3 up to `n` inclusive. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - The value of `n` must remain at least 13 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 4, `n` must be at least 13**
