Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `x + 1`, where `x` can be any value starting from 5 or higher.
- `z` will be the final value obtained after performing the operation `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 1 to `x + 1`.
- `a` is less than `z`.

The `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
