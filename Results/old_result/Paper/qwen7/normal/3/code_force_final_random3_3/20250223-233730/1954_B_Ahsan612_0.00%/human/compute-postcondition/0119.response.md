Output State: **`minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`; `same` remains unchanged; `num` remains unchanged; `i` is increased by 1 and is now less than `len(ar)`**.

Explanation: The line `minn = min(minn, same)` updates `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value (`minn`) and the value of `same`. The other variables (`same`, `num`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain the same as they were before the execution of the code.
