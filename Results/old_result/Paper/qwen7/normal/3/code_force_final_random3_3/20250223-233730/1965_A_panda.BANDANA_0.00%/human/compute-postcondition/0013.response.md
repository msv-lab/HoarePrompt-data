Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(t)` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer
   - `e` is a set containing unique elements from the list `l`
   - `m` is the length of the list `l`
   - The number 1 is either in the list `l` or not in the list `l`

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`. Currently, `i` is 1 and `t` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - `t` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the value of `t` is not modified within the loop body (as per the given information).

5. **Construct the new state**: Based on the above analysis, the new state should reflect the updated values of `i` and `t`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `e` is a set containing unique elements from the list `l`, `m` is the length of the list `l`, and the number 1 is either in the list `l` or not in the list `l`.**
