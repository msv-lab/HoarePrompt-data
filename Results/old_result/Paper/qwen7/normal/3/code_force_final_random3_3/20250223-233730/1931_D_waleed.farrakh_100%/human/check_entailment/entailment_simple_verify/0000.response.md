### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program step-by-step and verify its correctness against the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `results` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `freq` is a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a_i % x, a_i % y)`.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`:
     - Compute `rx` and `ry`:
       - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x`: This ensures that `rx` is always non-negative.
       - `ry = a % y`: This computes the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
     - Check if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`:
       - If it does, add the count of such pairs to `count`.
     - Update the frequency dictionary `freq` for the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.

3. **Return the results**:
   - Append the count of beautiful pairs to `results`.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Read input**:
   - Read the entire input from standard input and split it into lines.
   - Extract the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - Parse `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
     - Append the parsed data as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to `test_cases`.

2. **Process test cases**:
   - Call `func_1` with `test_cases` to get the results.
   - Print the results for each test case.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the flow of the program.
- The frequency calculation and the counting mechanism in `func_1` are consistent with the problem requirements.
- The input reading and processing in `func_2` handle multiple test cases efficiently.

#### Correctness Verification:
1. **Modulo Operations**:
   - The use of `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `rx` is always non-negative, which is necessary for the logic to work correctly.

2. **Pair Counting**:
   - The program correctly counts pairs `(a_i % x, a_i % y)` and uses these counts to determine the number of beautiful pairs.

3. **Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program processes multiple test cases correctly by calling `func_1` for each test case and printing the results.

Given the problem description and the annotated code, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.
