Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces. The current value of `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` equals 1.**

Explanation: The code `answers.append('Draw')` appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `i`, and `clues`) remain unchanged. The condition about `clues[2]` being greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` equaling 1 remains valid as no changes were made to these elements.
