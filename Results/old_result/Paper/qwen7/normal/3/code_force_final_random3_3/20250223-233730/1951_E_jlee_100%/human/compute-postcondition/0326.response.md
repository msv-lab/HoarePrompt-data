Output State: **`j` is count, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is a character, `count` is greater than 0, `done` remains unchanged.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the variables `j`, `n`, `x`, `count`, and `done` remain unchanged from their initial states.
