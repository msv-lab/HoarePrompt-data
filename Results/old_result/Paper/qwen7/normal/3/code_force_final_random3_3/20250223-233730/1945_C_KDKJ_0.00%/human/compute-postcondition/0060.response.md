Output State: **`i` is 2, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1] + S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1] + S[1][0] + S[1][1] + S[2][0] + S[2][1])`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `ans` is 2**

Explanation: The line `ans = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 2) to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `left`, `lsum`, `rsum`, and `right` remain unchanged, while `ans` is now set to 2.
