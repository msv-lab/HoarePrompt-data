Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 0, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` where each element is updated to the maximum value it can take based on the conditions specified in the loop body, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the `cards` list also remains unchanged. If `i` is 0, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `i` is 1, then `dp[1][0]` is updated to the maximum value among `dp[2][0]`, `dp[3][-1] + 1` (if `-1` is a valid index, otherwise it would be out of bounds), and `dp[2][1]` if `cards.count(1) != 0`; otherwise, `dp` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will either be 0 or 1, and `j` will be 0. The `dp` table will have been updated according to the rules specified in the loop body. Specifically, for the last column (`j=0`), `dp[1][0]` will be set to the maximum value among `dp[2][0]`, `dp[3][-1] + 1` (if `-1` is a valid index, otherwise it would be out of bounds), and `dp[2][1]` if there is at least one card with value 1 in the `cards` list. Otherwise, `dp[1][0]` will remain unchanged. The values of `t` and `n` will remain the same, and the `cards` list will not be modified.
