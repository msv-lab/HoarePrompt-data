Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` is the integer entered by the user, and `power` is either 15 or 14.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value entered by the user (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `power`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
