Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - i`, `ans` is unchanged or updated based on the condition, and we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip any remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, their previous values remain unchanged. Therefore, the conditions and values of `n`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, `rsum`, and `ans` stay the same, and the loop continues.
