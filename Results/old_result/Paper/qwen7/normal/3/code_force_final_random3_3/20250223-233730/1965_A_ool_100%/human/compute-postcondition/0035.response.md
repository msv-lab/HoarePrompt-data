Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr`, representing the initial number of stones in each pile. It first removes duplicate values from `arr` and sorts the resulting list in ascending order. If the smallest value in the sorted list is not 1, it returns 'Alice'. Otherwise, it checks if the difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list exceeds 1. If such a difference is found, it sets a flag `not_c` to `False` and exits the loop. The function then alternates the value of `A` based on the loop's execution. Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is true, otherwise it returns 'Bob'. In all cases, the function returns 'Alice'.**
