Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values for \( k \) such that Vasya's position and the number he received during the settling match the given conditions.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions. Therefore, the position \( n \) modulo \( 2k - 2 \) should give us the number Vasya received, which is \( x \).

3. **Reformulating the Problem**: Given \( n \) and \( x \), we need to find all possible \( k \) such that:
   \[
   x \equiv n \pmod{2k - 2}
   \]
   This can be rewritten as:
   \[
   2k - 2 \mid (n - x)
   \]
   Or equivalently:
   \[
   2k - 2 \mid (n - x + 2k - 2)
   \]
   Simplifying further:
   \[
   2k - 2 \mid (n + x - 2)
   \]

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**: 
   - The function `func_1` aims to find all divisors of \( \frac{n + x - 2}{2} \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - It correctly identifies potential values of \( k \) by finding divisors of \( \frac{n + x - 2}{2} \) and ensuring they meet the condition.

5. **Main Logic in the Program**:
   - The main logic correctly calculates \( y = n + x \).
   - It checks if \( y \) is even, and if not, prints 0 immediately.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with \( \frac{y - 2}{2} \) and \( x \), and processes the results.

6. **Set Conversion**:
   - Converting the result of `func_1` to a set ensures uniqueness of the divisors, which is necessary since the same divisor might appear multiple times due to the nature of the divisors being checked.

7. **Output**:
   - The length of the resulting set gives the number of valid \( k \) values.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
