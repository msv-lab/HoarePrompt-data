Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in tmp`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `tmp`.

2. **Understand the postconditions from the previous iteration**:
   - `tmp` must not be empty.
   - `y` is decreased by `i-1`.
   - `ans` is increased by `i` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i-1`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - Since `tmp` is used as the iterable in the loop, it must not be empty for the loop to execute again.
   - The variable `i` will take the first element from `tmp` in the next iteration.
   - The conditions involving `y` and `ans` are not directly adjusted in the loop head but are part of the loop body. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted here.

4. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `tmp` must not be empty (this condition is already met as per the problem statement).
   - `i` will be the first element from `tmp` in the next iteration.
   - No changes are needed for `y` and `ans` since they are not part of the loop head.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`tmp` must not be empty, `i` is the first element from `tmp`**
