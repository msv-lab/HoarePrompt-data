Output State: **`j` is 2; `n` is an odd integer greater than 5; `ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`; `x` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `x` is incremented by 1, but the specific value of `x` before the increment is not provided. The other variables (`j`, `n`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
