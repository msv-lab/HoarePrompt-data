Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of `s`, `m` is the minute part of `s`, `h1` is '12', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'PM', and `h` is equal to '12'.**

The code simply assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
