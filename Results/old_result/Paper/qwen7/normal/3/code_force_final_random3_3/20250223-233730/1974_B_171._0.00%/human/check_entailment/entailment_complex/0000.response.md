Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the encoded string by reversing the encoding process.
2. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly decode the string. Instead of decoding, it creates a string containing all lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z' exactly once, followed by an additional 'z'.
3. The logic inside the function is flawed because it does not properly reverse the encoding process. Specifically, it tries to map characters from the `encoded` string to the next available character in the alphabet, but it does not maintain the correct mapping as per the problem statement.
4. The function should create a mapping of characters from the `encoded` string to the corresponding characters in the `r` string (which consists of all distinct letters of the `encoded` string in alphabetical order).
5. Then, it should use this mapping to decode the `encoded` string back to the original string `s`.

Given these points, the provided function does not correctly implement the decoding process as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
