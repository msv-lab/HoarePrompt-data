Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

# Annotated Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `x` will be 1 (since `a[i]` will always be greater than 1 for `i >= 2`), and `b[n]` will be `b[n-1] + 1`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be the same as the value of `n`, `x` will always be 1 because `a[i]` starts from the second element of the list `a` which is guaranteed to be greater than 1, and `b[n]` will be the sum of all `x` values, which is essentially `n`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: [accumulated sum of the original list a]
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `q` will be equal to 0, `x` and `y` will be the last integers entered by the user for each iteration, and the program will print either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of positive integers and a set of queries. For each query, it compares the sum of elements in a specified subarray with a calculated value and prints 'YES' if the sum of elements is less than or equal to the calculated value, or 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.
