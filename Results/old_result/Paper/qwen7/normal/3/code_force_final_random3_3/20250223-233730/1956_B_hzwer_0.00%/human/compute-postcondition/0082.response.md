Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is `n-2`; `dp[i][j]` is the maximum value between `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; the `cards` list remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. Since `i` is either 0 or 1 and `j` is `n-2`, the updated value of `dp[i][j]` depends on the values of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the `cards` list remain unchanged.
