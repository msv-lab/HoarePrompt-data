Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each including an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), a trump suit ("CDHS"), and a list of 2n unique cards. It identifies cards that match the trump suit and forms valid pairs of cards from the same non-trump suit. The function then prints the results, which include the ranks of cards that matched the trump suit, valid pairs of cards from the same non-trump suit, and prints "IMPOSSIBLE" if no valid pairs can be formed. The function does not return any value.**
