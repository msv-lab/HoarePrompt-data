Output State: **`left` is 2 and `right` must be greater than or equal to 1; if `left` equals `right`, then `new_arr` contains the element `arr[1]`; otherwise, `new_arr` contains the elements `arr[right]` and `arr[left]`.**

Explanation: The code `left += 1` increments the value of `left` by 1. Initially, `left` is 1, so after executing the code, `left` becomes 2. The conditions and values of `right`, `new_arr`, and `arr` remain unchanged from the initial state.
