Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `l-1`
- `l` is greater than 0
- `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`
- `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`

The expression `x - y` calculates the difference between the maximum value (`x`) and the minimum value (`y`) in the list `nums`.

Since the exact values of `nums` are not provided, we can only describe the result in terms of the variables `x` and `y`.

Output: **x - y (where x is the maximum value in the list nums and y is the minimum value in the list nums)**
