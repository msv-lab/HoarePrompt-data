Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
   - `k` is either 0 or \(a + (b + c) // 3 + 1\).
   - \((b + c) \% 3\) is not 0.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 1 for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `total` is not mentioned in the loop head, so its state remains unchanged.
   - `i` changes from 0 to 1.
   - `n` remains the same as it was greater than 0 initially and no modification is specified in the loop.

Given these points, the updated states at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `k` is either 0 or \(a + (b + c) // 3 + 1\), and \((b + c) \% 3\) is not 0.**
