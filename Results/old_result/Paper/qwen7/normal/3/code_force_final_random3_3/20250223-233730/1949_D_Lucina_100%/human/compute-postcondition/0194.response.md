Output State: **`nx` is now the string formed by concatenating the character at position `i` in `xx` with the character at position `j-1` in `xx`, `i` is 1, `j` is between 1 and n inclusive.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at position `j-1` in `xx` to the string `nx`. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is between 1 and `n` inclusive, the value of `i` remains unchanged. The character at position `i` and `j-1` in `xx` is not '?', so no condition is checked for that. Therefore, `nx` is updated to include the specified character.
