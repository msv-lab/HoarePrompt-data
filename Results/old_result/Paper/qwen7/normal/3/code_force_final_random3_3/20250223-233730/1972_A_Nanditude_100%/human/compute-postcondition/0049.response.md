Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` is the same, `cnt` remains either 0 or 1, `a` and `b` are lists of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is set to 1 if `b[j] < a[i]` or to 2 otherwise. After executing `i += 1`, if `i` was initially 1, it becomes 2. If `i` was already 2, it becomes 3. However, since the problem does not specify the initial value of `i` being 1 or 2, we consider both cases. The values of `j`, `n`, `cnt`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
