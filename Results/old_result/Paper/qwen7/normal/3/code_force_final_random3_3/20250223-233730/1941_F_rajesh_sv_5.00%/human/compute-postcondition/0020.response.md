Output State: **`max_diff` is equal to `diff`, `next_max_diff` is `-inf` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise it is updated to `diff` if `diff > next_max_diff`, `index` is `i` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise it remains `None`.**

Explanation:
- The line `max_diff = diff` updates `max_diff` to be equal to `diff`.
- The values of `next_max_diff` and `index` remain unchanged because they are only updated under certain conditions (when `diff > max_diff`), and these conditions are not met here.
- All other variables (`i`, `A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`) retain their original values from `func_4()`.
