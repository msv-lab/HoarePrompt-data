### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).
   - This means we want to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements.
   - It then calls a function `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty of the array.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function sorts the array `arr`.
   - It creates a new array `new_arr` where the smallest and largest elements are alternated to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.
   - Finally, it calculates the beauty of the new array by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array is a good start, but simply sorting the array does not necessarily ensure that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
   - **Alternating Smallest and Largest Elements**: The logic in the `while` loop is flawed. The current implementation alternates between the largest and smallest remaining elements, which does not always yield the maximum beauty. For example, consider the array `[1, 10, 100]`. Sorting it gives `[1, 10, 100]`. The proposed algorithm would create `[1, 100, 10]`, but the optimal arrangement would be `[1, 10, 100]` itself, which yields a beauty of 99 (10 - 1 + 100 - 10 = 99).

5. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - To maximize the beauty, we should place the smallest element at one end and the largest element at the other end, ensuring that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
   - A better approach would be to sort the array and then pair the smallest and largest elements, ensuring the differences are maximized.

### Corrected Approach:
- Sort the array.
- Pair the smallest and largest elements to form the new array.
- Calculate the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

### Annotated Code Re-evaluation:
```python
def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
    return max_beauty
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment incorrectly assumed that alternating the smallest and largest elements would always yield the maximum beauty. However, the optimal strategy is to pair the smallest and largest elements directly. Therefore, the original implementation is incorrect.

**Final: False**
