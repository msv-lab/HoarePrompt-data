Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `p[b]` is decreased by 1, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp + a[s]`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `k` is decreased by 1, and `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `bm` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `a[b] * k + bp`.**

This means that the value of `bm` is now the larger of its original value and the new value calculated as `a[b] * k + bp`. All other variables retain their previous values or follow the given conditions.
