Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `x // i` where `x` is divisible by `i`, and `i` is 1. If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
