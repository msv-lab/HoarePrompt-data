### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the provided function summary step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Given Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
```

1. **Test Case Handling**: The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers \( t \), \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
2. **Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - If \( n \) is odd, the program checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying them individually.
     - If \( 2a < b \), it prints \( a \times n \) (buying all yogurts at the regular price).
     - Otherwise, it prints \( \frac{n}{2} \times b + a \) (buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and the remaining one at the regular price).
3. **Even Number of Yogurts**:
   - If \( n \) is even, the program checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying them individually.
     - If \( 2a < b \), it prints \( a \times n \) (buying all yogurts at the regular price).
     - Otherwise, it prints \( \frac{n}{2} \times b \) (buying all pairs at the promotion price).

#### Corrected Version:
The original assessment suggests that the program fails to handle the case where buying yogurts at the promotion price is more advantageous, especially when \( n \) is odd. The suggested correction is:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((n // 2) * b + max(n % 2, 0) * a)
```
- This version correctly handles the case where buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and the remaining one at the regular price is more advantageous.

#### Verification with Examples:
1. **Example 1**: \( n = 2 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \)
   - Regular price: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \)
   - Promotion price: \( 9 \)
   - Output: \( 9 \) (correct)
2. **Example 2**: \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \)
   - Regular price: \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
   - Promotion price: \( 9 + 5 = 14 \)
   - Output: \( 14 \) (correct)
3. **Example 3**: \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \)
   - Regular price: \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
   - Promotion price: \( 11 + 5 = 16 \)
   - Output: \( 15 \) (correct)
4. **Example 4**: \( n = 4 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \)
   - Regular price: \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \)
   - Promotion price: \( 2 \times 11 = 22 \)
   - Output: \( 20 \) (correct)

The corrected version handles all cases correctly, ensuring that the minimum cost is calculated accurately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program, after the suggested corrections, is now correct and handles all cases as required by the problem description.
