Postcondition: ***`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces. This holds true regardless of the comparison between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` since the else part has the same postcondition as the if part.***
