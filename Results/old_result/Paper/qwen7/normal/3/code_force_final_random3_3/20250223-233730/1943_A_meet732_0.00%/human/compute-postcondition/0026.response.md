Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(1, n + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range from 1 to `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

3. **Determine the next value of `j`**: Since `j` starts at 1 and the loop increments `j` by 1 each time it iterates, the next value of `j` will be 2.

4. **Check the condition for breaking out of the loop**: The postcondition given is that if `cntl[j]` is less than 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, and the condition was checked. Now, `j` will be 2, and we need to ensure that the condition for breaking out of the loop (if `cntl[2]` is less than 2) is considered.

5. **Adjust the state**: We need to update the state to reflect the new value of `j` and the condition for breaking out of the loop.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is 2, and if `cntl[2]` is less than 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
