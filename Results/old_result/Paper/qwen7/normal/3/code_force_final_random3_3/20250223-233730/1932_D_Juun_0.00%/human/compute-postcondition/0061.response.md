Output State: **`suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is a suit and the value is either `None` or a rank; `answers` is a list with one element which is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop(){trump}', `trumps` is a list with one element less than before and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the initial state, the only impact is noted as continuing the loop. The values of `suits`, `answers`, and `trumps` remain unchanged from their initial states.
