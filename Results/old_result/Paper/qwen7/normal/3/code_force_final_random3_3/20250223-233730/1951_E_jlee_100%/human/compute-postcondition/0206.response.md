Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is False, `count` is 1, `count2` is 2, `i` is 1, `t` is 1.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, and the values of the variables `j`, `n`, `done`, `count`, `count2`, `i`, and `t` are not affected by the `continue` statement, these values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
