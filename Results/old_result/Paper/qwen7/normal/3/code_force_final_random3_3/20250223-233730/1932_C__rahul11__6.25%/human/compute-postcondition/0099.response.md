Output State: **`c` is 2; `ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`; `res[c]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`; `k` is `n-1`; `l` and `r` remain unchanged**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res[c]` to `ans % m % MOD`. Given that `res[c]` was already equal to `ans % m % MOD` before the code execution, the value of `res[c]` remains unchanged. The other variables (`c`, `ans`, `k`, `l`, and `r`) also remain unchanged as per the initial state.
