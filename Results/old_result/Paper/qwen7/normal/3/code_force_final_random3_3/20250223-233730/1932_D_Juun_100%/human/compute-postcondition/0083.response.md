Output State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `suits` remains unchanged, and `answers` is an empty list.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `trumps` will be an empty list because the loop continues to pop elements from `trumps` until it is empty. The loop does not modify `suits`, so its value remains unchanged. The variable `answers` will also be an empty list because all valid pairs of ranks for each suit that could be formed have been printed out, and there are no more pairs left to form.
