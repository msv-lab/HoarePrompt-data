Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of multiple test cases. Each test case includes three integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It returns a result for each test case based on the given conditions.**

This means the function reads input data which includes multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of x distinct integers. The function then processes this data according to the specified conditions and returns a result for each test case.
