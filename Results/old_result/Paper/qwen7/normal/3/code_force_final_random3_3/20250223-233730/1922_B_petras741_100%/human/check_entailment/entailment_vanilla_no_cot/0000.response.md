Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Triangle Inequality Check**: The solution does not check if the selected three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle. According to the triangle inequality theorem, for three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. This check is missing in the current implementation.

2. **Counting Valid Triangles**: The solution calculates combinations of choosing 3 sticks without considering the triangle inequality condition. For example, if the lengths of the sticks are \(2^1, 2^2, 2^3\), the combination \((2^1, 2^2, 2^3)\) should not be counted because \(2^1 + 2^2 \not> 2^3\).

3. **Incorrect Calculation for Single Lengths**: When there is only one unique length, the solution incorrectly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks. It should return 0 because it's impossible to form a triangle with just one unique length.

To fix these issues, we need to implement the following steps:

1. **Check Triangle Inequality**: Ensure that the three selected sticks satisfy the triangle inequality.
2. **Count Valid Combinations**: Count only those combinations that satisfy the triangle inequality.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    buffer = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
        
        # Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each length
        stick_count = {}
        for length in w:
            if length in stick_count:
                stick_count[length] += 1
            else:
                stick_count[length] = 1
        
        # Find unique stick lengths
        unique_lengths = list(stick_count.keys())
        
        # Initialize result
        res = 0
        
        # Iterate through all unique lengths
        for i in range(len(unique_lengths)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(unique_lengths)):
                for k in range(j + 1, len(unique_lengths)):
                    a, b, c = unique_lengths[i], unique_lengths[j], unique_lengths[k]
                    if a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a:
                        # Calculate the number of ways to pick 3 sticks of lengths a, b, c
                        res += stick_count[a] * stick_count[b] * stick_count[c]
        
        print(res)

func()
```

This corrected function ensures that only valid triangles are counted by checking the triangle inequality condition before counting the combinations.
