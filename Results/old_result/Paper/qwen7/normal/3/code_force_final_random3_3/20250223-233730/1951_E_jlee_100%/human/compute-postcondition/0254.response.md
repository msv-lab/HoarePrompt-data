Postcondition: `j` is assigned the value of `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is a character, `count` is greater than 0, the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`, the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is either equal to `count` (if `count > 1`) or 0 (if `count <= 1`). Additionally, `done` is set to `True` if `count > 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
