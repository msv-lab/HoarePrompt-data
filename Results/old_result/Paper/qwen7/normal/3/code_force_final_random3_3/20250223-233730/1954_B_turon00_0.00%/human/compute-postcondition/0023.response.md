Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `i` is initially 1 and does not change, and `n` must be greater than 1 (which is not affected by the code), the only change is that `cnt` is incremented by 1.
