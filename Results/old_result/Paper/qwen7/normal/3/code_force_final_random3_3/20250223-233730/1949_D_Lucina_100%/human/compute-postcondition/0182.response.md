Output State: **`nx` is a string that is the previous value of `nx` plus the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`; `j` is incremented by 1; `n` must be between 2 and 24; `xx[i][j]` is either not '?' or equals '?'; if `xx[i][j]` is not '?', `nx` is equal to the previous value of `nx` plus the value of `xx[i][j]`; if `xx[i][j]` is '?', then `nx` remains a string; if `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` ends with 'F'; otherwise, `nx` ends with 'S'**.

This means that the value of `nx` has been updated by appending the character from `xx[i][j - 1]` to its end. The value of `j` has been incremented by 1. The conditions for `nx` ending with 'F' or 'S' remain unchanged. The value of `n` and the condition for `xx[i][j]` also remain the same.
