Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 4 (since the loop runs in steps of 2 up to `n-1`), `k` is `n-1` (the last index the loop would check), `a` is a new string input by the user, `b` is the new input string, and `no_path` remains `False` unless `b[k]` is not `'> '` for any `k` in the range of the loop.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will have incremented by 1 from its initial state, `n` will be an odd integer greater than 4, `k` will be set to `n-1` (the highest index the loop processed), `a` and `b` will retain their input values, and `no_path` will remain `False` unless there was at least one character in `b` at an even index less than `n` that was not `'>'`.
