Output State: **`i` is 2, `ans` is 2, `len(a)` is at least 1, and `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is either equal to 2 or not equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` is 1 (based on the condition given), so after executing this line, `ans` becomes 2. The other variables (`i`, `len(a)`, and the condition on `a[i] - a[i - 1]`) remain unchanged.
