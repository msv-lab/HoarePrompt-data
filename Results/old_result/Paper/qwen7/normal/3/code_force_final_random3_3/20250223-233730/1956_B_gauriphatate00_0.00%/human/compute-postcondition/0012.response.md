Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`. The loop variable here is an underscore `_`, which means it's not being used within the loop body. However, the loop itself depends on the variable `t`, which represents the number of iterations.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `data` is unchanged.
   - `idx` is `idx + n + 1`.
   - `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx-n-1:idx-1]`.
   - `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a)`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop variable `_` is not used, the only relevant variable for the loop condition is `t`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 (since `range(t)` will run from 0 to `t-1`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `data` remains unchanged.
   - `idx` is updated to `idx + n + 1`.
   - `a` is updated based on the new value of `idx`.
   - `results` is updated to include one additional element.

Given these points, let's summarize the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `idx` is updated to `idx + n + 1`.
- `a` is updated to `data[idx-n-1:idx-1]`.
- `results` is updated to include one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a)`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + n + 1`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx-n-1:idx-1]`, `results` is a list with two additional elements which are the return values of `func_1(n, a)` for the current and previous iterations**.
