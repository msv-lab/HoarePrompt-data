Output State: **`results` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `count` values computed over all iterations of the loop. The variable `freq` retains its final state from the last iteration, while `rx`, `ry`, `count`, and `current_pair` also reflect their final values from the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `results` list will contain the total sum of all `count` values calculated during each iteration. The `freq` dictionary will hold the final counts of all unique pairs `(a % x, a % y)` encountered throughout the loop. Additionally, the variables `rx`, `ry`, `count`, and `current_pair` will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
