Based on the initial state provided:

- `tab` must contain at least one element, and this element is the string representation of `number`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

Here, `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since no specific value for `i` is provided, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `i` is used as an index to access an element in `tab`.

Given that `tab` contains at least one element, and assuming `i` refers to the index of the first element (which is 0), the print statement will output the first element of `tab` followed by a space.

Output: **number**
