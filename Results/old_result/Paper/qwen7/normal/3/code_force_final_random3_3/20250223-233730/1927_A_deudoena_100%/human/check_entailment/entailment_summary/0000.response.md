Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates the distance from the start (`mi`) and the end (`ma`) of the string to the first occurrence of 'B'. However, it incorrectly adds 2 to the result of `ma - mi`. This does not account for the fact that the segment must cover all black cells, and the minimum segment should start from the first 'B' and end at the last 'B'.

2. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the input `"WBBWBW"`, the expected output is 4, but the program outputs 4 - 1 + 2 = 5, which is incorrect.
   - For the input `"BBW"`, the expected output is 2, but the program outputs 3 - 1 + 2 = 4, which is incorrect.

3. **Function `func_1` Implementation**:
   - The program should find the indices of the first and last 'B' in the string.
   - The minimum segment length should be `last_index - first_index + 1`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the minimum segment length needed to turn all cells white.

Correctness: **False**
