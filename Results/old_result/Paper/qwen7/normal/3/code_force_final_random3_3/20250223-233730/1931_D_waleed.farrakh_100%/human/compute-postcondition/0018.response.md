Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is unchanged, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` on spaces and converting each substring to an integer, `test_cases` is a list containing a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`**.

The code appends a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the list `test_cases`. The values of `data`, `idx`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states. After executing the code, `test_cases` now contains this new tuple.
