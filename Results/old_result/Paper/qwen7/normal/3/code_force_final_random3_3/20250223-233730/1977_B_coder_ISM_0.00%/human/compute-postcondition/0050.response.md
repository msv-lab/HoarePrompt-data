Output State: **`i` is 1, `flag` is 0, `s[0]` is either '0' or '1', `s[1]` is equal to `s[0]`, and `s[1]` is '1'.**

Explanation: The code sets `flag` to 0. The values of `i`, `s[0]`, `s[1]`, and `flag` are updated as follows:
- Initially, `flag` was either 0 or 1, but now it is explicitly set to 0.
- The values of `i`, `s[0]`, and `s[1]` remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `i` is 1, `s[0]` is either '0' or '1', and `s[1]` is equal to `s[0]` and is also '1'.
