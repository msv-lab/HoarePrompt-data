The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing half the number of cards, and `a`, a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and n, inclusive, and appears at most twice. It counts how many numbers in the list `a` appear exactly twice, then returns the smaller value between this count and `n // 2`.
