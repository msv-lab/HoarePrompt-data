Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `d` will be a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `palka` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`. The list `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.**

This means that for each element `i` in `palka`, the dictionary `d` will store how many times `i` appears in `palka`, and the list `pl` will include each unique element from `palka` exactly once, in the order they were first encountered.
