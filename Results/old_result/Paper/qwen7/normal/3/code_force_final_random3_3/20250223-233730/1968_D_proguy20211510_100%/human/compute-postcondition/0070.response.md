Output State: **`i` is 4, `preb` is `preb + pathb[0] + pathb[1]`, `k` is less than 5, `curr` is `preb + pathb[0] * (k - i) + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code snippet, the only effect is that we break out of the implied context. The values of the variables `i`, `preb`, `k`, and `curr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
