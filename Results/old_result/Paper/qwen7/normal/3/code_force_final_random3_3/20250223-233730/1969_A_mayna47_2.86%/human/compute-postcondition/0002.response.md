Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `p` is a list of n integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ n, `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0, `v` is updated to include the first element as 0 and the next n elements as integers inputted from the user.**

Explanation: The code updates the list `v` to include the first element as 0 and the next n elements as integers inputted from the user using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged.
