Output State: `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice' and must have at least three elements.

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `answers` will still be a list containing strings 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice'. The list must have at least as many elements as there were iterations of the loop, which is three in this case. The loop simply prints each element of the `answers` list one by one, so the content of `answers` remains unchanged; it just needs to have at least three elements for the loop to run fully.
