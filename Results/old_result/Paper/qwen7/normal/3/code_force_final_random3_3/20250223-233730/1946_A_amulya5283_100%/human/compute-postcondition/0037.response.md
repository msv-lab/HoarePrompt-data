Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i`, `mdx`, and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `mdx` to `n`.

3. **Analyze the Given States**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`: This condition seems redundant and might be a typo or irrelevant for the loop execution. We can ignore it.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `res` is 0.
   - `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.

4. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments**:
   - `i` should be initialized to `mdx` and will increment until it reaches `n`.
   - `mdx` is already defined as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, so no adjustment is needed for `mdx`.
   - `n` must be such that the loop can run, meaning `mdx` must be less than `n`.

Given these points, the necessary adjustments are:

- `i` should be initialized to `mdx`.
- `n` must be greater than `mdx`.

Since `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `n` must be greater than `mdx` for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is `mdx`, `n` must be greater than `mdx`**.
