Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.** 

This means that after the if-else block executes, `test_cases` remains greater than 0, `answers` remains a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Alice', `i` is set to 2, and `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces. The specific condition checked in the if statement (whether `clues[3] > clues[5]`) determines which part of the if-else block is executed, but in both cases, the specified conditions for `test_cases`, `answers`, `i`, and `clues` are maintained.
