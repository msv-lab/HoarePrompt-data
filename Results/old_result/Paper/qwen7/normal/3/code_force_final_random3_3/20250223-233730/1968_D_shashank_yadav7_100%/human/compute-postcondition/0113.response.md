Postcondition: `k` is an integer, `b` is `p[b] - n`, `s` is `p[s] - n`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] + sp + n * a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp + n * a[b]`, `i` is `n`, and either `bm` is less than `sm` or `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.
