Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `result` from the `results` list.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the `results` list.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `data` remains unchanged.
   - `idx` is `idx + 3 * n`.
   - `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx - 6 * n:idx - 5 * n]` converted using `map(int, ...)`.
   - `results` is a list with `t` elements.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `results`, the only thing that changes is the current `result` being processed.
   - After processing one `result`, the next `result` will be taken from the list.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `data` remains unchanged.
   - `idx` remains unchanged because it is not directly involved in the loop.
   - `a` remains unchanged because it is not directly involved in the loop.
   - `results` will have one less element since one `result` has been processed.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that one element has been removed from `results`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`data` remains unchanged, `idx` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `results` is a list with `t-1` elements**
