Output State: **`shapes` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a non-empty list of integers, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements of `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary where each key `i` from `palka` is associated with the count of how many times `i` appears in `palka`.**

The code initializes the variable `shapes` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
