You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        k = abs(n - m)
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif k % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            f = k - q
            while f & f - 1 != 0:
                l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')
                p = len(l)
                q = 2 ** (p - 1)
                f = f - q
            print(f)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two distinct non-negative integers \(n\) and \(m\). For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference \(k = |n - m|\) and then simplifies \(k\) based on specific conditions. If \(k\) is a power of 2, it remains unchanged. If \(k\) is odd, it also remains unchanged. If \(k\) is even and at least 14, it is reduced to 0 through a series of operations. For even values of \(k\) less than 14, they are similarly reduced to 0. The function outputs the simplified value of \(k\) for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program seems to be attempting to find the highest power of 2 that divides the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. However, this approach does not account for the actual longest common subsegment in the sequences generated by XOR operations.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `x = 57`, `y = 37`

According to the problem description, we need to find the longest common subsegment in the sequences `a_n = n \oplus 57` and `b_n = n \oplus 37`.

The sequences start as follows:
- `a = [57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, ...]`
- `b = [37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, ...]`

Performing the XOR operations, we get:
- `a = [57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, ...] -> [57, 41, 40, 35, 34, 29, 28, ...]`
- `b = [37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, ...] -> [37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, ...]`

By manually checking the sequences, we can see that the longest common subsegment is `[35, 34]` which has a length of 2. However, the program outputs 4, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, and hence the correctness is **False**.
