Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the logic used in the function `func()` generates a k-level permutation for each test case as per the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases (`t`) and then processing each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Permutation Generation**:
   - The program initializes an array `array` with the first `n` natural numbers.
   - It starts with `answer` containing the number `1`.
   - It uses a list `a` initialized as `[1, -1]` to keep track of the indices for accessing elements in `array`.
   - The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1` to build the `answer` list. For each iteration:
     - If `(-1) ** i == -1`, it appends `array[a[-1]]` to `answer` and decrements `a[-1]`.
     - Otherwise, it appends `array[a[0]]` to `answer` and increments `a[0]`.
   - This approach ensures that the indices accessed from `array` are alternately incremented and decremented, leading to a specific pattern in the `answer` list.

3. **k-Level Permutation Check**:
   - The problem requires that the permutation should be k-level, meaning the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length `k` should be at most 1.
   - Given the construction method, the `answer` list is built in a way that the difference between consecutive elements is at most 1. This ensures that the sums of any continuous segments of length `k` will also have a difference of at most 1 because the elements are constructed to maintain this property.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the generated `answer` list for each test case, which is a permutation of the first `n-1` natural numbers.

Given the above points, the program correctly constructs a k-level permutation for each test case based on the given constraints and requirements.

Correctness: **True**
