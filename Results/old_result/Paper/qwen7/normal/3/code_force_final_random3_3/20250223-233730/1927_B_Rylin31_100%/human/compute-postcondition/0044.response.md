Output State: **`ans` is a string where the last character is 'b', `s[j+1]` is `s[j+1] + 1`, `s` retains its original values, `j` is incremented by 1, and `s[j]` is `s[j] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `s[j] += 1` increments the value of `s[j]` by 1. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans` remains a string with the last character being 'b', `s[j+1]` is `s[j+1] + 1`, `s` retains its original values, `j` is incremented by 1, and `s[j]` is now `s[j] + 1`.
