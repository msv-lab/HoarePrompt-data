Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the function `func_1()` which processes each test case according to the problem statement. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of rounds `n`, the trump suit, and the list of 2n cards. This matches the problem description.

2. **Suit and Rank Management**:
   - The function correctly identifies and stores the ranks of cards that match the trump suit in the `trumps` list.
   - It also manages the highest rank for each non-trump suit in the `suits` dictionary.
   - Valid pairs of cards from the same non-trump suit are added to the `answers` list, ensuring the higher rank comes before the lower rank.

3. **Handling Trump Cards**:
   - When a non-trump suit is encountered, the function checks if there are any trump cards available. If so, it forms a valid pair by comparing the highest non-trump rank with the lowest trump rank. Otherwise, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE".

4. **Final Output**:
   - The function correctly outputs all valid pairs of cards from the same non-trump suit.
   - It handles the case where no valid pairs can be formed by printing "IMPOSSIBLE".
   - The function ensures that the `trumps` list is empty at the end, indicating all trump cards have been paired.

Given that the function accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement and the annotated comments, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
