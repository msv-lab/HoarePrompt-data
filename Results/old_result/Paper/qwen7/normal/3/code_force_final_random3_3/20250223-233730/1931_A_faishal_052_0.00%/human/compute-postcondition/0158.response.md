Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, printing 'a' three times.

Explanation: Given the loop iterates 3 times as per the provided states, and each iteration prints the character corresponding to the current value of `arr[k] + 96`, where `arr` starts with the first three elements as 26. Since 26 + 96 equals 122, which corresponds to the character 'z' in ASCII, but considering the pattern and the fact that the loop prints 'chr(arr[k] + 96)', it implies that `arr` might have been intended to contain values that correspond to 'a' ('a' is 97 in ASCII). However, since the initial values are all 26, and no changes are mentioned within the loop, the loop will print 'z' three times. But based on typical patterns in such problems, if the intention was to print 'a', then the initial values of `arr` should have been 1, and the loop would print 'a' three times. Given the problem constraints and the provided states, the output is 'z' three times.
