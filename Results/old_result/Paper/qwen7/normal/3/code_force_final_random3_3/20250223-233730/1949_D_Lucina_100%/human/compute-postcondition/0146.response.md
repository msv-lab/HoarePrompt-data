Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be between 2 and 24; `sa` is a list containing 2.**

The code `sa.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `sa`. Since `i` was initially 2, it remains 2. The condition on `n` (it must be between 2 and 24) is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `sa` which now contains the value 2.
