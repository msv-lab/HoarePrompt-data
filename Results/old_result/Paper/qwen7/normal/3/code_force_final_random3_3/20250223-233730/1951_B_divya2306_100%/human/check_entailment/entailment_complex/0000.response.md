Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of ratings `a`.
3. The program calculates the initial number of wins `wins` without any swaps by counting how many elements in `a` are less than or equal to `a[k-1]`.
4. If `wins` is at least `k`, it prints `wins - 1` and returns, which is correct because no swap is needed.
5. If `wins` is less than `k`, it calculates the potential number of wins `win_with_swap` by considering a swap. This is done by counting how many elements in `a` from index `win_with_swap` to `k-2` are greater than `a[k-1]` and adding 1 to `wins`.
6. Finally, it prints the maximum of `wins - 1` and `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)`.

Given the logic and the provided example, the program appears to follow the correct approach to solve the problem. The state annotations provided in the question also support the correctness of the logic.

Correctness: **True**
