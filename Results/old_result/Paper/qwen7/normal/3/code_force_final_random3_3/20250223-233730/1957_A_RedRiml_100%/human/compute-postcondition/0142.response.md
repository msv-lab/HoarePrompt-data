Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `pl`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: 
   - `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`.
   - `pl` must have at least one element.
   - The current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`.
   - `pl` must have at least one element.
   - The current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is based on `pl` having at least one element and `d[j]` being greater than or equal to 3, we need to ensure these conditions hold true for the next iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `pl` must still have at least one element, and the value of `d[j]` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - `shapes` remains unchanged as it was already updated in the previous iteration.
   - `pl` must still have at least one element.
   - `d[j]` must still be greater than or equal to 3 for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`, `pl` must have at least one element, and the current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3**.
