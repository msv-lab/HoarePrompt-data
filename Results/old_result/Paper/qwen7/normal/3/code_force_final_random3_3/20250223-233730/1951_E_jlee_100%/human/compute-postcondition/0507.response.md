Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is `True`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the values of `j`, `n`, `done`, `count`, and `count2` remain unchanged. The loop continues to execute from the beginning of the next iteration.
