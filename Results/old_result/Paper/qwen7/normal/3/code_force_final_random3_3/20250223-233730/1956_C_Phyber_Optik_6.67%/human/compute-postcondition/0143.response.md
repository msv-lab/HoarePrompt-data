Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `j` is defined as `2 * n + 2`.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `r` must be at least `n + 1`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(*range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to but not including `n + 1`.
   - The `*` operator is used to unpack the range into separate arguments for the `print` function.
   - Since `n` must be at least 1, the smallest possible value for `n` is 1. If `n` were 1, the range would generate numbers from 1 to 2 (i.e., 1, 2).
   - For any valid `n`, the `print` statement will output the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

4. **Output**:
   - Given that `n` must be at least 1, the output will be the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **1 2 ... n (where n is at least 1)**
