Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining if Array is Beautiful:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If the array is uniform, it prints `-1`. However, this logic is incomplete because the problem states that the array is beautiful, meaning it can be made uniform by the specified operations, but we need to find the minimum number of elements to remove to prevent it from being beautiful.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Removals:**
   - The program calculates the minimum number of elements to remove based on the count of consecutive elements that are the same. This approach is flawed because it doesn't account for the specific operations allowed (i.e., replacing \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) when \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\)).

3. **Missing Handling of Operations:**
   - The program does not simulate the operations required to make the array non-beautiful. It simply counts consecutive elements, which is not sufficient.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the operations and track the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty of the array. Hereâ€™s a revised version of the solution:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Track the last position where an element was removed
    last_removed = [-1] * (n + 1)
    
    # Function to check if the array can be made beautiful after removing elements
    def can_be_made_beautiful(start, end):
        for i in range(start + 1, end):
            if arr[i] != arr[start] and arr[i] != arr[end]:
                return False
        return True
    
    # Track the minimum removals needed
    min_removals = float('inf')
    
    # Iterate through the array to find the minimum removals
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] != arr[(i + 1) % n]:  # Check the boundary condition
            continue
        j = i + 1
        while j < n and arr[j] == arr[i]:
            j += 1
        if can_be_made_beautiful(i, j):
            min_removals = min(min_removals, j - i - 1)
    
    if min_removals == float('inf'):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(min_removals)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()
```

This solution iterates through the array and checks for segments where the array can still be made beautiful by removing elements. It uses a helper function to verify if the array can be made beautiful after removing elements from a segment. Finally, it calculates the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty of the array.
