Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

# Annotated Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `a` will be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`, and `b` will be 0.
    #
    #This is because the given loop implements the Euclidean algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers. The loop continues until `b` becomes 0, at which point `a` holds the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`, with `b` being 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
        
    #State: Output State: `cnt` is 6, `i` is 5, `m` must be at least 3, `x` is -21, `y` is 25.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues until `i` exceeds `m`. From the given information, we can see that after 3 iterations, `i` is 4 and `m` must be at least 3. For the loop to complete all its iterations, it needs to run for `m` values from 1 to the final value of `i` which is 4 in this case. Therefore, the loop will run 4 times in total. 
    #
    #- After 1st iteration: `cnt` = 2, `i` = 2, `x` = `n - 1`, `y` = 4
    #- After 2nd iteration: `cnt` = 5, `i` = 3, `x` = `n - 8`, `y` = 9
    #- After 3rd iteration: `cnt` = 8, `i` = 4, `x` = -8, `y` = 16
    #
    #For the 4th iteration:
    #- `i` = 5
    #- `x` = `n - (5 * 5 - 5)` = `n - 20`
    #- `y` = `5 * 5` = 25
    #- `cnt` = `8 + math.ceil((-20) / 25) + ((-20) % 25 == 0)` = `8 + 0 + 0` = 8
    #
    #Thus, after the loop completes all its iterations, `cnt` will be 8, `i` will be 5, `m` must be at least 3, `x` will be `-21` (since `n - 20 - 1`), and `y` will be 25.
    return cnt
    #The program returns 8, with `cnt` being 8, `i` being 5, `m` being at least 3, `x` being -21, and `y` being 25.
