Postcondition: `tmp` now has one fewer element, `i` is either the first element of the original `tmp` or has been removed, `ans` is the sum of its previous value and `i`, `y` is decreased by `i - 1` if `y >= i - 1`. Otherwise, `i` is either the first element of the new `tmp` or has been removed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
