Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `adv`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j < adv`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is `adv - 1 - (a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1)`
   - `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`
   - `ans` contains an additional element `a[i - 1] - j - 1`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from `adv - 1 - (a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1)` in the previous iteration, in the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j + 1` must still be less than `adv`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `j` will be updated to `j + 1`.
   - `adv` remains unchanged since it is determined by the values of `a[i - 1]`, `cnt`, and `cur`, which do not change within the loop.

6. **Final state**:
   - `j` will be `adv - 1 - (a[i - 1] - ((j + 1) + 1) - 1) = adv - 1 - (a[i - 1] - (j + 2) - 1)`.
   - `adv` remains the same.
   - `ans` will contain an additional element `a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`j` is `adv - 1 - (a[i - 1] - (j + 2) - 1)`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `ans` contains an additional element `a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1`**
