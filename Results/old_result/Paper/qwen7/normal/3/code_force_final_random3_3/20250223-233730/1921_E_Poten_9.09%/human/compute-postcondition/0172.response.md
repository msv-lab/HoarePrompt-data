Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The initial value of `i` is 1, so after incrementing (even though the increment operation is not explicitly shown, we can infer it since `i` is typically incremented after appending to a list in similar contexts), `i` becomes 2. All other variables retain their initial conditions except for `answers`, which now includes the string `'Draw'`.
