Output State: **`i` is 1, 2, or 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `s` is a string input by the user, `pans` is a list containing the value of `i` if `s` is '<' or '=', otherwise `pans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. However, this line does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `s`, and `pans` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
