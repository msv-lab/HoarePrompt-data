Postcondition: `i` is either `n-5` or `n-4`, `j` is `0`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros except for `dp[i][j]` which is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1` if `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, otherwise `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the `cards` list remains unchanged.
