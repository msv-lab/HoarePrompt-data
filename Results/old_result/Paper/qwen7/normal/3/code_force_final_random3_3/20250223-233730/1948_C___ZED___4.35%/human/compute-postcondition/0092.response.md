Postcondition: `no_path` is False, `n` must be greater than 1, the next even number after the current value of `k` is assigned to `k`, `a` is a string input by the user, and the current value of `a[k]` is not '>', `b` is a string input by the user. If `a[k]` is not '>', then the next even number after the current value of `k` is assigned to `k`.
