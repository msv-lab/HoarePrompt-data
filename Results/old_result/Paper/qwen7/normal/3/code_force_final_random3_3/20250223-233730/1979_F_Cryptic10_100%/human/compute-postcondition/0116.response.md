Output State: **`vx` has exactly 2 elements remaining, `ops` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed during each iteration, `p1` and `p2` are still empty sets.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `vx` will have exactly 2 elements left because the loop continues as long as `len(vx) > 2`. The variable `ops` will contain a list of tuples that represent all the operations performed during each iteration of the loop. Since the loop removes elements from `vx` and appends tuples to `ops`, eventually, when `vx` has only 2 elements left, the loop will terminate. The sets `p1` and `p2` remain empty as they were not modified within the loop body.
