Postcondition: **`i` is either `n-5` or `n-4`, `j` is `-1`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros (except for `dp[i][j]` which is calculated based on the condition). `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `cards` list remains unchanged.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, `i` will be either `n-5` or `n-4`, depending on whether `cards.count(j + 1)` equals 1 or not. `j` will always be `-1`. The `dp` table will be updated according to the specified rules within the if and else parts, and `t`, `n`, and the `cards` list will remain unchanged.
