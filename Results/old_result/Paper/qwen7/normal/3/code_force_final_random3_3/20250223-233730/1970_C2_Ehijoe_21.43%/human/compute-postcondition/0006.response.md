Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[u]` now contains the value `v`.**

Explanation: The line `nodes[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `nodes[u]`. Since `u` and `v` are input integers, and no other variables are affected, the values of `i`, `n`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged. The only new information is that `nodes[u]` now includes `v`.
