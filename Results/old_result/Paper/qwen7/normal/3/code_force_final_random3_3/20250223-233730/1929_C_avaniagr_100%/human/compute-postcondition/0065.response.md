Postcondition: `k` is `s` split and converted to int and decreased by 2, `x` is the second value of `s` split and converted to int and must be greater than `k - 3`, `a` is the third value of `s` split and converted to int, `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x - k + 3` times, and if `a >= z`, `z` remains unchanged; otherwise, `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x - k + 3` times.
