Postcondition: `a` is the second element of the tuple `inp`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an updated input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `x` is \(n + 1\), `y` is `a`. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` becomes either 1 or 2, and `x` equals `y` is evaluated to False.
