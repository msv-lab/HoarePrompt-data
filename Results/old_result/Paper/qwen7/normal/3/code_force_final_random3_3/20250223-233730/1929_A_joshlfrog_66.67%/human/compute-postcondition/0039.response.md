Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `l`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop `for i in range(l)` will execute as long as `l` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Current States**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `e` is 1.
   - `l` is an input integer.
   - `x` is 0.
   - `y` is 100000000.
   - `nums` is a list of integers created from user input.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop depends on `l`, `l` must be a positive integer and at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The values of `t`, `e`, `x`, `y`, and `nums` do not affect the loop's ability to execute based on the given information.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `l` must be a positive integer and at least 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`l` must be a positive integer and at least 1**
