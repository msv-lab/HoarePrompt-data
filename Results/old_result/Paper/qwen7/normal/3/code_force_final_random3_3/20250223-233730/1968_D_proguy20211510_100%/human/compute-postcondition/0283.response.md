Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer, `preb` is increased by `pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop, `ps` is the final value of `p[ps - 1]` after the loop, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of elements added during the loop execution, `paths` is the list of `k` elements, each being `a[ps - 1]`, `vis[pb - 1]` is marked as visited (set to 1), `resb` is equal to `max(resb, curr)`, and `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`**.

This means that the current value of `curr` is calculated as `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
