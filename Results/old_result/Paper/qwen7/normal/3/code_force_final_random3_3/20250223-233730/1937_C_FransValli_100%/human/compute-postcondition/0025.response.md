Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1 (or any value in the range [1, n-1])
- `n` must be at least 4

We need to determine the values printed by the statement `print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)`.

1. **maxi**: The value of `maxi` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since it's not specified, we cannot determine its exact value. We'll leave it as `maxi`.

2. **arr[0]**: The value of `arr[0]` is also not explicitly defined. We'll leave it as `arr[0]`.

3. **i**: According to the initial state, `i` is 1.

Putting it all together, the print statement will output a string with the placeholders for `maxi` and `arr[0]`, along with the value of `i`.

Output: **'? maxi arr[0] maxi 1'**
