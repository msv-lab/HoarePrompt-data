Output State: **`i` is 29; `flag` remains unchanged; `s` is a list where the 29th element is '1'.**

Explanation: The code `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the end of the list `s`. Initially, the 29th element of `s` was `'0'`. After appending `'1'`, the length of the list increases by one, making the new 29th element `'1'`. The values of `i` and `flag` remain unchanged.
