Based on the initial state provided:

- `suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is a suit and the value is either `None` or a rank.
- `answers` is a list with one element which is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop(){trump}'.
- `trumps` is a list with one element less than before.
- We continue the loop if `rank` is `None`.

The `print('IMPOSSIBLE')` statement directly prints the string `'IMPOSSIBLE'` without any variables or objects from the initial state being used in the output.

Output: **IMPOSSIBLE**
