Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is 1.
- `x` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `y` is an integer from the split input.

The code snippet `print(x, y)` will print the values of `x` and `y`.

Since `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the first and second integers from the input respectively, the output will be those two integers.

Output: **x y (where x and y are the first and second integers from the input respectively)**
