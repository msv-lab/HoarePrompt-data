Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `n` is between 2 and 24
   - `nx` is a string composed of 'F', 'S', and possibly characters from `xx[i][j - 1]` where `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n + 1`, it means the current value of `i` is already the upper bound of the loop. For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to `1` (the lower bound of the loop).
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to `1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop itself.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` is now `1`
   - `n` is still between 2 and 24
   - `nx` remains a string composed of 'F', 'S', and possibly characters from `xx[i][j - 1]` where `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?`

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is between 2 and 24, `nx` is a string composed of 'F', 'S', and possibly characters from `xx[i][j - 1]` where `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**
