Output State: **`x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`, `x` is the next element in `operational_list`, `rev_res` is 0, and `rev_val` contains the reversed string of `x`.**

Explanation: The code `x_rev = int(x[::-1])` reverses the string `x` and converts it to an integer. The value of `x_rev` is updated to this integer value. The other variables (`x`, `rev_res`, and `rev_val`) retain their original states.
