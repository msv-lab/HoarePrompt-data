Based on the initial state provided:

- `tab` must contain at least one element.
- `i` will be set to the first element of `tab`.

The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i`, followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Since `i` is set to the first element of `tab`, and `tab` contains at least one element, `i` will be the value of that first element.

Output: **the first element of tab**
