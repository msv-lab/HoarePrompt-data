### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game played on a tree with \( t = 1 \) rounds. Each round starts with a stone on a specific node, and players take turns moving the stone to an unvisited neighbor. The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The game is played optimally.
   - The winner is determined by the parity of the number of moves available from the starting node.
   - If there is at least one odd-length path from the starting node, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**:
     - This function calculates the path lengths from the start node to all other nodes in the tree, ensuring no path goes through the parent node.
     - It uses recursion to explore all paths and collects the distances.
   - **Function `func_2`**:
     - Reads the input to build the treeâ€™s adjacency list.
     - Identifies leaf nodes (nodes with only one neighbor).
     - Calls `func_1` to get the distances from the starting node.
     - Determines the winner based on whether any distance is odd.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the input and constructs the tree.
   - **Path Length Calculation**: `func_1` correctly computes the path lengths from the start node to all other nodes.
   - **Winner Determination**: The logic to check if any path length is odd and decide the winner is correct.

Given the analysis, the code correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the path lengths from the starting node.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
