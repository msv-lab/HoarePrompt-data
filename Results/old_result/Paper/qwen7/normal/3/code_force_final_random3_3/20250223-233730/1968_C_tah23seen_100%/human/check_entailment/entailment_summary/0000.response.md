Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by defining a function `func_1` that generates the array `a` based on the given array `x`.
2. However, the logic implemented in `func_1` does not correctly follow the problem constraints. Specifically, the formula `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` does not guarantee that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`.
3. The execution summary mentions that the variable `i` is set to `-1`, but this is not relevant to the correctness of the logic used to generate the array `a`.
4. The logic in `func_1` incorrectly assumes that `a_i = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` will satisfy the modulo condition, which is not necessarily true. For example, if `arr = [2, 4, 1]`, the generated `ans` would be `[1000000000, 999999998, 999999997]`, which does not satisfy the modulo conditions.
5. A correct approach would involve ensuring that each `a_i` is chosen such that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}`, which might require a different algorithmic approach.

Given these points, the current implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
