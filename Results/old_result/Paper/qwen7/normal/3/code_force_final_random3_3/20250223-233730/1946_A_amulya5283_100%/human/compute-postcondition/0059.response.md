Output State: **`t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string and converted to integers using map(int, input().split()).**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The list `a` is updated to its sorted version.
