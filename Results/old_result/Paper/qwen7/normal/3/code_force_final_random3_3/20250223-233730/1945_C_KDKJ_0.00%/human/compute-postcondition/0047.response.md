Output State: **`i` is 1, `left` is `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is `S[1][0] + S[1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]` to the variable `right`. Since `i` is 1, `S[i][1]` becomes `S[1][1]`. The other variables (`i`, `left`, `lsum`, `rsum`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `right` is updated to `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]`.
