Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, n is even). For each test case, it reads two strings of length n, each consisting only of '<' and/or '>', and returns a result based on these inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific integers and character strings, without accepting any parameters itself. It processes these inputs to produce an output for each test case.
