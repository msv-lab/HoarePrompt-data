Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers inputted from the user, `k` is either `a + (b + c) // 3` or `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`, depending on whether `(b + c) % 3` equals 0 or not, `b` is an integer not divisible by 3 and `b % 3 + c` is less than 3, or `b` is divisible by 3 or `b` is not divisible by 3 and `b % 3 + c` is greater than or equal to 3.
