Output State: **`i` is 0, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of length `l` containing `[0] * l`, `array` is a list of integers created from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `array = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `array`. The initial values of `i` and `l` remain unchanged, and `s` is still a list of length `l` containing `[0] * l`. The new variable `array` is created and contains the integers from the input.
