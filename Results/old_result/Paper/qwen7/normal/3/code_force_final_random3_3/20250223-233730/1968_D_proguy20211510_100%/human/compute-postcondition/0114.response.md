Output State: **`n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are now integers converted from their respective input values, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, and `i` remain in their previous states, `resb` remains in its previous state.**

The code converts the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` from strings to integers using the `int()` function. The variables `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `i`, and `resb` are not affected by this operation, so they remain in their previous states.
