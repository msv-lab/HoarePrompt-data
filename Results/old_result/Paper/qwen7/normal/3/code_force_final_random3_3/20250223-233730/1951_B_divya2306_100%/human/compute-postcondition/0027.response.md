Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `win_with_swap`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values and Conditions**:
   - `wins` is 4.
   - `i` is 9999.
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
   - The condition `wins < k` holds true.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `win_with_swap` to `k - 1` (exclusive).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The initial value of `i` (9999) is irrelevant since the loop starts with `i = win_with_swap`.
   - We need to ensure that `win_with_swap` is within the range `[1, k-1]` because the loop will run from `win_with_swap` to `k - 1`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can start executing correctly. Specifically, we need to ensure that `win_with_swap` is within the valid range and that `wins < k` still holds true.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`wins` is 4, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `win_with_swap` is between 1 and `k-1`, and `wins < k` holds true**.
