Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `j` is defined as `2 * n + 2`.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `r` must be at least `n + 1`.
   - The condition `j <= n` is false.

2. Given that `j = 2 * n + 2` and `j <= n` is false, we need to determine the value of `n` that satisfies both conditions. Since `j <= n` is false, `2 * n + 2 > n`. This simplifies to `n + 2 > 0`, which is always true for any positive integer `n`. However, since `n` must be at least 1, let's consider the smallest possible value for `n`, which is 1.

3. If `n = 1`:
   - `j = 2 * 1 + 2 = 4`.

4. Now, we need to evaluate `j % n`:
   - `j % n = 4 % 1 = 0`.

5. The code snippet is:
   ```
   print(2, j % n, end=' ')
   ```

6. Substituting the values:
   - `2` is explicitly printed.
   - `j % n = 0` is printed.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2 0**
