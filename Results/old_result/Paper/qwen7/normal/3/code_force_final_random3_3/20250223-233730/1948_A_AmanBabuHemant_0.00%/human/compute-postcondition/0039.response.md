Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n`. For each `n`, it checks if `n` is odd or even. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even and the resulting string `s` (consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times) has a length less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by `s`; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function ultimately ensures that for each test case, it provides a binary outcome ('YES' or 'NO') based on the conditions specified.**
