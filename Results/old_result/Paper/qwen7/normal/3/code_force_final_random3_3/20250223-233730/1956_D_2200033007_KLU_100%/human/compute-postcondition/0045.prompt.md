You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers of length n, where 1 <= n <= 18, and start_index is an integer such that 0 <= start_index <= n - 1. The variable res is a list that will store the operations performed.
def make_stairs(i):
    is_already_stairs = True
    for j in range(i + 1):
        if arr[start_index + j] != j:
            is_already_stairs = False
        
    #State: Output State: `is_already_stairs` remains True, `j` is 2, and `i` is greater than 0. The values of `arr[start_index + 0]`, `arr[start_index + 1]`, and `arr[start_index + 2]` are not equal to 0, 1, and 2 respectively. If any of these conditions are not met (i.e., `arr[start_index + j]` equals `j` for any `j` from 0 to 2), then `is_already_stairs` would have been set to `False`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `is_already_stairs` will still be `True` if none of the elements in the specified range of the array (`arr[start_index + j]` for `j` from 0 to `i`) match their respective indices. Otherwise, it would have been set to `False` at the point where the condition was violated.
    if is_already_stairs :
        return
        #The program does not return anything
    #State: `is_already_stairs` remains True, `j` is 2, and `i` is greater than 0. The values of `arr[start_index + 0]`, `arr[start_index + 1]`, and `arr[start_index + 2]` are not equal to 0, 1, and 2 respectively.
    if (i == 0) :
        res.append((start_index, start_index))
        arr[start_index] = 1
        return
        #The program does not return anything since there is no return statement in the given code snippet.
    #State: Postcondition: `is_already_stairs` remains True, `j` is 2, and `i` is greater than 0. The values of `arr[start_index + 0]`, `arr[start_index + 1]`, and `arr[start_index + 2]` are not equal to 0, 1, and 2 respectively, and `i` is not equal to 0.
    if (arr[start_index + i] == i) :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    else :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
        res.append((start_index, start_index + i))
        for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
            arr[j] = i
            
        #State: Output State: `j` is 2, `i` is 1, `start_index` is 0, `arr[0]` is 1, `arr[1]` is 1, `arr[2]` is 1.
        #
        #Explanation: Given the loop continues as long as `i` is not zero and considering the output state after 3 iterations, it's clear that `i` was decremented from its initial value to 1 over these iterations. The loop sets each element from `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive) to the value of `i`. Since `i` was 1 for the last iteration and remained 1 for subsequent iterations until it reached 0, all elements from `start_index` to `start_index + i` were set to 1. With `start_index` being 0 and `i` being 1 for the final iteration, `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[2]` are all set to 1.
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    #State: `is_already_stairs` remains True, `j` is 2, and `i` is 0. The values of `arr[start_index + 0]`, `arr[start_index + 1]`, and `arr[start_index + 2]` are not equal to 0, 1, and 2 respectively. If `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i - 1`, then `i` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is set to 0, `start_index` is set to 0, and `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[2]` are all set to 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter i, which is an index of a list arr. It does not return anything since there are no return statements in the given code snippet.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return anything

Case_2: The program does not return anything since there is no return statement in the given code snippet.
