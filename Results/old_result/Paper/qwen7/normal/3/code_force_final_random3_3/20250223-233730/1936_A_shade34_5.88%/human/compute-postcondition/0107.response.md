Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is `n-1`, a string input has been read and its value is less than the character '<', and `n` must be greater than `n-1`.**

Explanation: The line `mak2 = mak` assigns the value of `mak` (which is `n-1`) to `mak2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
