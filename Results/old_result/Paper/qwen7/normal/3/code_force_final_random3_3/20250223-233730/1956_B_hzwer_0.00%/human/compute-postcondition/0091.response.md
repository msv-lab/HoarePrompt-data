Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is `n-3`; `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; the `cards` list also remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to the maximum of three expressions involving `dp` values. Since `i` can only be 0 or 1, and `j` is defined as `n-3`, these values remain unchanged. The `cards` list and variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this operation.
