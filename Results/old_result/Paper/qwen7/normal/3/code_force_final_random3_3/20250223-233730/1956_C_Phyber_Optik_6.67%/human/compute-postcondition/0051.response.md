Output State: The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = n + r`. For each iteration, if `j` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints `1 j` followed by a range from `1` to `n`. If `j` is greater than `n`, it prints `2 (j % n)` followed by the same range. After all iterations, `j` will be `n + r + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, and `sum` remains `0` because the problem statement does not indicate any changes to `sum` within the loop body. Therefore, the final values are `j = n + r + 1`, `n` as initially provided, `r` as initially provided, and `sum = 0`.

Output State: j = n + r + 1, n = initial n, r = initial r, sum = 0.
