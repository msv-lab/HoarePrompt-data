Postcondition: **`x` is the next element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reverse of `x`. If the length of `x` is equal to the length of `x_rev`, `rev_res` contains `x` and `rev_val` is an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_res` is empty and `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`.**
