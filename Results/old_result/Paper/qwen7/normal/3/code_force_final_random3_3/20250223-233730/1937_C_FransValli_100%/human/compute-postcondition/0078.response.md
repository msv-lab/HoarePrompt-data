Based on the initial state provided:

- `item` is now `arr[n-1]`, meaning `item` is the last element of the array `arr`.
- `mini` is the minimum value encountered in the array `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` based on the user's input ('>') comparisons during each iteration.
- `res` is an input string reflecting the user's choice ('<' or '>') for each comparison.

The print statement is:
```python
print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
```

Since `maxi` is not mentioned in the initial state, it is likely a typo or a placeholder for another variable. Given the context, it should be `mini` instead, as `mini` is the relevant minimum value encountered during the iterations.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **! mini mini**
