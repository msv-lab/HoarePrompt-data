Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` should start at 0 because `range(n)` generates values from 0 to n-1.
   - `n` must be a positive integer since `range(n)` requires `n` to be at least 1.

3. **Consider the other variables**:
   - `t`: This variable is not involved in the loop and its value does not affect the loop's execution.
   - `k`: This variable is modified inside the loop but its initial value does not affect whether the loop runs.
   - `a`: This list is used within the loop but its initial state does not affect whether the loop runs.
   - `m`: This variable is derived from the list `a` and does not affect the loop's execution.
   - `ans`: This variable is initialized to 0 and is updated inside the loop but its initial value does not affect whether the loop runs.

4. **Adjust the states of the relevant variables**:
   - `i` should be set to 0.
   - `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
