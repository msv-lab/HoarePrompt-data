Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3.
- `n` is an input integer and it is specified that `n` is less than 3.
- `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer. However, since `n` is less than 3, the list `w` will have fewer than 3 elements.

The print statement simply outputs `0`.

Output: **0**
