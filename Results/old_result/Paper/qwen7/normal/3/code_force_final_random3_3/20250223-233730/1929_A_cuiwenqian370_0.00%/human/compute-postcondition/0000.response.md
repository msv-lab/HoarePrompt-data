Output State: **`arr` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each integer in the list is in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9.**

The `sort()` method is called on the list `arr`, which sorts the elements of the list in place in non-decreasing order. The values of `n` and the individual elements of `arr` are not explicitly known, but they are now arranged in a sorted manner. The precondition that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 and each element in `arr` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) remains valid.
