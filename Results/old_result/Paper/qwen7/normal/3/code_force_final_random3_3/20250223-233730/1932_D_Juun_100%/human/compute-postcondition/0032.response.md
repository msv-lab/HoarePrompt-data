Output State: **`card` is no longer used, `rank` is the rank part of the original `card`, `suit` is the suit part of the original `card`, `trumps` is a list with an additional element which is the `rank`, `suits[suit]` is either `None` with `answers` containing one more element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `None` and `rank` with a space in between, or `suits[suit]` is set to `rank` with `answers` containing one more element if `suits[suit]` was `None`, otherwise `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`.**

This means that the `trumps` list now contains an additional element, which is the `rank`. Depending on the initial state of `suits[suit]`, it either remains `None` and `answers` gets updated, or it is set to `rank` and `answers` also gets updated accordingly.
