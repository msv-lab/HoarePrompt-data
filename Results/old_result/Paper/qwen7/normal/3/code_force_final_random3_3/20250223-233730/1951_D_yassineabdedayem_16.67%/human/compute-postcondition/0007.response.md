Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer read from standard input and `n` is not zero, `k` is an integer read from standard input and `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**.

This means that the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `number`, and `tab` remain unchanged. The variables `Min` and `Max` are now assigned based on the values of `n` and `k`. Specifically, `Min` is the minimum between `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` is the maximum between `int(n / k)` and `k`.
