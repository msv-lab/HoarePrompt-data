Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `not_mid`.

2. **Determine the Initial Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < not_mid`.
   - Therefore, `not_mid` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we need to ensure that the loop can start and run correctly.
   - We need to ensure that `not_mid` is greater than 0, and `i` is initialized to 0 (or any value that satisfies the loop condition).

Given the initial state:
- All elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` in the array `arr` are set to values starting from `small_element` and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent element.
- `cliquess` at indices from `left` to `left + mid - 1` are all set to the value `clique`.
- The variable `mid` remains greater than 0 after the loop completes.

We need to adjust the state such that the loop can start and run correctly.

**State:**
- `not_mid` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0 (or any value that ensures the loop starts).

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`not_mid` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**.
