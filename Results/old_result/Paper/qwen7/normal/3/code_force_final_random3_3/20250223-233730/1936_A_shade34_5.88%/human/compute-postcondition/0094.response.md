Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `1` to `n`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `mak` is 3. Additionally, a string input has been read and its value is less than the character `<`.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 4 (since the loop starts from 1).
   - The value of `n` must be greater than `i` (which is now 4) for the loop to execute again.

5. **String Input**: The string input has already been read and its value is less than the character `<`. This state does not change within the loop head, so it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 4, `mak` is 3, a string input has been read and its value is less than the character `<`, and `n` must be greater than 4**
