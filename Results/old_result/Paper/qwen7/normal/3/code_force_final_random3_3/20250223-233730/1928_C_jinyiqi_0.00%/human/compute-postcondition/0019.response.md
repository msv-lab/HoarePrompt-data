Output State: **The program returns a list that combines the divisors of x in descending order (from `output1`) with the corresponding quotients in descending order (from `output2`).**

This means the returned list starts with the largest divisor of `x` followed by its corresponding quotient, then the second largest divisor followed by its corresponding quotient, and so on until all divisors and their corresponding quotients are included in the returned list.
