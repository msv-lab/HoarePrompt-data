Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\)
   - `i` is 0
   - `a` is an input integer
   - `b` is an input integer
   - `m` is an input integer
   - After the execution of the if-else block, `m` is either less than both `a` and `b` (if the if condition is true), or `m` is not less than at least one of `a` or `b` (if the else condition is true).

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `t`. Therefore, `t` remains unchanged.

5. **States to Adjust**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from 0 to 1.
   - `t` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

6. **Final State**:
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `t` remains the same (it must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue).

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\)**.
