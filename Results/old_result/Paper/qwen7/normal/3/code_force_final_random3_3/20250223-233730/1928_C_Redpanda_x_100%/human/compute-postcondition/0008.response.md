Output State: **`factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer; `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded.**

Explanation: The code uses the `yield` keyword, which means it generates a value but does not assign it to a variable. Instead, it returns the value `factor * prime_to_i` and pauses the function's execution. The value of `factors[prime]` remains unchanged as no assignment operation is performed on it. Therefore, the only change is that the value `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded, while `factors[prime]` remains a non-negative integer.
