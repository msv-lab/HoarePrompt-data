You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        print(1, 1)
        
        print(1, 2)
        
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            print(i, i)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be at least 13.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will increment to match the value of `n`. The loop runs from `i = 3` to `i = n`, incrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `n`. Since the loop starts with `i` at 3 and increments by 1, the smallest possible value for `n` that allows the loop to run all its iterations is 13. Therefore, at the end of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n`, while `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but operates on two variables t and n, where t is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 50, and n is an integer within the range of 2 to 10^3. The function returns a value based on the relationship between t and n.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
