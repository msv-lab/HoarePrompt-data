Output State: **`ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus 2 times the new value of `s[x]`, `x` is increased by 1, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is the previous value of `j` plus 1**.

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated to include the previous value of `ans` plus twice the current value of `s[x]`. The value of `x` has been incremented by 1. The condition that `n` must be at least 2 remains unchanged. Additionally, `j` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.
