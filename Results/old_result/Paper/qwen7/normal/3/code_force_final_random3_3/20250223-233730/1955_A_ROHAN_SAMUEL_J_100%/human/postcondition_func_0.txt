The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers \( t \), \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates and prints either \( a \times n \) or \( \frac{n}{2} \times b + a \) or \( \frac{n}{2} \times b \) based on the conditions provided. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
