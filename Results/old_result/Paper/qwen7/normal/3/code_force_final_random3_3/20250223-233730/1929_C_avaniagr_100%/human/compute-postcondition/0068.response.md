Postcondition: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then `k` is decreased by 2, `x` is greater than `k - 3`, `a` remains unchanged, and `z` becomes the initial value of `z` plus the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration of `x - k + 3` times. If `x` is equal to or greater than `k - 1`, then no changes are made to `k`, `x`, and `a`, and `z` remains unchanged.**
