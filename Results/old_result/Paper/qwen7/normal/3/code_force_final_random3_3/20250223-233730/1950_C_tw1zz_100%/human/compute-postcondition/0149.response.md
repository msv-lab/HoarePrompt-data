Postcondition: `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of `s` and is either '00', '12', or '22', `m` is the minute part of `s` and is equal to `m1`, `h1` is either '10', '12', or '11', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'. If `h` is '22', then `h1` is '10', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00' or '12', then `h1` is '12', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '23', then `h1` is '11', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is 'PM'.
