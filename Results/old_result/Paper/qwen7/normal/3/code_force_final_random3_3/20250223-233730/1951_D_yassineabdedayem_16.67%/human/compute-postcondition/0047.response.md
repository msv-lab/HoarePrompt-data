Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the object `tab`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `tab`**:
   - From the given information, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of each `number` assigned during the loop's iterations.
   - Since the loop is about to start, `tab` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to the first element of `tab` when the loop starts.

4. **Initial State of Other Variables**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is 0 or less.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rep` is 60.
   - `number` is the last value assigned to `number` before the loop ended, which could be either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)`.
   - `tab` is a list containing the string representation of each `number` assigned during the loop's iterations.
   - `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration.
   - `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `tab` has at least one element for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `tab` to ensure it is non-empty.

### Final Answer:
State: **`tab` is a list that must have at least one element, t is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), n is 0 or less, k is 0, rep is 60, number is the last value assigned to `number` before the loop ended, Min is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration, Max is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration**.
