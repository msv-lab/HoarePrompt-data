Output State: **`i` is 0; `t` must be greater than 0; `string` is an input string; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `n` is the length of the list `s`; `done` is `False`**.

The variable `done` is assigned the boolean value `False`. No other changes are made to the variables `i`, `t`, `string`, `s`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
