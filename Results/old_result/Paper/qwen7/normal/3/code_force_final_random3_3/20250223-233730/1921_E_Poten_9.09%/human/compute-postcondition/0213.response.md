Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', and 'Alice'. If `clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` is true, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers` and `i` is set to 4. Otherwise, `answers` remains unchanged and `i` is set to 4. `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.
