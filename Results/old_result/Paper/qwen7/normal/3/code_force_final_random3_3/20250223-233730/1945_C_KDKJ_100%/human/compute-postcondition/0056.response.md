Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - i`, `ans` is unchanged or updated based on the condition.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `rsum` to `n - i`. All other variables (`n`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `rsum` and retains the initial values of the other variables.
