Output State: **`rank` is the rank part of the new card, `suit` is the suit part of the new card, `trump` remains the suit part of the next card, `trumps` is the list with the new `rank` appended to it, `suits[suit]` is now equal to `None`, `answers` is a list containing two strings which are the sorted concatenations of `rank` and `rank` joined by a space and `suit` and `suit` joined by a space.**

Explanation: The code `suits[suit] = None` updates the value of `suits[suit]` to `None`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
