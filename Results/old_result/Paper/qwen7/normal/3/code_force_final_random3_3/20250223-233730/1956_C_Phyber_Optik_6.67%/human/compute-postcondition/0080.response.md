Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 1.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `t`, `i`, and `r` have some initial values but are not relevant to the `print` statement.
- The current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. Since `n` must be at least 1 and `j` is currently 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `n` could be any positive integer starting from 1.

However, without the exact value of `n`, we can only describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **1 2 ... n** (where `n` is some integer greater than or equal to 1)
