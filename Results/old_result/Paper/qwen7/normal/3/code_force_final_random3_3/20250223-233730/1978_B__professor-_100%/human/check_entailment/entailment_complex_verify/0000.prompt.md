You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b, where n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three positive integers: the number of buns (n), the usual price of a bun (a), and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (b). For each test case, it calculates and prints the total revenue generated from selling all buns based on the given conditions. If the modified price (b) is less than or equal to the usual price (a), it prints the total revenue as if all buns were sold at the usual price. If the difference between the modified price and the usual price is greater than or equal to the number of buns, it calculates the revenue using a specific formula. Otherwise, it uses another formula to calculate the revenue.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not consider the scenario where `b` is between `a` and `n`. Let's analyze the logic:

1. If `b <= a`, the program correctly prints `n * a`.
2. If `b - a >= n`, the program correctly calculates the sum of an arithmetic series using the formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.
3. However, if `a < b < a + n`, the program does not handle this case correctly. It uses the formula `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`, which is incorrect because it does not account for the proper distribution of the modified prices.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 7`
- Expected output: The optimal choice is to sell the first two buns at 7 and 6 coins respectively, and the remaining three buns at 5 coins each. The total profit would be `7 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 28`.

However, the program outputs:
```
(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n = (7 - 5) * (7 - 5 + 1) // 2 + 5 * 5 = 2 * 3 // 2 + 25 = 3 + 25 = 28
```

This calculation is incorrect because it does not properly distribute the modified prices. The correct approach would be to calculate the sum of the modified prices directly.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases and thus the correctness is **False**.
