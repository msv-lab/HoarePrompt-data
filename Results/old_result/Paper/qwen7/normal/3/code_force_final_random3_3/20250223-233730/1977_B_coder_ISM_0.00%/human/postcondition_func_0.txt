The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4) and another positive integer \( x \) (1 ≤ \( x \) < 2^30). For each test case, it converts \( x \) into its binary representation, modifies the binary string according to specific rules, and prints the modified binary string along with its length. The final state of the program includes printing the modified binary string and its length for each test case.
