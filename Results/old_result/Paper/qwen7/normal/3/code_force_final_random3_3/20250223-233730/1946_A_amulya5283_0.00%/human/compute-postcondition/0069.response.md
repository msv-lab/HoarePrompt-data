Output State: `smallest` is 6, `heap` is now a list containing [5, 5, 6], `median_index` is 1, `current_median` is 5, `operations` is increased by 3.

Explanation: After the initial state and the first three iterations, we observe that the `smallest` value increases by 1 each time the loop runs, and the `heap` list also adjusts accordingly. The `median_index` remains at 1 because the length of the `heap` list is always 3, and the middle element (index 1) will always be the median. The `current_median` changes based on the updated `heap` list, and `operations` increases by 1 with each iteration. Since the loop continues as long as `heap[0] <= current_median`, and given the last known state where `heap[0]` is 4 and `current_median` is 5, the loop will run one more time. In this final iteration, `smallest` becomes 6, `heap` becomes [5, 5, 6], and `current_median` updates to 5.
