Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, and \((-1)^i\) is equal to 1; `answer` now contains the element `array[a[0]]`.**

Explanation: The code `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the element `array[a[0]]` to the list `answer`. However, the initial state does not provide any specific value for `a` or `array`, so we cannot determine what exactly was appended. But we know that `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, and \((-1)^i\) is equal to 1, which remains unchanged.
