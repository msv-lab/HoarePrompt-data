Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`cases`).
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex`, which is the encoded value.
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the indices of the letters.

3. **Filling the List `arr`**:
   - The program attempts to fill `arr` with values based on the condition checks:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 (for 'a') and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 27 and 51, it appends 26 (for 'z') and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - Otherwise, it appends 26 again and subtracts 26 from `lex`.

4. **Appending the Remaining Value**:
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.

5. **Sorting the List**:
   - The list `arr` is sorted.

6. **Printing the Result**:
   - It prints the characters corresponding to the values in `arr` using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Filling `arr`**:
   - The logic for filling `arr` is flawed. It does not correctly handle the encoding process. For example, for `lex = 24`, the program incorrectly appends 26 twice, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Sorting and Printing**:
   - Sorting `arr` after filling it may not give the correct result because the initial values are not correctly derived from the encoded value.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Determine the possible values for the first two letters based on the encoded value.
2. Ensure the third letter is the smallest possible value that fits the encoded value.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Determine the first letter
        if lex >= 27:
            first_letter = 1
            lex -= 26
        else:
            first_letter = lex
            lex = 0
        
        # Determine the second letter
        if lex >= 27:
            second_letter = 1
            lex -= 26
        else:
            second_letter = lex
            lex = 0
        
        # Determine the third letter
        third_letter = lex
        
        # Convert to characters
        print(f"{chr(first_letter + 96)}{chr(second_letter + 96)}{chr(third_letter + 96)}")

func()
```

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the original program, the provided solution is incorrect. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
