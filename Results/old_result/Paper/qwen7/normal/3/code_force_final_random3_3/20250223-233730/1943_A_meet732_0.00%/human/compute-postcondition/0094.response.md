Output State: **`cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `n` is an input integer, `t` is a new positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `cntl` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The values of `n`, `t`, and the list `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
