Output State: **`results` contains the value of `count` from the previous iteration, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are set to the values from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `freq` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `freq`. This does not affect the values of `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
