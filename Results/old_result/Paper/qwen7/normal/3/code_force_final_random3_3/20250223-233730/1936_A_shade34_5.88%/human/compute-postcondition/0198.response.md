Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `pans` is an empty list.
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `mak` is equal to `n-1`.
   - `mak2` is equal to `n-1`.
   - `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed `n-1` times.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `mak` and `mak2` both have the value `n-1`.
- `i` is less than `n`, but we don't have the exact value of `i`.
- `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed `n-1` times, but this does not affect the print statement directly.

Given these details, the print statement will output:
- The string `'?'`.
- The value of `mak`, which is `n-1`.
- The value of `mak2`, which is also `n-1`.
- The value of `i`, which is less than `n`.
- The value of `mak2`, which is again `n-1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? n-1 n-1 [i] n-1' (where [i] is a value less than n)**
