Output State: **`resb` is equal to `max(resb, curr)`, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, and all other variables retain their previous values.**

Explanation: The line `resb = max(resb, curr)` updates `resb` to be the maximum value between its current value and `curr`. Since `curr` is defined as `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `resb` is now set to the maximum of its previous value and this new expression. All other variables (`total`, `i`, `n`, `preb`, `pres`, `a`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, and `ps`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
