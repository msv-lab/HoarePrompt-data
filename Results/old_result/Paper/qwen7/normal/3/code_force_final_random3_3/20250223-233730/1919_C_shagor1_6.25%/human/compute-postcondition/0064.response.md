Output State: **`a` is the value of `y`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an updated input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `x` is \(n + 1\), `y` is `a`, and `x == y` is evaluated to False.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a` to `y`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `x` was previously equal to `y` (given by the condition `x == y` is evaluated to True), and now `y` has been reassigned to `a`, the condition `x == y` is no longer true.
