Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `N` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers with an additional element -1 appended to it, `s` is N + 1, `e` is 0, `num` is the value of `nums[N]`, `arr` is a list containing up to `N` tuples, each of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` where `i` ranges from 2 to `N + 1` inclusive, and `num` is updated to the current element in `nums` whenever a new tuple is added to `arr`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `s` will be set to `N + 1`, indicating the end of the range. The variable `num` will hold the last element of the `nums` list. The list `arr` will contain a series of tuples, starting from index 2 up to the length of `nums` (inclusive), capturing the transitions where the value in `nums` changes.
