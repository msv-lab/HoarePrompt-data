Postcondition: `c` is 2, `ans` is either the integer value of `ans` divided by `arr[l+1]` modulo `MOD` or `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is `n-1`, `l` is incremented by 1, `r` is decreased by 1 if `s[k] != 'L'`, otherwise `l` remains unchanged and `r` remains unchanged.
