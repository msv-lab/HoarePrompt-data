You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B'.
def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `ma` is 0, `mi` is the length of the string `s`, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string starting with 'B', `c` is the length of the string `s`, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, and `j` is the last character of `s`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `c` and check if the current character `j` is 'B'. Since the loop breaks as soon as it encounters the first 'B', `c` will eventually reach the length of the string `s`. The value of `mi` will be set to the position (index + 1) of the first 'B' encountered, or the length of the string if no 'B' is found. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: `ma` is the length of the string `s` - `d`, `mi` is the length of the string `s`, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string starting with 'B', `c` is the length of the string `s`, the current value of `j` is the last character of the original string `s`, `d` is equal to the length of the string `s`, `l` is an empty list, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns the difference between the length of string `s` minus `d` and the length of string `s`, plus 2.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes the following: an integer `t` (though not passed as a parameter), for each test case, an integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B'. It returns the difference between the length of string `s` minus `d` and the length of string `s`, plus 2.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the difference between the length of string `s` minus `d` and the length of string `s`, plus 2.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
