Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory list, `i` is n-1, `ends` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes an empty list named `ends`. This does not affect any of the existing variables (`t`, `u`, `v`, `n`, `empty`, `nodes`, `i`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The only new information introduced is the creation of the `ends` list, which is initially empty.
