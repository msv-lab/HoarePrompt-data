Output State: **`vis` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `i` is equal to `len(paths)`, `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - len(paths) + 1)`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the first input string converted to integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the third input string converted to integer, `ps` is the fourth input string converted to integer, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `vis` of length `n` with all elements set to 0. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `curr`, `pres`, `ress`, `a`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `pathb`, and `paths` remain unchanged from their initial states.
