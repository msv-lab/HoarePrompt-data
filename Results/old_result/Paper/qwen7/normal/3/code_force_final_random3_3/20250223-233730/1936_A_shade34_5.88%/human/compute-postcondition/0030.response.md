Output State: **`i` is equal to `mak`, `n` must be greater than 3, `s` is a string with the current value '<'**.

Explanation: The line `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `mak`. Since `i` can be 0, 1, or 2, `mak` will also take one of these values. The conditions for `n` and the value of `s` remain unchanged.
