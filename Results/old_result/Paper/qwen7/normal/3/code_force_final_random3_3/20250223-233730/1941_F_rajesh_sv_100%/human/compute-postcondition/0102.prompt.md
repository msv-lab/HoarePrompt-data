Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f) with the next value of `f`, `l` is updated to the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - f`, and `h` is set to bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1.
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f); `l` remains unchanged; `h` remains unchanged; `mid` remains unchanged; `mid_sum` remains unchanged; `mid_next_sum` remains unchanged; `left` remains unchanged; `right` remains unchanged; `f` remains unchanged; `D` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `mid_sum` is updated to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is updated to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `ans` remains unchanged, `l` and `h` remain unchanged, `mid` remains unchanged, `left` remains unchanged, `right` remains unchanged, `f` remains unchanged, `D` remains unchanged, and `l < h` must still hold true.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `mid_sum` is updated to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is updated to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `ans` remains unchanged, `l` and `h` may either remain unchanged or `l` is updated to `mid + 1` while `h` is updated to `mid`. `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `left` remains unchanged, `right` remains unchanged, `f` remains unchanged, `D` remains unchanged, and `l < h` must still hold true.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
