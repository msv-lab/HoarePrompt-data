Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `count`, which is greater than 0.
- `n` is the length of the list `s`.
- `x` is the first element of the list `s`.
- `done` is `False`.
- `count2` is either `count` (if `s[j]` equals `x`), or it remains as the last calculated value.
- `i` is 1.
- `t` is 1.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string.
- The condition `(not done)` is true.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print(1)
```

This statement will print the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
