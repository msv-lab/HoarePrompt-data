### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated version step-by-step to verify the original assessment.

#### Problem Description:
- Nikita can only add or remove exactly one cube per move.
- After `n` moves, the resulting tower should have exactly `m` cubes.
- The difference between `n` and `m` must be even and non-negative for it to be possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.

#### Given Program:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

#### Annotated Code:
- The program reads the number of test cases `kreker`.
- For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.
- `func_1()` reads two integers `n` and `m` and checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
- If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program incorrectly handles the case where `n` is less than `m`.
- It suggests changing the condition to check `abs(n - m)` instead of just `n - m`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Case where `n > m`:**
   - If `n > m`, then `n - m` is positive.
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is correct because `n - m` is positive and even.
   - Example: `n = 3`, `m = 1` → `n - m = 2` (even and non-negative).

2. **Case where `n < m`:**
   - If `n < m`, then `n - m` is negative.
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is false because `n - m` is negative.
   - Example: `n = 2`, `m = 4` → `n - m = -2` (negative).
   - This is correct because it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves when `n < m`.

3. **Case where `n = m`:**
   - If `n = m`, then `n - m = 0`.
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is true because `0` is even and non-negative.
   - Example: `n = 5`, `m = 5` → `n - m = 0` (even and non-negative).

4. **Case where `n` and `m` differ by an odd number:**
   - If `n` and `m` differ by an odd number, then `abs(n - m)` is odd.
   - The condition `(abs(n - m) % 2 == 0 and abs(n - m) >= 0)` is false because `abs(n - m)` is odd.
   - Example: `n = 3`, `m = 2` → `abs(n - m) = 1` (odd).
   - This is correct because it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves when `n` and `m` differ by an odd number.

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement. The original assessment was incorrect because the program already checks the necessary conditions without needing to use `abs(n - m)`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
