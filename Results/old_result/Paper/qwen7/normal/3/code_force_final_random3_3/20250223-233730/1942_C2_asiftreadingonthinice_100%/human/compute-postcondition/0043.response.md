Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the sum of all increments made to it during the loop, and `tmp` contains all the values added to it whenever `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and equals to 2 modulo 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is equal to 2, then `ans` is incremented by 1. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even, then `tmp` will have an additional element which is `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.
