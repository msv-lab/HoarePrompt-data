Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `for i in range(1, n + 1)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i`, `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. Since `i` starts at 1, the loop will execute as long as `i <= n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. This means `i` should be 1 initially, and `n` should be a positive integer (since `t` is a positive integer, we can assume `n` is also a positive integer).

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be a positive integer**
