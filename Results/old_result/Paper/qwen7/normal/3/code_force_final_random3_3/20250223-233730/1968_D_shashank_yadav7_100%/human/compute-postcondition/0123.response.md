Output State: **`k` is an integer, `b` is `b - 1`, `s` is `s - 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())`, `bm` is `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] + sp + n * a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp + n * a[b]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `sp` is now equal to `a[s]`, and `bp` is updated to `a[b]`, `bm` is updated to `a[b] * k**.

Explanation: The code updates `bm` to `a[b] * k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
