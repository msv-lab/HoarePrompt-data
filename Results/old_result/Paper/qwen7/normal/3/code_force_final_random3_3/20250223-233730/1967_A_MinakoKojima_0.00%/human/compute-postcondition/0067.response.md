Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the next positive integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is 0, and `i` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` sets the variable `ans` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
