Output State: **`lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list containing the elements [1, 26]**.

Explanation: Initially, if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` contains the value 1. If `lex` is between 26 and 51, `arr` remains unchanged and still contains the element 26. The code snippet appends the value 26 to `arr`. Since the initial conditions specify that if `lex` is between 26 and 51, `arr` contains the element 26, appending 26 to `arr` results in `arr` containing both 1 and 26.
