Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value (either `lex - 1` if `lex <= 26` or `lex - 26` if `lex > 26`), and `arr` contains the elements [26, 26, 1]**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` adds the integer `1` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contained `[26, 26]`. After appending `1`, `arr` now contains `[26, 26, 1]`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged from their initial states.
