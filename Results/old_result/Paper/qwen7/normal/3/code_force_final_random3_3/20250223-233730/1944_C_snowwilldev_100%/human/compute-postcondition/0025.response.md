Postcondition: `t` is 3, `N` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value 0 where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`, and the count of `i` in `cnt` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 2. The program returns 1.
