Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is a value within the range `[0, n - 1)`, `cnt` is 2 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, and 1 otherwise.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was either 0 or 1, after incrementing, `i` will now be either 1 or 2. The values of `j` and `cnt` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
