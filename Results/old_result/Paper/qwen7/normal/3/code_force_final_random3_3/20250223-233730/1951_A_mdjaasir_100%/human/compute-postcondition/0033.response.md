Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string from the user, `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`. If `count` is 0, then `count` remains 0. Otherwise, `count` is greater than 0, where `count` is either greater than 2 and even, or not greater than 2.
