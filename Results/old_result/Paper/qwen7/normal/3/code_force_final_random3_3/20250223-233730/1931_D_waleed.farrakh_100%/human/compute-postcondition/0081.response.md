Output State: **All elements in `arr` have been processed, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`, `count` is incremented by the sum of `freq[(a % x, a % y)]` for each `a` in `arr`, and `freq` contains the frequency of each unique pair `(a % x, a % y)` found in `arr`.**

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, processing every element in `arr`. The variable `count` reflects the cumulative sum of occurrences of pairs `(rx, ry)` where `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` and `ry = a % y`, as these pairs are found in `freq`. The dictionary `freq` keeps track of how many times each unique pair `(a % x, a % y)` appears in `arr`.
