Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is 0 or less, `k` is 0, `rep` is 60, `number` is the last value assigned to `number` before the loop ended (which would be either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)` depending on the final condition check), `tab` is a list containing the string representation of each `number` assigned during the loop's iterations, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in tab:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tab` is a list that must have at least one element, t is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), n is 0 or less, k is 0, rep is 60, number is the last value assigned to `number` before the loop ended, Min is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration, Max is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is the first element of `tab`, `tab` is the list of remaining elements from `tab`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the second element of `tab`, `tab` is the list of remaining elements from `tab`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
