### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to partition a string `s` into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes.
- If such a partition is possible, we should print "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves.
- If it is not possible, we should print "NO".

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function should check if the string can be split into non-palindromic substrings.
- If the string can be split, it should print "YES" and the number of parts along with the parts.
- If not, it should print "NO".

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Reading Input and Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It handles the case where the string length is 1 by immediately printing 'NO' and continuing to the next test case.
   - It checks if the first character `x` is different from the last character. If so, it prints 'YES' and the entire string as the partition, which is correct because a single-character string is not a palindrome.

2. **Handling Single Character Repetition:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same, the program correctly prints 'NO', indicating no valid partition can be made.
   - If the string has a single unique character and the length is odd, it correctly prints 'NO' because the middle character would form a palindrome.

3. **Checking for Non-Palindromic Substrings:**
   - The program iterates through the string to find the first non-palindromic pair of characters.
   - If found, it prints 'YES' and the entire string as the partition, which is incorrect because we need to split the string into more than one part.
   - If no such pair is found, it attempts to split the string into two parts based on the first non-matching character, but this logic is flawed and incomplete.

4. **Flawed Logic for Partitioning:**
   - The logic for splitting the string into two parts based on the first non-matching character is incorrect. It does not guarantee that the resulting substrings will not be palindromes.
   - The program fails to handle cases where the string can be split into more than two parts without forming palindromes.

5. **Handling Remaining Cases:**
   - The program does not cover all possible cases where the string can be split into multiple non-palindromic parts. For example, it does not handle strings like "aab" or "abcde" correctly.

#### Correct Implementation:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the string is split into non-palindromic substrings. Here is a corrected approach:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def can_partition(s):
    n = len(s)
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if is_palindrome(s[i:n-i]):
            return False
    return True

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        string = input()
        if can_partition(string):
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This implementation checks if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings by ensuring no substring is a palindrome. If the string itself is not a palindrome and cannot be split into palindromic substrings, it prints "YES" and the entire string. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

#### Final Evaluation:
Given the corrected implementation, the original program's logic is flawed and does not guarantee a valid partition in all scenarios. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
