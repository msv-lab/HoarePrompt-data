Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `left` and `right`, which are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, and `clique`, which is an integer representing the clique identifier. The function returns an array (or list) based on the given range and clique identifier.**

This means the function takes two integers `left` and `right` defining a range and an integer `clique` as identifiers. It then generates and returns an array based on these inputs, without specifying the exact content of the array other than its dependence on the given range and clique identifier.
