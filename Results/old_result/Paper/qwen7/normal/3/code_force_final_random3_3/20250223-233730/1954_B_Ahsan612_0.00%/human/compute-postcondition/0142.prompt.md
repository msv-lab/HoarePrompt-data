Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    same = 1
    num = ar[0]
    minn = inf
    i = 1
    while i < len(ar):
        if ar[i] == num:
            same += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            num = ar[i]
            minn = min(minn, same)
            same = 1
        i += 1
    minn = min(minn, same)
    if minn == inf:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of the list `ar`, `same` is the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`, `num` is the last number in the list `ar` that had the highest count of consecutive occurrences, and `minn` is the minimum value between `infinity` and the maximum `same` value found during the loop execution, and `minn` is updated to be the minimum of `minn` and `same`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `minn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `same`; `num` is set to the last `min(minn, same)` value found; `same` is 1 if no further elements were matched after setting `num` to the last `min(minn, same)` value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `minn` is the minimum value between the initial value of `minn` (either 1 or the minimum value found in the list `ar` starting from index 1) and `same`; `same` is the total number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in the list `ar`, `num` is the last element of the list `ar` that was checked (which will be different from the first element if there was a change), and `i` is equal to `len(ar)`. If `minn` was initially infinity, it is now set to either the initial value of `minn` or `same`, depending on which is smaller. Otherwise, `minn` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
