Postcondition: `i` is 1, `len(a)` is at least 1, and `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is either equal to 2 or not equal to 2. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is equal to 2, then `ans` is 1. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2, then `tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if `(a[i] - a[i - 1])` is even, otherwise `tmp` remains unchanged.
