Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n is an input integer, m is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range 1 to 100, while `n` and `m` are the integers input by the user.
