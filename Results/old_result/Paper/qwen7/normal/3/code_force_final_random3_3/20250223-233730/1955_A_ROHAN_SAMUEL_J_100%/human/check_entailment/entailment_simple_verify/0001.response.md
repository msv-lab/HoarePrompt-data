### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - It then processes each test case using a loop that runs `t` times.

2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**:
   - For each test case, the program reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The program checks if `n` is odd (`if n % 2`):
     - If `n` is odd, it further checks if the cost of two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`).
       - If `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n` (cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price).
       - Otherwise, it calculates the cost by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price (`n // 2 * b + a`).
   - If `n` is even, it directly checks if the cost of two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n` (cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price).
     - Otherwise, it prints `n // 2 * b` (cost of buying all yogurts at the promotion price).

#### Verification with Example Cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Calculation:
     - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - Since `n` is even, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`
     - Print `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Calculation:
     - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - Since `n` is odd, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`
     - Print `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - Since `n` is odd, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`
     - Print `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - Since `n` is even, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`
     - Print `n // 2 * b = 2 * 11 = 22`

#### Detailed Analysis:

- **Odd `n`**:
  - The logic for odd `n` is correct. It checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than the promotion price. If so, it buys as many pairs as possible and the remaining one at the regular price.
  - For `n = 3` and `b = 11`, the correct minimum cost is indeed `15` because buying two at `5` and one at `5` is cheaper than buying three at `11`.

- **Even `n`**:
  - The logic for even `n` is also correct. It checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than the promotion price. If so, it buys all yogurts at the regular price; otherwise, it buys all at the promotion price.
  - For `n = 4` and `b = 11`, the correct minimum cost is `22` because buying all four at `5` is cheaper than buying two pairs at `11`.

#### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles both odd and even values of `n` and accurately computes the minimum cost based on the given conditions. The provided example cases and the logic within the program match the expected results.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
