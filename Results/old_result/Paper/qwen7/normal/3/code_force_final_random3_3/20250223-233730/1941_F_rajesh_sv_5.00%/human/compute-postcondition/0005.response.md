The only object in the loop head is the variable `testcases`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `testcases`. For the loop to execute again, `testcases` must be greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration.

Since the loop is decrementing `testcases` by 1 each iteration (though the exact operation within the loop body is omitted), for the loop to execute one more time, `testcases` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `testcases` must be greater than 1.

State: **`testcases` must be greater than 1**
