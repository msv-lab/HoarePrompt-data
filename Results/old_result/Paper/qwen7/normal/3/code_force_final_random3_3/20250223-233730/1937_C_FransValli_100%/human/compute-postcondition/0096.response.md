Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is described as being greater than 3 but no specific value is provided for `n`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `'?'` is a literal string that will be printed.
- `maxi` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value precisely. Since it is not defined, we cannot substitute a specific value for `maxi`.
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.

Therefore, the output will include the string `'?'` followed by `maxi` twice, followed by `i` twice (which is 3).

Output: **'? [maxi] [maxi] 3 3' (where [maxi] is the value of maxi, which is unknown based on the given information)**
