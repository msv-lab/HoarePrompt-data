Based on the initial state provided:

- `wins` is explicitly given as 3.
- `i` is 9999.
- `n` is at least 2, but its exact value is not specified.
- `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and the condition `wins` is greater than or equal to `k` holds true.

Given these details, we need to determine the value of `wins - 1`.

Since `wins` is explicitly given as 3, we can directly compute `wins - 1` as follows:
\[ \text{wins} - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2 \]

Therefore, the print statement will output the value 2.

Output: **2**
