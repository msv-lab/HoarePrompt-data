Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and after the execution of the if-else block, `m` is either less than both `a` and `b` (if the if condition is true), or `m` is not less than at least one of `a` or `b` (if the else condition is true).
