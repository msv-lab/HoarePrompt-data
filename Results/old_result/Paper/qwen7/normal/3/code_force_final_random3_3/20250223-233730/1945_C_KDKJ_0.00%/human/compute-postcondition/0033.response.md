Output State: **`i` is 0; `left` is `S[0][0]`; `lsum` is `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`; `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`.**

The code `rsum = n - lsum` calculates `rsum` as `n - lsum`. Here, `lsum` is known to be `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`. So, `rsum` becomes `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`. The values of `i`, `left`, and `lsum` remain unchanged.
