Output State: **`results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` reflects the cumulative sum of occurrences of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` across all elements in `arr`, and `residue_map` records how many times each unique pair `(num % x, num % y)` appears in `arr`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` to the list `results`. Since `count` was already updated to reflect the cumulative sum of occurrences of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` across all elements in `arr`, and `residue_map` was updated to record how many times each unique pair `(num % x, num % y)` appears in `arr`, these values remain unchanged. The only new information added is the value of `count` to the `results` list.
