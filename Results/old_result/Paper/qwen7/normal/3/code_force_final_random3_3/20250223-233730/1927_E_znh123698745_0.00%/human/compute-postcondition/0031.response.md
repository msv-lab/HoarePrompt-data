Based on the initial state provided, the `answer` list will contain the first `n-1` elements of the `array` depending on the conditions specified in the loop. Let's break down the process:

1. The loop runs `n-1` times.
2. For each iteration `i`:
   - If `(-1) ** i` equals -1, the element from `array` at index `a[-1] - 1` is appended to `answer`, and `a[-1]` is decremented by 1.
   - Otherwise, the element from `array` at index `a[0]` is appended to `answer`, and `a[0]` is incremented by 1.

Given these conditions, let's consider the two scenarios:

### Scenario 1: `(-1) ** i` equals -1 for all odd `i` up to `n-1`
- This means that for odd `i`, the element from the end of `array` (index `a[-1] - 1`) is appended to `answer`, and `a[-1]` is decremented by 1.
- For even `i`, the element from the start of `array` (index `a[0]`) is appended to `answer`, and `a[0]` is incremented by 1.

Since `a[-1]` starts at the last index of `array` and is decremented by 1 each time `(-1) ** i` is -1 (which happens for all odd `i`), `a[-1]` will eventually reach -1 after `n-1` iterations. Therefore, the loop will stop appending elements to `answer` once `a[-1]` reaches -1.

In this scenario, `answer` will contain the last `n-1` elements of `array`.

### Scenario 2: `(-1) ** i` equals 1 for all even `i` up to `n-1`
- This means that for even `i`, the element from the end of `array` (index `a[-1] - 1`) is appended to `answer`, and `a[-1]` is decremented by 1.
- For odd `i`, the element from the start of `array` (index `a[0]`) is appended to `answer`, and `a[0]` is incremented by 1.

Since `a[0]` starts at the first index of `array` and is incremented by 1 each time `(-1) ** i` is 1 (which happens for all even `i`), `a[0]` will eventually reach `n` after `n-1` iterations. Therefore, the loop will stop appending elements to `answer` once `a[0]` reaches `n`.

In this scenario, `answer` will contain the first `n-1` elements of `array`.

Given that the loop will run `n-1` times and will either append elements from the end or the start of `array` based on the conditions, the final `answer` will be the first `n-1` elements of `array` if `(-1) ** i` equals 1 for all even `i` up to `n-1`.

Thus, the output will be the first `n-1` elements of the `array`.

Output: **[array[0], array[1], ..., array[n-2]]**
