Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - The problem statement mentions that `i` is initially `n + 1`.
   - `n` is stated to be between 2 and 24.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n + 1`.
   - For each iteration, the loop body is omitted, but we know that the loop appends indices to `sb` based on certain conditions.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to `n + 1`, this value should be correct at the start of the loop.
   - `n` must be within the specified range (2 to 24) for the loop to execute properly.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `i` should be `n + 1`.
- `n` should be between 2 and 24.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is between 2 and 24**
