Output State: **`count` is 0, `results` is `[0]`, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `n` is the number of elements in the next test case array, `x` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `y` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `arr` is the next test case array, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_y = num % y`, `current_key = (num % x, num % y)`**

Explanation: The code assigns a new value to `current_key`, which is a tuple consisting of `num % x` and `num % y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
