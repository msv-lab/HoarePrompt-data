Output State: `func_1()` has already been called three times.

Explanation: The loop runs for a number of iterations specified by the user input. Based on the provided output states, each iteration of the loop calls `func_1()`. After the loop executes 3 times, `func_1()` has been called twice. Therefore, if the loop were to run to completion, `func_1()` would be called as many times as the loop iterates. Since no further information about the changes inside `func_1()` or any other variables outside the loop is given, we can conclude that `func_1()` will be called one more time if the loop completes all its iterations.
