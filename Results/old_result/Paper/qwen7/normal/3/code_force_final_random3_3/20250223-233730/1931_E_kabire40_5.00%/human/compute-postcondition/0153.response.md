Output State: **`rev_val` is a non-empty list, `rev_res` is a string with the value of the element at index `x` in `rev_val` reversed appended to it, `x` is incremented by 1, `val_in` is the element at index `x-1` in `rev_val`.**

Explanation: The code appends the reverse of the element at index `x` in `rev_val` to `rev_res`. The value of `x` is incremented by 1 after this operation, and `val_in` now refers to the element at the new index `x-1` in `rev_val`. The initial values of `rev_val` and `rev_res` remain unchanged except for the operations performed.
