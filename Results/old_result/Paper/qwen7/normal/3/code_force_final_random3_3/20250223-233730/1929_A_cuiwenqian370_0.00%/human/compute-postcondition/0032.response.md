Output State: `left` is `n - 1`, `right` is 0, and `new_arr` contains all elements from `arr` added in pairs starting from the ends towards the center.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `left` will be equal to `n - 1` and `right` will be 0, indicating that the entire range has been processed. The `new_arr` will contain all elements from the original `arr` but in a specific order: starting from the largest and smallest elements, then the second largest and second smallest, and so on, until all elements have been added.
