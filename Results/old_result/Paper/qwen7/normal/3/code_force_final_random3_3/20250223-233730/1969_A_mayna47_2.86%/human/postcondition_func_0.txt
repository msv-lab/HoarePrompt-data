The function reads an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers from the user. It then checks if `n` is 2, in which case it prints 2. If `n` is not 2, it iterates through the list and checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i` for any `i`. If this condition is found to be false, it prints 3. The function does not return any value.
