Output State: **`smallest` is 3, `heap` is now a list containing [2, 4, 4], `median_index` is 1, `current_median` is 4**

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value of `smallest + 1` (which is `3 + 1 = 4`) onto the heap. Since the heap was initially `[2, 4]`, after pushing `4`, the heap becomes `[2, 4, 4]`. The `median_index` remains 1 because the heap size has increased by one, making the median the middle element, which is now `4`. The `smallest` variable and `current_median` remain unchanged.
