Output State: **`ln` is an input integer, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` such that `d[j] >= 3`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `palka` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`, `pl` is a list that contains all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared, `w` must be greater than 0, `palka` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `palka = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `palka`. None of the other variables (`ln`, `shapes`, `d`, `pl`, `w`) are affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain as described in the initial state.
