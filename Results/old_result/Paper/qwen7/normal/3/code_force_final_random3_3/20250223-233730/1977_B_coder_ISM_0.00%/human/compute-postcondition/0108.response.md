Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3.
- `length` is at least 29.
- `flag` is either 0 or 1.
- `s[0]` is '-1'.
- `s[1]` is '1'.
- `s[2]` is '0'.
- For all `i` from 3 to 28, `s[i]` is '0'.
- `s[29]` is '1'.
- `s[30]` is '1'.

The `print(*s)` statement will print the contents of the list `s` separated by spaces. Given the values described, the list `s` will look like this:

`['-1', '1', '0', '0', '0', ..., '0', '1', '1']`

Here, there are 28 zeros between `s[2]` and `s[29]`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **'-1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1'**
