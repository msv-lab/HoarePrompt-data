You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and arr is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        
        left += 1
        
        right -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `left` is `n - 1`, `right` is 1, and `new_arr` is a list containing all elements from `arr` but in reverse order.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `left` will be equal to `right + 1`, which means `left` will be `n - 1` and `right` will be 1. During each iteration, the loop appends elements from the ends towards the center of the original array `arr` into `new_arr`. Therefore, `new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` in reverse order.
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `max_beauty` is increased by the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements from index 1 to `left + 1` in the `new_arr` list, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is equal to `left + 1`, and the values of `left`, `right`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged.
    #
    #To break it down further:
    #- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1` (where `n` is initially `left + 1`), adding the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]` to `max_beauty`.
    #- After all iterations, `max_beauty` will contain the total sum of these absolute differences.
    #- The values of `left`, `right`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
    #- `i` will be equal to `n` after the last iteration, which is `left + 1`.
    #- `n` will also be equal to `left + 1` after the loop completes.
    return max_beauty
    #The program returns max_beauty which is increased by the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements from index 1 to left + 1 in the new_arr list, where i is equal to n (which is left + 1), and the values of left, right, and new_arr remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `arr` of `n` integers (each integer in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9). It returns `max_beauty`, which is increased by the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements from index 1 to `left + 1` in the `new_arr` list, where `i` is equal to `n` (which is `left + 1`), and the values of `left`, `right`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns max_beauty which is increased by the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements from index 1 to left + 1 in the new_arr list, where i is equal to n (which is left + 1), and the values of left, right, and new_arr remain unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
