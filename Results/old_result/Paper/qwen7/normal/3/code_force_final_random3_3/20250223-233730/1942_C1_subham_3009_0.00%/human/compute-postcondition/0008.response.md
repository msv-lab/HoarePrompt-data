The loop condition is `t > 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer between 0 and 9999, inclusive. To ensure the loop can execute again, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, we need to adjust `t` to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer entered, `x` is the second integer entered, `y` is the third integer entered; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from converting the first `x` elements of the original list of strings.**
