Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is False, `count` is 1, `count2` is 2, `i` is 1, `t` is 1.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes all the variables from the initial state without any modifications.
