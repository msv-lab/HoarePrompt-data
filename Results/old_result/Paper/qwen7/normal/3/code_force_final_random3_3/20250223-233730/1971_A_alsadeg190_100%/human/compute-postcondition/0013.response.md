Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer from the split input, and `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the first and second integers from the input respectively, regardless of the outcome of the if condition.**
