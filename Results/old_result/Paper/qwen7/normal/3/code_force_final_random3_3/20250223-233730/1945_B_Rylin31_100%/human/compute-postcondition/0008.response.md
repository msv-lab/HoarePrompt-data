Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers entered by the user, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, `m` is the third integer entered.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m` respectively. The initial state of `t` and `i` remains unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are now the integers entered by the user.
