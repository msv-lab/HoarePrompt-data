Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and 3, and `i` is 3. If `n` is less than or equal to `x // 3`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of `ans` and `x // 3`. If `n` is greater than `x // 3`, no change occurs to the variables.
