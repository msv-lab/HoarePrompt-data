Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial states:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` equals `t`.
   - `m` is the second integer input split from the same input line.
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
   - If `k` is a power of 2, it remains unchanged. If `k` is not a power of 2, it is reduced to zero through a series of subtractions, and additional variables `l`, `p`, and `q` are defined where `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(int(input()))`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments:**
   - The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
   - The loop condition depends on the value of `i` and the input to `int(input())`.

Given that the loop runs for `i` in `range(int(input()))`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the integer input.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is derived from the first input and does not change within the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is derived from `t` and does not change within the loop.
   - `m` remains unchanged because it is derived from the second input and does not change within the loop.
   - `k` remains unchanged because it is derived from `n` and `m` and does not change within the loop.
   - `l`, `p`, and `q` are derived from `k` and do not change within the loop.

5. **New State After One More Iteration:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - The loop will continue if `i` is still less than the integer input.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue if `i` is still less than the integer input.

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues if `i` is less than the integer input**.

To express this in the required format:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues if `i` is less than the integer input**.
