Output State: **`trumps` is sorted. The `suits` dictionary remains unchanged, and the `answers` list remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `trumps = sorted(trumps)` sorts the `trumps` list. However, since the `suits` dictionary and the `answers` list are not affected by this operation, their states remain the same. The `trumps` list is updated to be sorted.
