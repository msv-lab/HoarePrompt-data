Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\). This means `t` can take any value from 1 to 50, but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `i` is explicitly stated to be 4.
- `n` must be at least 13, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i, i)
```

This will print the value of `i` twice. Since `i` is explicitly given as 4, the output will be:
Output: **4 4**
