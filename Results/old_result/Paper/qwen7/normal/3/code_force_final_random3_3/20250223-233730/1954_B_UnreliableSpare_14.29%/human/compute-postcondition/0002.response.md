Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `flag` is True.**

Explanation: The line `flag = True` sets the variable `flag` to the boolean value `True`. No other changes are made to the existing variables `t`, `n`, and `arr`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
