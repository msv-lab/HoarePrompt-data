Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
2. A beautiful array is defined such that by choosing an index \(i\) (where \(2 \le i \le n-1\)) such that \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\), you can replace \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\).
3. The solution logic is as follows:
   - First, it checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it outputs -1 because no removals are needed to make it non-beautiful.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements. This is because removing these consecutive elements would break the beauty condition.
4. The provided code correctly implements this logic:
   - It reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
   - It checks if all elements are the same using a set. If true, it prints -1.
   - Otherwise, it counts the maximum length of consecutive identical elements and uses this to determine the minimum number of elements to remove.
   - The final result is printed for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
