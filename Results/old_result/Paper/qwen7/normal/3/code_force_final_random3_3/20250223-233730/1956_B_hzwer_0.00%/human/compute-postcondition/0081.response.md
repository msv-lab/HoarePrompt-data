Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is `n-2`; `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` where each element is updated to the maximum value it can take based on the conditions specified in the loop body except for the element at index `[i][j]` which is now equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; the `cards` list also remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to be equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. Since `i` is either 0 or 1, `i + 1` will be either 1 or 2. However, the exact value of `dp[i + 1][j]` depends on the conditions specified in the loop body, which are not provided here. The other elements of the `dp` list remain unchanged, and all other variables (`j`, `t`, `n`, and the `cards` list) remain unaffected.
