Based on the initial state provided:

- `z` is the result of repeatedly adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to itself for `x + 1` times.
- `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.
- `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial or first iteration values.
- `t` remains greater than 0.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
