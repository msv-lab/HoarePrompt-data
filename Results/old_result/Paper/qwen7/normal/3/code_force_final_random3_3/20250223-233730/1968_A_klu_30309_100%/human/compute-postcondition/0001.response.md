Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `x` and `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `x`**: The loop will iterate over each element in `test_cases`. Therefore, `x` will take on the values from `test_cases` one by one.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `test_cases`**: Since the loop will iterate over all elements in `test_cases`, `test_cases` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

4. **Initial State of `results`**: The initial state of `results` is given as an empty list, and this does not affect the loop's execution directly.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `test_cases` contains at least one element for the loop to execute. The value of `x` will be set to the first element of `test_cases` during the first iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `test_cases` must contain at least one element.
- `x` will be the first element of `test_cases`.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `test_cases` is a list that must have at least one element, `results` is an empty list, `x` is the first element of `test_cases`**
