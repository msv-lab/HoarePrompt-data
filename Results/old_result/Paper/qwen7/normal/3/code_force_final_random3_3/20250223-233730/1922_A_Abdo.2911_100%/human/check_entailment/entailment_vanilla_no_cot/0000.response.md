Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in determining whether a template exists that satisfies the conditions. Specifically, the logic for checking if a template is possible is incorrect. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Condition Handling**: The program checks if `c[i]` should match `a[i]` or `b[i]` when `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different. However, it does not correctly handle the case where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different but `c[i]` should not match either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.

2. **Template Possibility Check**: The program sets `possible` to `True` if `c[i]` does not match `a[i]` when `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same. This is not sufficient to determine if a template exists. It needs to ensure that for every position, the conditions for matching `a` and `b` and not matching `c` are met consistently.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        possible = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if a[i].islower() and c[i] == a[i]:
                    possible = False
                    break
                elif a[i].isupper() and c[i].islower() and c[i] == a[i].lower():
                    possible = False
                    break
            else:
                if a[i].islower() and b[i].islower() and c[i] == a[i]:
                    possible = False
                    break
                elif a[i].isupper() and b[i].isupper() and c[i].islower() and c[i] == a[i].lower():
                    possible = False
                    break
        
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the conditions for matching `a` and `b` and not matching `c` are checked correctly for each position in the strings.
