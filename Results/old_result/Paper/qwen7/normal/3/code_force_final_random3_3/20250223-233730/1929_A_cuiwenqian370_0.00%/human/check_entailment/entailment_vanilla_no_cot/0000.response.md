Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly maximize the beauty of the array. The logic in `func_1` aims to alternate between the smallest and largest remaining elements but does not guarantee the maximum possible beauty. Instead, we should aim to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones.

To achieve the maximum beauty, we should sort the array and then pair the smallest element with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. This way, we ensure that the differences are maximized.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, arr)
    results.append(result)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(arr[i] - arr[i - 1])
    return max_beauty
```

This version correctly calculates the maximum beauty by sorting the array and summing the absolute differences between adjacent elements after rearranging them optimally.
