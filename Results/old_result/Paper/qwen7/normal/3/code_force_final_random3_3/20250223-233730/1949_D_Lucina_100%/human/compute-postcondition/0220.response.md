Postcondition: `nx` is a string, `i` is 1, and `j` is `k + 2`. If the character at index `i` (which is 1) and `j - 1` (which is `k + 1`) in `xx` is not '?', then the last character of `nx` is added with the character at index `k + 1` in `xx`. Otherwise, if either `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` remains 'Fnx'. Otherwise, `nx` is changed to 'S' concatenated with the original string value of `nx`.
