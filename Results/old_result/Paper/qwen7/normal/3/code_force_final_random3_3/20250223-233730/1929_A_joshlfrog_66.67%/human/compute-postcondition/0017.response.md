Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `range(l)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `l`.

2. **Determine the Current Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `e` is 0.
   - `l` is a positive integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces.
   - `x` is the value of `nums[i]`.
   - `y` is the minimum value between the original `y` and `nums[i]`, where `i` is 0.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increases by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
   - `l` remains the same unless the loop body modifies it, but since no such modification is mentioned, `l` stays the same.

4. **Update the Other States**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `e` remains 0 as it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `x` will now be the value of `nums[1]` because `i` is incremented to 1.
   - `y` will be the minimum value between the original `y` and `nums[1]`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `e` is 0, `l` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `x` is the value of `nums[1]`, and `y` is the minimum value between the original `y` and `nums[1]`**.
