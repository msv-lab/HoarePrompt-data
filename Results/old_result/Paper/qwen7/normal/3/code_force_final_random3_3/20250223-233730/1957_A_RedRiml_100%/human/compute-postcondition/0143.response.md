Output State: **`shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3 + (shapes - d[j] // 3)`, `pl` must have at least one element, and the current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3**.

Explanation: The code `shapes += d[j] // 3` increases the value of `shapes` by `d[j] // 3`. The precondition states that `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, and `shapes` is already increased by `d[j] // 3`. Therefore, the new value of `shapes` is the original value of `shapes` plus `d[j] // 3`. The condition that `pl` must have at least one element remains unchanged.
