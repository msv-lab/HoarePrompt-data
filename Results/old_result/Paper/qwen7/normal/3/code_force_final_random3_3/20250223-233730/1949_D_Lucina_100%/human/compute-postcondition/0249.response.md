Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and the range `range(1, n + 1)`. Therefore, the variables that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `j` is 2
   - `nx` is either 'F' or 'S' followed by the character at index `xx[2][1]`
   - `n` is a positive integer

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because the loop condition depends on `j` being less than `n + 1`, and `n` is not modified within the loop.

5. **Maintain the state of other variables**: The values of `i`, `nx`, and `n` remain the same unless explicitly modified within the loop, but since no such modifications are mentioned, they stay as they were.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `nx` is either 'F' or 'S' followed by the character at index `xx[2][1]`, and `n` is a positive integer.**
