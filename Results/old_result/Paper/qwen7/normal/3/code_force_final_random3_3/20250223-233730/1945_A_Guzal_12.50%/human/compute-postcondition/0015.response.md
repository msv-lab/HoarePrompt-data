Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `k` is either `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` or 0, depending on whether the condition `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0` is satisfied. If the condition is true, `k` is 0; otherwise, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`.
