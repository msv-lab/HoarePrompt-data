Output State: **`ans` is a string where the last character is 'a' (assuming s[j] is 0), `s` and `j` retain their original values.**

Explanation: The code `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` appends the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97` to the string `ans`. If `s[j]` is 0, then `chr(0 + 97)` results in the character 'a'. Since no other values are provided for `s` and `j`, they are assumed to retain their original values.
