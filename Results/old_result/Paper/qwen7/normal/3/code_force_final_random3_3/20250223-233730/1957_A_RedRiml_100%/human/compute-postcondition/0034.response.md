Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` which iterates over the list `pl`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: Since `j` is iterating over the list `pl`, the initial value of `j` should be the first element of `pl`.

3. **Determine the state of `pl`**: The list `pl` is defined as a list containing all unique elements of `palka`. For the loop to execute, `pl` must contain at least one element.

4. **Other variables**: The other variables (`shapes`, `t`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `d`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be the first element of `pl`.
- `pl` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the modified state is:

State: **`j` is the first element of `pl`, `pl` must contain at least one element**
