Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces. The first clue is not equal to 1, the third clue is less than or equal to the fifth clue, and either both the third and fifth clues are even numbers or both are odd numbers. Additionally, the third clue is not equal to the fifth clue, and the current value of `clues[3]` is more than 1 unit away from the current value of `clues[5]`. The condition `(clues[3] - 1 >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[5] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))` is true.
