Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer**

The code `k, x, a = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. The initial state of `t` is `t - 1`, which means `t` is already decremented by 1 before this line of code is executed. The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are set to the integers entered by the user.
