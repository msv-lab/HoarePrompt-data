Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is `t-1`, but this does not affect the output of the `print(x - 2)` statement.
- `__name__` is `__main__`, which indicates that the current module is being run as the main program.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `x` is the second integer from the input.
- `y` is the third integer from the input.
- `arr` is a list of integers where each element corresponds to an integer from the input. Specifically, `arr[0]` would be `n`, `arr[1]` would be `x`, and `arr[2]` would be `y`.

The `print(x - 2)` statement will print the value of `x` minus 2.

Output: **x - 2 (where x is the second integer from the input)**
