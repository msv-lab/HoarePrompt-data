Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `c`, which is being assigned values in the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `c`**: Since the loop starts with `c` taking the value of `ord('a')`, we need to ensure that `c` is initialized to `ord('a')`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `c` is less than or equal to `ord('z') + 1`. Therefore, `c` must start at `ord('a')` and increment until it reaches `ord('z') + 1`.

4. **Consider the other variables**: 
   - `decoded`: This can be either a list containing one element `'mapping[char]'` or an empty list. The loop does not directly affect this, so no adjustment is needed for `decoded`.
   - `mapping`: This can be either an empty dictionary or a dictionary mapping all letters from 'a' to 'z' to 'a'. Again, the loop does not directly affect this, so no adjustment is needed for `mapping`.
   - `encoded`: This remains unchanged, so no adjustment is needed for `encoded`.
   - `char`: This is mentioned in the problem statement but is not used in the loop itself. The loop uses `c` instead.

Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `c` to be initialized to `ord('a')`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`c` is `ord('a')`**
