Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are integers. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, and `x` is greater than `bxsfory` * 15 + `y` * 4 where `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y` divided by 2, then `y` is set to twice its value. Otherwise, at least one of `x` or `y` is less than or equal to 0, and if `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, `y` remains unchanged.**
