Output State: **`data` is a list containing the lines from `sys.stdin.read` split by lines, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` retain their original values, `test_cases` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `test_cases`. This does not affect the values of the existing variables (`data`, `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`). Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with the addition of the empty list `test_cases`.
