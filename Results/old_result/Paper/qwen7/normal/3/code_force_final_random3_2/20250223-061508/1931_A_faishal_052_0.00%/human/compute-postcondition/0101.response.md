Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 2
   - `k` is 2
   - `arr` is a sorted list containing the elements [lex, ..., lex, ...]

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(cases):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop runs for `cases` iterations.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` would have been `cases - 1`.
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that the loop processes elements from `arr` and updates `k`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` is incremented at the end of each iteration.
   - After `i = cases - 1`, the next iteration would set `i` to `cases`.
   - `k` is updated within the loop, and since it was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be updated in the next iteration.

5. **Final State:**
   - `j` remains unchanged at 2.
   - `k` will be updated in the next iteration, but we don't know the exact value yet. However, we know it will be incremented.
   - `arr` remains a sorted list containing the elements [lex, ..., lex, ...] because the loop does not modify the list itself, only `k` and `j`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is 2, `k` is 3, `arr` is a sorted list containing the elements [lex, ..., lex, ...]**
