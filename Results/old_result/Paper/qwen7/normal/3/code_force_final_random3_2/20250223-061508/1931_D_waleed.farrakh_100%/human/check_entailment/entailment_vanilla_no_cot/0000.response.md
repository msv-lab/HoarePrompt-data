Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array according to the given problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The `func_2` function reads the input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` to compute the results for each test case.
2. **Beautiful Pair Calculation**:
   - In `func_1`, the program iterates through the array and calculates the remainders when each element is divided by `x` and `y`.
   - It uses a frequency dictionary (`freq`) to keep track of how many times each remainder pair `(rx, ry)` appears.
   - For each element, it checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in the frequency dictionary. If it does, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current element's remainder pair.
3. **Modulo Arithmetic**: The use of modulo arithmetic ensures that negative remainders are handled correctly. Specifically, `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that the remainder is always non-negative.
4. **Output**: The program outputs the count of beautiful pairs for each test case correctly.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the implementation accurately computes the number of beautiful pairs for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
