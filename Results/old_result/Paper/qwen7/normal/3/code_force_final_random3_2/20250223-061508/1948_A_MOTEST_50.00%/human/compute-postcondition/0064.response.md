Output State: **`ans` is increased by `s[x] * 2`, `j` is less than `n // 2 - 1`, `x` is increased by 1, `n` is at least 2, and `j` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` increases the value of `ans` by `s[x] * 2`. The other variables (`j`, `x`, `n`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so their conditions remain the same. Therefore, the updated state includes `ans` being increased by `s[x] * 2`, while `j` is still less than `n // 2 - 1`, `x` is increased by 1, `n` is at least 2, and `j` is incremented by 1.
