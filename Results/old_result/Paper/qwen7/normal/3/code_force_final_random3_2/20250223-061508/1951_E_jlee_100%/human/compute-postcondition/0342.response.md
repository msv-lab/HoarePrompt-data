Output State: **`done` is set to True, `j` is `count + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `done` or `j`, nor does it affect the condition that `n` is greater than 0. It simply breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within.
