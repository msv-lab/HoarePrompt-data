Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `rev_res` as an empty string. The values of `t` and `rev_val` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range, `rev_val` remains an empty list, and `rev_res` is now an empty string.
