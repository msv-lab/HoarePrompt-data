Output State: **`ans` is -1, `i` is 3, `lsum` is 3, `left` is `S[3][0]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[3][1]`, `rsum` is n - 3**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `rsum` to `n - i`. Given that `i` is 3, `rsum` is now `n - 3`. All other variables (`ans`, `i`, `lsum`, `left`, `right`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
