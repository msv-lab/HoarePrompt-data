Output State: **`arr` is an empty list, `k` is incremented, `j` is 2**.

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `arr` is a sorted list containing repeated elements, but since no modification to `arr` is performed in the given code, `arr` remains an empty list. The variable `j` remains unchanged at 2. The variable `k` is incremented but the exact new value is not specified, only that it has been incremented.
