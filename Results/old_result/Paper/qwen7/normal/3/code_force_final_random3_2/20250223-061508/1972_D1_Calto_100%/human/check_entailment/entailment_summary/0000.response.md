Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Function `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. This part is correct and will be used in the solution.
- Function `func_2` is provided but does not correctly solve the problem. According to the output hints, it always returns 10, which is independent of the values of `n` and `m`. This means it does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as stated.

Since `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the given problem, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
