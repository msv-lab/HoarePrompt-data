The function accepts a delimiter parameter and returns a list of integers. It achieves this by first calling another function `func_2()` which presumably returns a string. This string is then split using the provided delimiter, and each resulting substring is converted to an integer. The function does not modify any external variables and solely focuses on processing the output of `func_2()` to produce the final list of integers.
