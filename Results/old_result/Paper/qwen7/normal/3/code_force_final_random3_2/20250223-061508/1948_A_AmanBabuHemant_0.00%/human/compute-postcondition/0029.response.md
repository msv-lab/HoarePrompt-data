Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t > 0`.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 49.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must remain greater than 0. Since `t` is decremented by 1 each iteration (as it is used in `range(t)`), `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to continue.

Given the constraints and the loop condition, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` is decremented by 1 from its previous value, but still remains greater than 0.

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 48, `n` is an input integer.**
