### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key components of the program and verifies their correctness. Let's break down the analysis again to ensure there are no overlooked details.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: The variables `results`, `freq`, and `count` are correctly initialized.
   - **Loop through the array**: The logic for calculating `rx` and `ry` is correct. The use of `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `rx` is non-negative, which is necessary for correct modulo arithmetic.
   - **Frequency Calculation**: The frequency dictionary `freq` is updated correctly, and the count of beautiful pairs is calculated accurately by checking existing entries in `freq`.
   - **Return Results**: The function returns the list of counts for each test case.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Reading Input**: The use of `sys.stdin.read` is efficient for reading large inputs.
   - **Processing Test Cases**: The function correctly organizes the test cases and passes them to `func_1`.

3. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The conditions for a pair being "beautiful" are correctly checked using the modulo operations.
   - The overall logic for finding beautiful pairs is sound and follows the problem description.

Given the detailed analysis and the verification of each component, the original assessment is accurate.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array.

**Final: True**
