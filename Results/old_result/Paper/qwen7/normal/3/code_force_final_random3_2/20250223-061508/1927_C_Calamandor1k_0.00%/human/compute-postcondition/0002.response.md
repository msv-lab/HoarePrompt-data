Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers separated by spaces from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, retaining its initial state as an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
