Based on the initial state described:

- `x` is the minimum value in `inp`.
- `y` is the second minimum value in `inp` if there are at least two distinct elements in `inp`.
- `ans` is the count of unique minimum values in `inp` if all elements are the same, otherwise it is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than `y`.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`.

To determine the exact value of `ans`, we need to consider two cases:

1. **All elements in `inp` are the same**: In this case, `x` would be the same as every other element in `inp`, so `ans` would be the count of unique minimum values, which is 1.
2. **There are at least two distinct elements in `inp`**: Here, `y` would be the second smallest value, and `ans` would be the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than `y`.

Since the exact content of `inp` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, `ans` will be either 1 (if all elements are the same) or the count of elements greater than `y` (if there are at least two distinct elements).

Output: **ans (where ans is 1 if all elements in inp are the same, otherwise it is the count of elements in inp that are greater than y)**
