Output State: **`i` is the length of `pathb` + 1, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` computed during the loop iterations, `curr` is the last computed value of `curr` within the loop, `resb` is the same as the previous value if it was updated or the original value otherwise, `n` is now the integer value of the first element of the input split, `k` is now the integer value of the second element of the input split, `pb` is now the integer value of the third element of the input split, `ps` is now the integer value of the fourth element of the input split.**

Explanation: The code snippet converts the strings `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` into integers using the `int()` function. This changes the types of these variables from strings to integers, but does not affect their values, which are now their integer representations of the original split elements. All other variables (`i`, `pres`, `ress`, `curr`, `resb`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
