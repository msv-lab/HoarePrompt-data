Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for item in arr[1:]` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `item` and `arr`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `arr` is `[i+2, i+1]`
   - `item` is `i+2`
   - `res` is `input()`
   - `mini` is `i+2` if `res` equals `'>'`. Otherwise, the values of `arr`, `item`, `res`, and `mini` remain unchanged.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop iterates over `arr[1:]`, which means it starts from the second element of `arr`.
   - In the previous iteration, `item` was `i+2`, which is the first element of `arr[1:]`.
   - For the next iteration, `item` will be the second element of `arr[1:]`, which is `i+1`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - `arr` remains the same: `[i+2, i+1]`.
   - `item` changes to `i+1`.
   - `res` remains as `input()` because it is not modified within the loop head.
   - `mini` remains `i+2` if `res` equals `'>'`. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`arr` is `[i+2, i+1]`, `item` is `i+1`, `res` is `input()`, `mini` is `i+2` if `res` equals `'>'`. If `res` does not equal `'>'`, then the values of `arr`, `item`, `res`, and `mini` remain unchanged.**
