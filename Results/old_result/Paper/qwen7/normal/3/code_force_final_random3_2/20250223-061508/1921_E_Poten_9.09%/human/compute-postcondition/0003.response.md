Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

The code reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer, storing the resulting list in the variable `clues`. The values of `test_cases` and `answers` remain unchanged, and `i` is still set to 0.
