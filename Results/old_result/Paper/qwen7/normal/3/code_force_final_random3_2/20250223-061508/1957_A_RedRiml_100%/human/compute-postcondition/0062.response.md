Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, and `d.get(i)` is now `d.get(i) + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d.get(i)` by 1. Since `d.get(i)` was not `None` in the initial state, it means `d.get(i)` had some integer value before the operation. After executing the code, `d.get(i)` is now one more than its previous value. The list `palka` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
