Reasoning:
- The annotated program correctly follows the logic required to solve the problem.
- It initializes necessary variables and reads the input as specified.
- It constructs the paths for Bodya and Sasha using the given permutation and updates their scores accordingly.
- The program then calculates the maximum possible scores for both players based on the given number of turns \( k \).
- Finally, it compares the scores and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

The code logic matches the problem statement and the provided example. There are no logical errors or omissions that would cause incorrect results.

Correctness: **True**
