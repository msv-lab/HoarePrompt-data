You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of encoded is at most 2 * 10^5. The string encoded is the result of encoding some original string s using the described algorithm.
def func_1(encoded):
    mapping = {}
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        if char in mapping:
            decoded.append(mapping[char])
        else:
            for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                    mapping[chr(c)] = char
                    break
            decoded.append(chr(c))
        
    #State: Output State: `decoded` is a list containing all characters from the `encoded` string, where each character is mapped according to the rules defined in the loop. `mapping` is a dictionary that contains all lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z') as keys, each mapped to the character 'a'. The `encoded` string remains unchanged.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, every character in the `encoded` string has been processed. If a character was already present in the `mapping` dictionary, its corresponding value (as per the dictionary) is appended to `decoded`. If a character was not in `mapping`, the loop finds the first unused lowercase letter (starting from 'a') and maps it to the current character, then appends this letter to `decoded`. By the end of the loop, `decoded` will contain a sequence of characters based on these mappings, and `mapping` will have all possible lowercase letters mapped to 'a'.
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns a string composed of characters derived from the `encoded` string, where each character is mapped to 'a' according to the rules defined in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `encoded`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of `encoded` is at most 2 * 10^5. Based on the rules defined in the loop, the function returns a string where each character in `encoded` is mapped to 'a'.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string composed of characters derived from the `encoded` string, where each character is mapped to 'a' according to the rules defined in the loop.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
