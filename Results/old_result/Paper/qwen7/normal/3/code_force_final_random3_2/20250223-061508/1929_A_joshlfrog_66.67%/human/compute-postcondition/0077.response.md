Output State: **`i` is `l-1`, `e` is 2, `l` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is equal to `nums[i]`, `y` is now `nums[i]`, and `nums[i]` is less than `y`.**

Explanation: The code `y = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `y`. Since `x` was previously set to `nums[i]`, `x` remains unchanged. All other variables (`i`, `e`, `l`, `y`) are updated accordingly.
