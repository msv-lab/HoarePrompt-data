Based on the initial state provided:

- `[*open(0)]` is a list with at least 2 elements.
- The third element of this list is a string with at least two integers separated by spaces, indicating that the loop runs `x - k + 3` times.
- `i` is `x - k + 2`.
- `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` three times within each iteration of the loop.
- The condition `a >= z` is true.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('YES')
```

The print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`. There are no variables or objects from the initial state that need to be evaluated or substituted into the print statement.

Output: **YES**
