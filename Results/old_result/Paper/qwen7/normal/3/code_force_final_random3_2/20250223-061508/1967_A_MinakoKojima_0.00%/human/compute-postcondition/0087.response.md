Output State: **`ans` is multiplied by `a[1] - a[0] * (a[3] - a[2]) * (a[4] - a[3])`, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 1**.

Explanation: The code multiplies `ans` by the expression `a[i] - a[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 4, the expression becomes `a[4] - a[3]`. Therefore, `ans` is updated to its current value multiplied by `a[4] - a[3]`. The other variables (`i` and `n`) remain unchanged, and the precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
