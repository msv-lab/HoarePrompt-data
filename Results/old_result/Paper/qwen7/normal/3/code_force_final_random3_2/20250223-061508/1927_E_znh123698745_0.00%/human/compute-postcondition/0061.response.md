Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `a` is a list with two elements: `a[0]` is `n` and `a[-1]` is `1`.
- `array` remains unchanged.
- `answer` is a list containing `n` elements, with elements alternating between the last remaining element of `array` (as `a[-1]` decreases) and the first element of `array` (as `a[0]` increases).

Given these conditions, let's construct the `answer` list step-by-step:

1. Initially, `a[0]` is `n` and `a[-1]` is `1`.
2. As `a[-1]` decreases from `1` to `1`, it alternates with the first element of `array`.
3. Since `a[0]` starts at `n` and increases, it alternates with the last element of `array`.

Assuming `array` is a list of `n` elements, the `answer` list will be constructed as follows:
- The first element of `answer` will be the first element of `array`.
- The second element of `answer` will be the last element of `array`.
- This pattern continues until `a[-1]` reaches `1`.

Thus, the `answer` list will contain elements alternating between the first and last elements of `array`.

Output: **[first element of array, last element of array, first element of array, last element of array, ...]**
