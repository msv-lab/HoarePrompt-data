Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `s` is the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `e` is the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `arr` is an updated list, `nums` is a list with at least `N + 1` elements, `l` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split, `eli` is the updated index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`, `s` is now the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `e` is now the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index.**

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts because the variables and their relationships do not change regardless of whether the condition `e >= r` is true or false.
