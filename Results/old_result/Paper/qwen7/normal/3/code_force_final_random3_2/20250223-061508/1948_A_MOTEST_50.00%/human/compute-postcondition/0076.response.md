Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1, `i` is 2 if `t` was 1 or 4 if `t` was 3, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is the string `s[0]` repeated `n` times, `x` is `n // 2`, `j` is `n // 2` if `n` is even; otherwise, if `n` equals 1, `ans` is the string `s[0]` repeated `n` times plus 6 times the value of `s[x]`, `x` is increased by 3, `j` is increased by 2, if `n` is at least 2, `ans` is increased by `s[x] * 2` for each iteration of the loop, `x` is increased by 2 for each iteration, and `j` is less than `n // 2 - 1` when the loop ends, and if `n` is even, `x` is 7 and `j` is 3 after the loop, otherwise, `ans` is 's[4]s[4]' + 's[4]' * 6.
