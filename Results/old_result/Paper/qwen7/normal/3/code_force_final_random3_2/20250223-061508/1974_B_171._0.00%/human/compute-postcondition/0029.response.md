Output State: **`c` is 97, `mapping` is a dictionary with key 'a' and value `char`, the character corresponding to `c` is not in the values of `mapping`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the character corresponding to `c` (which is 'a' since `c` is `ord('a')`) to the value `char`. It then adds a key-value pair to the dictionary `mapping` where the key is the character 'a' and the value is `char`. The initial conditions that `c` is `ord('a')` and the character corresponding to `c` is not in the values of `mapping` remain true after the code execution.
