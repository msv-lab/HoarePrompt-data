Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of elements in the list `nums` and `k` is an integer. It initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with zeros. For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, it sets `nums[i]` to a value derived from the bit length of `k`, specifically `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, and then decreases `k` by this value. After the loop, it adjusts the last element of `nums` by adding any remaining value of `k`. Finally, it returns the list `nums`. The returned list contains the sequence of values assigned to it during the iterations, with zeros in the positions not affected by the loop, and the last element set to zero.**
