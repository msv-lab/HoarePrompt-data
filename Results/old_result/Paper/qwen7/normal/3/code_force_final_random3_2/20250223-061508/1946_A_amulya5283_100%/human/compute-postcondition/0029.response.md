Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t > 0`.

2. **Determine the relevant variables**: The relevant variable for the loop condition is `t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.

4. **Loop behavior**:
   - If `t` is greater than 0, the loop will execute.
   - If `t` is not greater than 0 (i.e., `t` is 0), the loop will terminate.

5. **Adjusting the state**:
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since `t` is currently greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, we need to ensure that `t` remains greater than 0 for the next iteration.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`. We need to ensure that `t` remains greater than 0 for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must remain greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must remain greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers**.
