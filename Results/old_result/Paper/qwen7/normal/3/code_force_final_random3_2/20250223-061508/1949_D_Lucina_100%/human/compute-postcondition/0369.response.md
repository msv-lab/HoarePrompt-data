Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 3, `j` is 3, and `nx` is either 'x' + `xx[4][2]`, 'S' + `xx[4][2]`, 'F' + `xx[4][2]`, 'xS' + `xx[4][2]`, 'FS' + `xx[2]`, 'SF' + `xx[4][2]`, or 'xF' + `xx[4][2]`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`. Given that `i` is 4 and `j` is 3, `j - 1` equals 2. Therefore, `nx` is updated by appending `xx[4][2]` to its current value. Since the exact value of `xx[4][2]` is not provided, we express the new value of `nx` in terms of its original possible values combined with `xx[4][2]`.
