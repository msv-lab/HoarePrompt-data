Output State: **`resb` is the maximum of its current value and `preb + pathb[0] * k`, `i` is 1, `preb` is increased by `pathb[0]`**.

Explanation: The line `resb = max(resb, curr)` updates `resb` to be the maximum of its current value and `curr`. Given that `curr` is defined as `preb + pathb[0] * k`, `resb` will now hold the maximum value between its original value and `preb + pathb[0] * k`. The variables `i` and `preb` are updated as per their previous definitions, with `i` remaining 1 and `preb` being increased by `pathb[0]`.
