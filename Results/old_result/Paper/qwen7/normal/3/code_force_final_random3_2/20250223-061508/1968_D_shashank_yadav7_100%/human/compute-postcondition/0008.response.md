Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `b` is the integer from the input minus 1, `s` is a string from the input with 1 subtracted from its length, `p` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `a` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `sp` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `s` (inclusive) and extending to the end of the list `a`, `bp` is the element at index `b` in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the element at index `b` in list `a` to the variable `bp`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
