Output State: **`preb` is 0 + `pathb[0]`, `pres` is 0, `pathb` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `curr` is `pathb[0] * k`.**

Explanation: The code `preb += pathb[i]` increments `preb` by the value of `pathb[i]`. Given that `i` is 0, `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[0]`, which is `0 + pathb[0]`. The values of `pres`, `pathb`, `i`, and `curr` remain unchanged.
