Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, which is 3.
   - `x` must be at least 2.
   - `y` is 2.
   - `gcd_val` is 1.
   - `best_y` is 2.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `y` starting from `x - 1` down to 1 (exclusive).
   - In the previous iteration, `y` was 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `y` must be decremented by 1, making it 1.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `x` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.
   - `y` is decremented by 1, so `y` becomes 1.
   - `max_sum` and `current_sum` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop head.
   - `gcd_val` and `best_y` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop head.

5. **Final States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `max_sum` is still 3.
   - `x` must still be at least 2.
   - `y` is now 1.
   - `gcd_val` is still 1.
   - `best_y` is still 2.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`max_sum` is 3, `x` must be at least 2, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is 1, `best_y` is 2**
