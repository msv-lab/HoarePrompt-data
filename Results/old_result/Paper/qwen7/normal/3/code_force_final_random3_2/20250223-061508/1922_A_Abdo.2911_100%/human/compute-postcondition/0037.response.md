Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

3. **Current Iteration**: Since `i` is currently 1, the loop condition `i < n` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, so `i` will become 2.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `n` must still be greater than 0.

5. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` will be 2 in the next iteration, `n` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 2

So, the final state is:
**`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
