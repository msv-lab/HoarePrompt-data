Output State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` is `n - 1`, `i` must be within the range `[1, n-1]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `pans` is a list containing the elements `n - 1`, `n - 1`, `n`, `s` is the string `'>', n` is the input integer.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It only ensures that any buffered data in the standard output buffer is written out immediately. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
