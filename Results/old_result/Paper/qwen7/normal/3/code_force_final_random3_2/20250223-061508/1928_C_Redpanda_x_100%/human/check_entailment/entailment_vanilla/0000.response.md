Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find how many values of \( k \) satisfy the conditions given the position \( n \) and the number \( x \) received by Vasya.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) must fit into the repeating pattern.
   - The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and within one cycle, the numbers are distributed in a specific way.

3. **Given Functions**:
   - `func_1` and `generate` are defined but not used in the main logic of solving the problem.
   - These functions seem to deal with prime factorization and generating factors, which are not directly relevant to solving the current problem.

4. **Relevant Logic**:
   - The core logic needed is to determine the possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) fit into the repeating pattern.
   - We need to check if \( n \) and \( x \) can be part of the sequence generated by the settling pattern.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The provided functions do not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem.
   - The problem requires understanding the periodicity and distribution of numbers in the settling pattern, which is not addressed by the given functions.

### Conclusion

The given program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem correctly. The functions `func_1` and `generate` are not used in the context of solving the problem and do not provide the required functionality.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
