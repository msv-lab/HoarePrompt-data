Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 3, `s` is an input string, `pans` is a list containing the value of `i` from the previous iteration and the current value of `i`, which is `n + 1`. If `s` equals '=', the function does not change the values of `i`, `n`, `s`, or `pans`; otherwise, no specific changes are made to these variables as there is no else part.
