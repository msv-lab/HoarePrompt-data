The function accepts two parameters: `t` (a positive integer representing the number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples). Each tuple contains an integer `n` (the length of the array `a`) followed by `n` integers representing the array `a`. For each test case, the function sorts the array, finds the median, creates a heap from the elements greater than or equal to the median, and performs a series of operations where it increments the smallest element in the heap until it exceeds the median. After processing all test cases, the function returns a list where each element is 3, indicating that exactly 3 operations were performed for each test case.
