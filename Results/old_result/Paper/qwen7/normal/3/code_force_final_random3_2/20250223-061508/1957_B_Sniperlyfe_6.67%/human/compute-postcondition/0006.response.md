Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `k` is `k - 2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`**.

Explanation: The initial state is `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `nums[i]` is `2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. The code `k -= nums[i]` subtracts `nums[i]` from `k`. Since `nums[i]` is `2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, `k` is updated to `k - (2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`. Therefore, `k` is now `k - 2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
