Output State: The loop will continue to execute for as many times as there are lines in the input file (excluding the first line). For each iteration, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` will be updated based on the conditions provided in the loop body. Specifically:

- If `x < k - 1` and `a >= x + 1`, `print('YES')` will be executed, and `a` will remain unchanged.
- If `x < k - 1` and `a < x + 1`, `print('NO')` will be executed, and `a` will be set to `z`, where `z` is calculated as described in the loop.
- If `x == k - 1` and `a >= x + 2`, `print('YES')` will be executed, and `a` will remain unchanged.
- If `x == k - 1` and `a < x + 2`, `print('NO')` will be executed, and `a` will be set to `z`, where `z` is calculated as described in the loop.
- If `x > k - 1`, the loop will calculate `z` using the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x - k + 3` iterations, and then check if `a >= z`. Depending on the result, it will either print 'YES' or 'NO' and update `a` accordingly.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the final state will be a list `[*open(0)]` containing the original input lines followed by the results of each iteration ('YES' or 'NO'), and the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` will reflect the last state they were in before the loop terminated.
