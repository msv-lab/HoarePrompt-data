Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing characters from `string`, `n` is the length of list `s`, `x` is the first character of list `s`, and `done` is False. We continue the loop or statement we were inside.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed directly to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables and the loop continues, all the variables retain their previous states.
