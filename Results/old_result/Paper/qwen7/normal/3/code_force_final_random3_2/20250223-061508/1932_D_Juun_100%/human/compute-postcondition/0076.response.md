Let's break down the given code snippet and initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State**: `trumps` is not an empty list.
2. **Code Snippet**: 
   ```python
   print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **`trumps.pop()`**: This method removes and returns the last element from the `trumps` list. Let's denote the last element of `trumps` as `last_element_trumps`.

2. **`trump`**: This variable is not defined in the initial state, so it will remain as `trump` in the output.

3. **First Part of the Print Statement**: 
   - The first part of the print statement is `{trumps.pop()}{trump}`.
   - After the first `pop`, the last element (`last_element_trumps`) is removed from `trumps`.
   - The next element (second to last) of `trumps` is now considered as `last_element_trumps`.
   - So, `{trumps.pop()}{trump}` becomes `{last_element_trumps}{trump}`.

4. **Second Part of the Print Statement**: 
   - The second part of the print statement is `{trumps.pop()}{trump}`.
   - After the second `pop`, the second to last element (`last_element_trumps`) is removed from `trumps`.
   - The first element of `trumps` is now considered as `last_element_trumps`.
   - So, `{trumps.pop()}{trump}` becomes `{last_element_trumps}{trump}`.

### Final Output:
Combining both parts, the final output of the print statement will be:
- The last element of `trumps` (denoted as `last_element_trumps`) followed by `trump`, then another space, and finally the second to last element of `trumps` (also denoted as `last_element_trumps`) followed by `trump`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **last_element_trumpstrump last_element_trumpstrump**
