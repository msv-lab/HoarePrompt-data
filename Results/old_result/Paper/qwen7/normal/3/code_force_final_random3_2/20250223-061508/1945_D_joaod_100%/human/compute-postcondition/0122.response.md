Output State: **`total` is 0, `na_frente` is `na_frente - 2`, `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the subsequent input split and converted to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the current input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `total` to 0. This does not affect the values of `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, or `custo_pra_passar_b`. The initial state of these variables is preserved, and only `total` is updated to 0.
