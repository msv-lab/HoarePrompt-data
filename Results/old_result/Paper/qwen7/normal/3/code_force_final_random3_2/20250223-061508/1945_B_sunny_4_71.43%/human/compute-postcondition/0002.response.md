Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `m` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. Since the actual values are not specified in the initial state, the output state simply states that these variables now hold the integers entered by the user.
