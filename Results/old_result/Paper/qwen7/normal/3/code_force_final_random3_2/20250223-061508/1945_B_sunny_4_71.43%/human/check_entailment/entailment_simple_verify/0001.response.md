### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the problem statement carefully.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
- Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes and are visible for `m + 1` minutes.
- Fireworks from the second installation are launched every `b` minutes and are visible for `m + 1` minutes.
- Both installations are turned on simultaneously.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        A = int(m / a) + 1
        B = int(m / b) + 1
        print(A + B)
```

#### Annotated Code:
- The program reads `t`, the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `a`, `b`, and `m`.
- It calculates `A` as `int(m / a) + 1`, representing the number of times the first installation launches fireworks within the visibility period `m`.
- It calculates `B` as `int(m / b) + 1`, representing the number of times the second installation launches fireworks within the visibility period `m`.
- It prints `A + B`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Visibility Period Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of launches by each installation within the visibility period `m`.
   - `A = int(m / a) + 1` gives the number of times the first installation launches fireworks within `m` minutes.
   - `B = int(m / b) + 1` gives the number of times the second installation launches fireworks within `m` minutes.

2. **Simultaneous Launches:**
   - The program assumes that each launch by one installation does not overlap with any launch by the other installation within the same visibility period.
   - However, the program does not account for the exact overlap of visibility periods, which can lead to an overestimation of the number of simultaneous fireworks.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to understand how often both installations launch fireworks at the same time.
   - The correct approach would involve calculating the LCM and determining the number of simultaneous launches within the visibility period.

#### Example:
- For the input `6 7 4`:
  - First installation launches every 6 minutes.
  - Second installation launches every 7 minutes.
  - Visibility period is 4 minutes.
  - The program calculates:
    - `A = int(4 / 6) + 1 = 1`
    - `B = int(4 / 7) + 1 = 1`
  - Total fireworks seen = `A + B = 2`
  - However, the actual maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is 2, as shown in the example.

#### Conclusion:
- The program correctly calculates the number of launches within the visibility period but does not account for the exact overlap of visibility periods.
- The program does not overestimate the number of simultaneous fireworks, as it only counts the launches within the visibility period.

### Final Evaluation:
The given program does not overestimate the number of simultaneous fireworks and correctly calculates the number of launches within the visibility period. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final: True**
