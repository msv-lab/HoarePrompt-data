Output State: **`ops` is a list containing either one or two tuples., `p1` contains the elements of `vx` except the second last one., `p2` is an empty list., `v1` is the second last element of the updated `vx` minus 2., `v2` is the second last element of the updated `vx`, `vx` has had its second last element removed., `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)`, and the second element of the returned tuple from `q(0)` is discarded.**

This means that the function `q(0)` was called, and it returned a tuple. The first element of this tuple was assigned to `v3`, while the second element was ignored (denoted by `_`). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
