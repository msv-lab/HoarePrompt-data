Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is `i`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing `i`, `s` is the string '<'**.

Explanation: The code snippet `pans = [i]` creates a list with the value of `i` and assigns it to the variable `pans`. The values of `mak2`, `mak`, `i`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state.
