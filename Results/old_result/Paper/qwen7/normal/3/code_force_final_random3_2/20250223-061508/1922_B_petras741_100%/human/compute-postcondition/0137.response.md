Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `eta` includes `j` if `q[j]` was greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `eta` is appended with `j`.**

Explanation: The code `eta.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `eta`. Since `j` is already `j + 1`, the new value of `j` remains `j + 1`. The condition for including `j` in `eta` (if `q[j]` was greater than 0) remains unchanged. The variable `n` is not affected by this operation.
