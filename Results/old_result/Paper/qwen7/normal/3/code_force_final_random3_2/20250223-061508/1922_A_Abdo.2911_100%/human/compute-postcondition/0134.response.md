Output State: **`possible` is `True`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0, and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`**.

The code sets `possible` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
