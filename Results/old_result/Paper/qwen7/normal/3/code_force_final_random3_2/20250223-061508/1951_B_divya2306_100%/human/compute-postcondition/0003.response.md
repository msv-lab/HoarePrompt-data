Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
   - `n` is given as an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`. Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - `i` is set to 0 by default when the loop starts.

Given the initial state where `wins` is 0, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` are defined but not directly relevant to the loop execution, we only need to focus on `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
