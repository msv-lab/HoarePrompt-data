Output State: **`d` is a dictionary, `i` is the next element in the list `palka`, `pl` is updated with the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. The dictionary `d` and the value of `i` remain unchanged from their previous states. The list `pl` is updated to include the new value of `i`.
