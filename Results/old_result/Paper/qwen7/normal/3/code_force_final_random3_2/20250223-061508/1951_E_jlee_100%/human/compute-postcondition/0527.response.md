Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` is `True`.
- `count` is equal to `j`, where `j` is such that the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`.

Given this, let's break down the `print` statement:

```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

Here, `string[:j - 1]` represents the substring from the start of the string up to but not including the character at index `j - 1`. 

`string[j - 1:]` represents the substring starting from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of the string.

Since `j` is the index where the characters do not match, `string[:j - 1]` will include all characters from the start of the string up to the character just before the mismatch, and `string[j - 1:]` will include all characters from the mismatched character to the end of the string.

Therefore, the output will be the two substrings separated by a space.

Output: **string[:j - 1] string[j - 1:]**
