Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `t` must be at least 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string from the user, `count` is the number of times '1' appears in `a`. If `a[a.index('1') + 1]` is not '1', the postcondition remains as is. If `a[a.index('1') + 1]` is '1', the postcondition also remains unchanged.**
