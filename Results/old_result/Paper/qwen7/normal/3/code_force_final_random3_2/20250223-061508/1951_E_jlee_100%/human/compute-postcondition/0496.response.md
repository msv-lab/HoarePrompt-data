Output State: **`done` is `True`, `count` is equal to `j`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `done` or `count`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within, which in this case is implied to be a loop or conditional statement that was not explicitly shown in the code snippet. Therefore, the values of `done` and `count` remain unchanged.
