- The logic in `func_1` is sound. It correctly identifies divisors and perfect squares that could represent valid `k` values.
  - The use of set to remove duplicates before calculating the length ensures the output is unique.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
