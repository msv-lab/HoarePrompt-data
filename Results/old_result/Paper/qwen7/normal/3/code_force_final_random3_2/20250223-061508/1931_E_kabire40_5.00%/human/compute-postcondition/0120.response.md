Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variable `x` from the list `operational_list`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `operational_list`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `operational_list` contains at least one element.
   - `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of `x`.
   - If `len(str(x_rev))` equals `len(x)`, then `rev_res` is incremented by `x`.
   - Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as there are elements in `operational_list`, the next element `x` from `operational_list` will be processed.
   - `x_rev` will be the integer representation of the reversed string of this new `x`.
   - Depending on the condition (`len(str(x_rev)) == len(x)`), either `rev_res` will be updated or `rev_val` will be updated.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - `operational_list` will now contain at least one fewer element (since one element has been processed).
   - `x` will be the next element in `operational_list`.
   - `x_rev` will be the integer representation of the reversed string of this new `x`.
   - The conditions for updating `rev_res` or `rev_val` will be based on the new `x`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `operational_list` contains at least one fewer element.
- `x` is the next element in `operational_list`.
- `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of this new `x`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`operational_list` contains at least one fewer element, `x` is the next element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of `x`**
