Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[v]` now contains all integers `u` that are connected to `v` through the edges added during the loop iterations, `ends` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `ends`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `u`, `v`, or `nodes`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states. The only new information is that `ends` is now an empty list.
