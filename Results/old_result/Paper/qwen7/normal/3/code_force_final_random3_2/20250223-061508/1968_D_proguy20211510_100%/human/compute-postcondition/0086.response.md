Output State: **`i` is length_of_pathb + 1, `preb` is 0, `pathb` is a list, `len(paths)` is a constant, `pres` is pres + paths[length_of_pathb], `curr` is pres + paths[length_of_pathb] * (k - (length_of_pathb + 1)), `ress` is the maximum of ress and curr, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or if statement that was being executed. The values of the variables `i`, `preb`, `pathb`, `len(paths)`, `pres`, `curr`, and `ress` remain unchanged after the `break` statement is executed.
