You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 9\). For each test case, it prints the pair \(x, y\) if \(x < y\), otherwise it prints \(y, x\). After processing all test cases, it ensures that the output respects the given constraints and conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires processing multiple test cases. For each test case, we need to find the minimum and maximum of two integers \(x\) and \(y\), and then print them in the specified order.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads an integer `x` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over these test cases using a loop that runs `x` times.
   - Inside the loop, it reads two space-separated integers \(x\) and \(y\) from input.
   - It checks if \(x < y\). If true, it prints \(x\) followed by \(y\). Otherwise, it prints \(y\) followed by \(x\).

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic inside the loop correctly identifies the minimum and maximum values and prints them in the required format.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the variable names. The same variable `x` is used to store both the number of test cases and one of the integers in each test case. This can lead to confusion and potential bugs, but it does not affect the correctness of the logic for determining the minimum and maximum values.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - Let's verify with the provided example:
     - For the first test case: `1 9`, the program will print `1 9` because 1 is less than 9.
     - For the second test case: `8 4`, the program will print `4 8` because 4 is less than 8.
     - And so on for all the test cases.

Given the above analysis, the program logic is correct and follows the requirements of the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
