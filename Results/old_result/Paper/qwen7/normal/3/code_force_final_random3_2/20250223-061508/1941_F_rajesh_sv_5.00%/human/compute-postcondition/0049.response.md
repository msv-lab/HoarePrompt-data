Postcondition: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F` and `l` must be less than `h`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `mid` remains unchanged and the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is set to `mid`, and the condition becomes `mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum`.**
