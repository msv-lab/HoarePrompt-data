Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is the index of the smallest item in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`, `h` is the index of the largest item in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - f`, and `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` to `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f`, respectively. These assignments do not affect the values of `l`, `h`, or `mid`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` updated according to their new definitions.
