Output State: `vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `MOD` is 1000000007; `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original `n` string to an integer; `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original `k` string to an integer; `pb` remains unchanged; `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original `ps` string to an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting another input string using `map(int, input().split())`; `pathb` is a list containing the elements `[a[pb - 1], a[pb - 1], ..., a[pb - 1]]` (where the length of the list equals the number of iterations the loop executed); `paths` is an empty list.

This output state describes the final configuration of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The loop continues to append the value of `a[pb - 1]` to the list `pathb` until it encounters a previously visited node (i.e., `vis[pb - 1] == 1`). Since the loop breaks when this condition is met, `pathb` will contain the sequence of nodes traversed before a cycle is detected.
