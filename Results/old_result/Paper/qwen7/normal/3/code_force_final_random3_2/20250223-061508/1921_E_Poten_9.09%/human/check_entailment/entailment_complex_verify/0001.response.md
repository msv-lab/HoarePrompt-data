### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement and the provided annotations.

#### Initial Conditions Check:
1. **Reading Input and Setting Up:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It initializes the test cases and splits the input into individual variables for each test case.

2. **Initial Conditions Check:**
   - The program checks if Alice's position (`x_a`) is greater than Bob's position (`x_b`) or if Alice is already in the last row (`x_a == h`).
   - If either condition is true, it directly appends "Draw" to the answers list. This part is correct because if Alice is in the last row, she cannot move further down, and if Alice's position is greater than Bob's, Bob cannot catch Alice.

#### Parity Check:
3. **Parity Check:**
   - The program checks the parity (even or odd) of Alice's and Bob's positions.
   - If both positions have the same parity, it further checks the relative positions of Alice and Bob.
   - If Alice is to the left of Bob, it checks the distance between them and whether Alice can move to Bob's position before Bob can reach Alice.
   - If Alice is to the right of Bob, similar checks are performed.
   - If Alice and Bob have different parities, it directly assigns "Alice" as the winner. This is correct because Alice can always force a win by moving diagonally when the parities differ.

#### Detailed Checks for Specific Cases:
4. **Detailed Checks for Specific Cases:**
   - The program handles specific cases where Alice and Bob are close to each other and checks if Alice can force a win or if the game results in a draw.
   - These checks involve comparing distances and ensuring that Alice can always move to Bob's position before Bob can reach Alice, considering the constraints of the board.

However, upon closer inspection, there are several issues with the logic and the handling of certain cases:

- **Incorrect Handling of Parity and Position Comparisons:**
  - The program incorrectly handles the detailed checks for specific cases. For example, it does not properly account for the diagonal movements and the relative positions of Alice and Bob in a way that ensures the optimal strategy is followed.
  - The program does not correctly handle the scenario where Alice and Bob are in positions that allow Bob to block Alice's path to Bob's position.

- **Incorrect Assumptions:**
  - The program assumes that Alice can always force a win by moving diagonally when the parities differ, but this is not always true. There are scenarios where Bob can block Alice's path effectively.

- **Missing Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle all edge cases, such as when Alice and Bob are very close to each other and the board size is small, leading to incorrect outcomes.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the game outcome based on the problem statement.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

The program contains logical errors and does not correctly handle all cases, leading to incorrect outcomes in some scenarios.
