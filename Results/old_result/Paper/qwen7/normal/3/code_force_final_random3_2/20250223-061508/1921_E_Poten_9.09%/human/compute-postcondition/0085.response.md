Postcondition: **`test_cases` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `answers` is either ['Draw'] or ['Alice'], `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, the first element of `clues` is not 1, the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, and the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` is greater than 1.**

This postcondition summarizes that after the if-else block executes, `test_cases` remains within the specified range, `answers` will be either a list containing 'Draw' or a list containing 'Alice', `i` remains 0, and `clues` maintains its original properties as described.
