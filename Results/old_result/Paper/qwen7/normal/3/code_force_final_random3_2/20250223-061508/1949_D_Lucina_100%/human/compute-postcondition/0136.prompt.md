Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element has been incremented based on the occurrences of 'F' across all input strings stored in `xx`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element has been incremented based on the occurrences of 'S' across all input strings stored in `xx`, `xx` contains all the input strings provided during the loop executions, `sa` is an empty list, `x` remains unchanged with its value assigned from `input()` for each iteration, `sb` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if a[i] > 0 and b[i] == 0:
        sa.append(i)
    if b[i] > 0 and a[i] == 0:
        sb.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `a[i]` is 0, `b[i]` is greater than 0, `sa` is a list containing the value 1, `sb` is a list containing the value 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `a[2]` is yet to be determined, `b[2]` is 0, `sa` is a list containing the values 1 and 2, `sb` is a list containing the values 1 and 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3, `a[2]` is yet to be determined, `b[2]` is 0, `sa` is a list containing the values 1, 2, and 3, `sb` is a list containing the values 1, 2, and 3. If `b[3]` is greater than 0 and `a[3]` is 0, then `sa` and `sb` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `sa` and `sb` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
