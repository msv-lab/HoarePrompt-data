Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[i]`**.

This means that the variable `i` remains unchanged at 0, while `n` is set to the first element of the tuple `test_cases[i]`, and `arr` is set to the second element of the same tuple. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
