Output State: **`trumps` is a list containing all ranks of cards that match the trump suit except for the last two elements, `answers` is a list containing all valid answers generated during the loop execution with the new element added which is a string formatted as f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}', `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value must be something other than `None`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the `answers` list. This new element is a string formatted as `f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`. After appending, the `trumps` list loses its last element because `trumps.pop()` removes and returns the last element from the `trumps` list. However, since the code does not assign the returned value anywhere, the `trumps` list itself is updated. The `suits` dictionary remains unchanged.
