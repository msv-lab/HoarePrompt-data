You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        k = 0
        if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            k += a + (b + c) // 3
            if (b + c) % 3 != 0:
                k += 1
            print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple sets of three non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) representing the counts of introverts, extroverts, and universals respectively. For each set, it calculates a value based on specific conditions involving \(b\) and \(c\). If certain conditions are met, it increments a cumulative count \(k\). Finally, it prints the accumulated value \(k\) for each set of inputs.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - A variable `k` is initialized to 0, which will store the number of tents required.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0` checks if it's impossible to accommodate the participants:
     - `b % 3 != 0` means there is at least one extrovert who cannot find a suitable tent because they need a full group of 3.
     - `c < 3` means there are fewer than 3 universals, making it impossible to form a full group of 3 with extroverts.
     - `(b + c) % 3 != 0` ensures that even with the remaining universals, the total number of people (extroverts + universals) cannot form complete groups of 3.
   - If this condition is true, the program prints `-1` indicating it's impossible to accommodate everyone.

4. **Tent Calculation**:
   - `k += a + (b + c) // 3` adds the number of tents required for introverts (`a`) and the number of full groups of 3 people from extroverts and universals (`(b + c) // 3`).
   - If there are leftover people (i.e., `(b + c) % 3 != 0`), an additional tent is needed, so `k += 1`.

5. **Output**:
   - The final value of `k` is printed, which represents the minimum number of tents required.

### Testing the Logic

Let's test the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `1 2 3`
   - `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 3`
   - Tents for introverts: 1
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `(2 + 3) // 3 = 1` (one full tent)
   - Remaining people: `2 + 3 - 3 = 2` (one extrovert and one universal)
   - Additional tent: `1` (for the remaining people)
   - Total tents: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `1 4 1`
   - `a = 1`, `b = 4`, `c = 1`
   - Tents for introverts: 1
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `(4 + 1) // 3 = 1` (one full tent)
   - Remaining people: `4 + 1 - 3 = 2` (two extroverts)
   - Since there are no universals left and two extroverts cannot share a tent, it's impossible.
   - Output: `-1`

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `1 4 2`
   - `a = 1`, `b = 4`, `c = 2`
   - Tents for introverts: 1
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `(4 + 2) // 3 = 2` (two full tents)
   - Remaining people: `4 + 2 - 6 = 0`
   - Total tents: `1 + 2 = 3`

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `1 1 1`
   - `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 1`
   - Tents for introverts: 1
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `(1 + 1) // 3 = 0` (no full tent)
   - Remaining people: `1 + 1 - 3 = -1` (impossible, so output: `-1`)

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles the logic and conditions provided in the problem statement. It accurately calculates the minimum number of tents required or outputs `-1` when it's impossible to accommodate everyone.
