Postcondition: `done` is `True` and `count` is equal to `j`. If the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`, then either `count` is greater than 1 and the loop or if statement is exited, or `count2` is 0 and the loop continues. If the character at index `j` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`, then `count2` is greater than `count` and the loop continues with `count` remaining unchanged.
