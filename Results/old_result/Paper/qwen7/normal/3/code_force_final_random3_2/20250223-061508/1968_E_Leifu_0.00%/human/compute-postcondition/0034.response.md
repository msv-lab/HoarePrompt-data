Output State: `t` must be greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 7, `j` is 8.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 4` to `j = n`. After 3 iterations, `j` is 5. Therefore, the loop will continue until `j` reaches `n`. If the loop executes all its iterations, it means `n` must be greater than 7 (since `j` starts at 4 and increments by 1 each iteration). The final value of `j` will be `n`, which is greater than 7. The variable `t` remains greater than 1 and `i` remains 1 as they are not affected by the loop.
