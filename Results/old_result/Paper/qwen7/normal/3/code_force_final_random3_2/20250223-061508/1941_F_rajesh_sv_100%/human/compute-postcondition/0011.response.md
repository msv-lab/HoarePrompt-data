Output State: **`max_diff` is `diff`, `next_max_diff` is `diff`, `index` is 3, `i` is 3, `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`**

Explanation: The code `index = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to the variable `index`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `max_diff` and `next_max_diff` retain their initial values of `diff`, `index` is now 3, `i` remains 3, and `diff` is still `A[1] - A[0]`.
