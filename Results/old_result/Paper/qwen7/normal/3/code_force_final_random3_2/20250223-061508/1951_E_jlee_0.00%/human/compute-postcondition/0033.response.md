Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string.
- `n` is 1.
- `done` is False.
- `x` is the first character of the input string.
- The count of `x` in `s` is equal to 0.
- Either `n` is not odd or the middle element of `s` is equal to `x`.

The print statement is simply `print(1)`. This statement will print the integer 1 directly, regardless of the values of other variables.

Output: **1**
