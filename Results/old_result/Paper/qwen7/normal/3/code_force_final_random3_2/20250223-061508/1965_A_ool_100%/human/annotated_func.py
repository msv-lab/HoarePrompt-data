#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, where the length of the list (n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    if (set_[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns 'Alice'
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, `set_` is a list of unique integers from `arr` sorted in ascending order, `A` is False, and the first element of `set_` is 1
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 4, `not_c` is False, and `A` is False.
    #
    #Explanation: Given the loop iterates based on the length of `set_`, and the output state after 3 iterations shows `i` as 3, it means `set_` has at least 4 elements (since the loop starts from 1). The loop checks if the difference between consecutive elements in `set_` is greater than 1. If it finds such a pair, it breaks the loop and sets `not_c` to False. After 3 iterations, `not_c` is False, and `A` alternates between True and False, ending up as False after an odd number of iterations. Since there are no further conditions provided that would change these values and the loop would continue until `i` reaches the length of `set_`, `i` will be set to 4 upon completion of all iterations, maintaining `not_c` as False and `A` as False.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: `i` is 4, `not_c` is False, and `A` is False.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Bob'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr`, representing the initial number of stones in each pile. It checks if the smallest number of stones in any pile is 1 and if the differences between consecutive piles are exactly 1. Based on these conditions and the alternating boolean value `A`, it determines whether Alice or Bob wins the game and returns either 'Alice' or 'Bob'.
