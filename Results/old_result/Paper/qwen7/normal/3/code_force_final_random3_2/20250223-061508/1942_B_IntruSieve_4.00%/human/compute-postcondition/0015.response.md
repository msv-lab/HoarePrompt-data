Output State: **`minn` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between each element in `arr` and `minn`, `maxx` is 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between each element in `arr` and `minn` to the `mex` list. Since `minn` is 0, `mex` will contain the absolute values of all elements in `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
