Output State: **`left` is 2; `right` is at least 3; `new_arr` is a list containing `arr[0]`, `arr[right]`, and `arr[left]`.**

Explanation: The code `new_arr.append(arr[left])` appends the value of `arr[left]` (which is `arr[2]` given that `left` is 2) to the list `new_arr`. Initially, `new_arr` contains `arr[0]` and `arr[right]`. After appending `arr[left]`, `new_arr` now contains `arr[0]`, `arr[right]`, and `arr[2]`. The values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged.
