Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining if Bob can obtain a different rectangle by cutting an \(a \times b\) rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearranging them.
- The provided solution checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If at least one dimension is even, it prints 'Yes', indicating that a different rectangle can be formed. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
- According to the problem statement, if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always form a different rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. This is because an even dimension allows for the creation of at least one smaller rectangle with an even side, which can then be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
- The solution correctly implements this logic. If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0` will be true, and 'Yes' will be printed. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the condition will be false, and 'No' will be printed.
- The provided examples in the execution summary confirm that the solution works as expected.

Correctness: **True**
