Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `n`. The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - The initial value of `i` is not specified directly in the given state, but it is clear that the loop starts with `i = 1`.
   - The value of `n` is not explicitly stated in the state, but it is implied that `n` is a positive integer since `range(1, n)` is used.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 1.
   - The value of `n` must be such that the loop can run. This means `n` must be at least 1 (since the loop starts at `i = 1` and goes up to `n-1`).

4. **Other Variables**:
   - The variables `left`, `right`, `new_arr`, and `max_beauty` are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect the loop's execution condition. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 1.
- `n` must be at least 1.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1**
