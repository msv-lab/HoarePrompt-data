Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` being 1 (since the range is `range(1, n + 1)`).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `j` must be 1 initially, and `n` must be a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` should be set to 1.
   - `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).

5. **Consider Other Variables**: The variables `c`, `a`, and `cntl` are not directly involved in the loop head, so their initial states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
