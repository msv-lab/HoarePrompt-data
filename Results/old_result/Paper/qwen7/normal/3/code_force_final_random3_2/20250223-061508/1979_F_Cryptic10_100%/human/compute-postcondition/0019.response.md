Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t-2` with two elements removed (one being `v3` and the other being `v1`), `ops` is a list containing tuples where either `(v1, v2)` or `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are included, `v3` is assigned the value of `q(0)`, `v1` and `v2` are assigned the values of `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and `len(vx)` must be greater than 2.**

Explanation: The code removes the element `v3` from the set `vx`. Since `v3` was previously one of the elements in `vx`, after removing `v3`, `vx` now contains integers from 1 to `t-2` with two elements removed: `v3` and `v1`. All other conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged.
