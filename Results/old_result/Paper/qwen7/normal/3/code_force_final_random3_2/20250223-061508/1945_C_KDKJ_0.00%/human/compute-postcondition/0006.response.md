Output State: `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', and `func_1()` has been called three times.

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, `n` remains an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), and `a` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. Additionally, `func_1()` has been called three times as specified by the loop's condition. The loop will continue to execute as long as the input provided by `int(input())` is a positive integer, but since we are considering the final state after all iterations, we can conclude that `func_1()` has been called exactly three times.
