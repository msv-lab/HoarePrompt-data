Output State: **`flag` is False, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `arr[i]` is not equal to the previous value of `arr[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code sets `flag` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `flag` is now `False`, while `i` remains `2`, `n` must still be greater than `1`, and the condition that the current value of `arr[i]` is not equal to the previous value of `arr[i - 1]` also remains true.
