Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', and `func_1()` has been called.**

The code `func_1()` is called, but since the function itself is not defined, no specific changes to variables are known. Therefore, the only thing that can be stated is that `func_1()` has been called. All other variables retain their initial states.
