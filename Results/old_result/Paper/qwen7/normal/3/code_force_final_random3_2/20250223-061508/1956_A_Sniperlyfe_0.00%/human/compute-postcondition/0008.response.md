Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `k` is an integer input from the user.
- `q` is an integer input from the user.
- `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `qs` is a list of integers obtained from splitting another input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `n` is an element of `qs`.

The `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))` statement will join the elements of the list `res` into a single string with spaces between them and then print this string.

Since the exact result of `func_1(n, p)` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact content of `res`. However, we know that `res` is a list of some kind of results returned by `func_1(n, p)`.

Therefore, the output will be a space-separated string of the elements in the list `res`.

Output: **a space-separated string of elements in the list res**
