Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(3, n + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - `i` must be 3.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 4 (since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration).
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4 (since `i` must be less than `n + 1`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` remains the same since it is not involved in the loop head.
- `i` is now 4.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

So, the final state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
