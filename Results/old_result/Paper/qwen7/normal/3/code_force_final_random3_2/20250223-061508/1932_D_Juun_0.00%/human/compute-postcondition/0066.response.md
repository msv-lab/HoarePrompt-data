Output State: **`suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `trumps` is a list with one less element, `answers` is a list with two additional elements where the last element is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump' and the second last element is the previous last element with the rank and suit appended to it followed by popping the trump from the trumps list and appending it to the string.**

Explanation: The code appends a formatted string to the `answers` list. The string includes the `rank` and `suit` variables, which are concatenated with the popped element from the `trumps` list. After appending, the `trumps` list has one less element because an element was popped from it. The `answers` list now has two additional elements, with the last element being the newly appended string and the second last element being the previous last element before the append operation.
