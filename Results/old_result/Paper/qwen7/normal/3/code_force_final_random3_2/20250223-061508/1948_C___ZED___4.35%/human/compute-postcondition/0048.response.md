Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `b` remains the same as the input string, `no_path` remains `False`, and for every `k` in the range of 0 to `n-2` with a step of 2, `b[k]` does not equal '>', and `no_path` will be `False` if any `b[k]` (where `k` is odd and less than `n-1`) is not '>', otherwise it will remain `True`.**
