Postcondition: `i` is 1, `left` is `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is `S[1][0] + S[1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[1][0] + S[1][1])`, and `ans` is either 0 or 1. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, then `ans` remains 0. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans` is greater than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and 1, then `ans` is updated to 1.
