Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for n in qs:`. The objects involved here are `n` and `qs`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `n` is the variable that will take on each value from the list `qs` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `qs` to iterate over. Once `qs` is exhausted, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**:
   - Since `n` is the variable that changes with each iteration, it will start with the first element of `qs`.
   - For the loop to execute, `qs` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `qs` must have at least one element, and `n` will be set to the first element of `qs`.

**State:**
- `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element.
- `n` is the first element of `qs`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of `qs`**
