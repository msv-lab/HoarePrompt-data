Output State: **`prev` is equal to `curr` appended to `tree`, `curr` is nodes[`curr`][1], `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `tree` is a list containing `s`, `curr`, and `curr` is not equal to `e`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` to `nodes[curr][1]`. The other variables (`prev`, `s`, `e`, and `tree`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `prev` is still equal to `curr` appended to `tree`, `curr` is updated to `nodes[curr][1]`, `s` remains as the first element from the `ends` list, `e` remains as the second element from the `ends` list, and `tree` is still a list containing `s`, `curr`, and `curr` is still not equal to `e`.
