Output State: `trumps` is an empty list since it has been popped for all its elements, `answers` is a list containing all valid answers generated during the loop execution with each element formatted as f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}', `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value must be something other than `None`. The loop has executed all iterations, meaning there were no more elements in `trumps` to process, so the function does not return anything and continues until `trumps` is empty.
