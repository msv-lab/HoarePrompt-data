Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True, `count` is 2, `count2` is 0.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the variables `j`, `n`, `done`, `count`, and `count2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
