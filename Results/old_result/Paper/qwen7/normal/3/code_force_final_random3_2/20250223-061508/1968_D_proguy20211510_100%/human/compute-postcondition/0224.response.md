Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of `pathb`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` computed during the loop iterations, and `curr` is the last computed value of `curr` within the loop, and `resb` is either less than or equal to `ress` or greater than or equal to `ress`.
