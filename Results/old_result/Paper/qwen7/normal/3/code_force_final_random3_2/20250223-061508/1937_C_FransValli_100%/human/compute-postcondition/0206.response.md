Output State: **`res` is a new input string from the user, `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, and `arr` is either `[n]` or `[n, n]` depending on the value of `res`, and `res` is reassigned to a new input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` reassigns the variable `res` to a new input string from the user. The values of `maxi`, `i`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their previous states.
