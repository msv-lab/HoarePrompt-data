Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). Specifically, the logic for calculating the MEX value and constructing the permutation is flawed.

Let's analyze the program:

1. The program initializes `mex` as an empty list and `minn` and `maxx` to 0.
2. It iterates through the array `arr` and tries to calculate the MEX value for each element.
3. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. However, this logic does not correctly compute the MEX value.
4. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, it appends the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` to `mex`.

This approach does not correctly compute the MEX value for each prefix of the permutation. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of the permutation, but the program incorrectly handles this calculation.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

The expected output is:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0 1 0 1 2
```

This is incorrect because the MEX values do not match the expected values. For instance, after the first two elements `[0, 1]`, the MEX should be `2`, but the program incorrectly calculates it as `0`.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly compute the MEX value for each prefix of the permutation and ensure that the resulting permutation satisfies the condition \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
