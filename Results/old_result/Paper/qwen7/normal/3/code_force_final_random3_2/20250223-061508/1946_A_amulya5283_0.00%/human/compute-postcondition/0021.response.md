Output State: `operations` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is a sorted version of the second element of `test_cases[i]`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr` with the smallest element being `smallest + 1`, `smallest` is the previous smallest element popped from the heap and is decreased by 1 after the last iteration, `heap` now contains `smallest + 1`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the `operations` counter will be 3, indicating that the loop executed three times. The `heap` will contain the smallest element from the original heap plus one, as it was incremented each time it was pushed back into the heap. The `smallest` variable will be decremented by 1 after the last iteration, reflecting the final operation performed within the loop. All other variables remain unchanged as they were not modified within the loop.
