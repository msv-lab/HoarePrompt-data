Output State: **`i` is `l`, `e` is 2, `l` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is `nums[i]`, and `y` remains as `nums[i]` because `nums[i]` is less than `y`.**

Explanation: The code `x = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `x`. Since `i` is `l`, `x` now holds the value of `nums[l]`. The values of `e`, `l`, and `y` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
