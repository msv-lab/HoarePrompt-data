Output State: `same` is the total number of consecutive occurrences of the most frequent element in the list `ar`, `num` is the last element that had the highest count of consecutive occurrences, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop's execution, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, and `ar` is a list of integers.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `same` will hold the length of the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements in the list `ar`. `num` will be the element that appears consecutively the most times. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `ar` because the loop continues until `i` is no longer less than the length of `ar`. `minn` will be the smallest value of `same` (i.e., the length of the shortest longest sequence of consecutive identical elements found during the loop's execution).
