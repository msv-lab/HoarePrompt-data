Output State: **`resb` is 0, `ress` is 0**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `resb` and `ress`, both to 0. This does not affect the list `paths`, the array `vis`, or the variable `ps`. Therefore, the list `paths` still contains all the elements from `a` starting from index `ps - 1` until the loop breaks, `vis[ps - 1]` is still updated to 1, and `ps` is still updated to the final value it takes when the loop breaks. The loop also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, since no changes were made to `resb` and `ress`, they remain 0.
