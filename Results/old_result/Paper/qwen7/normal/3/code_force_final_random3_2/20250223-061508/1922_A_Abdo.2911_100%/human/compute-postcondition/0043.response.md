Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move directly to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the values of `i` and the condition on `n` remain unchanged.
