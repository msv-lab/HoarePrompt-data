Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` from the input for each test case, which updates the value of `n`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet. Therefore, `t` still holds its initial value, which is an integer between 1 and 100, and `n` is updated to the integer input received.
