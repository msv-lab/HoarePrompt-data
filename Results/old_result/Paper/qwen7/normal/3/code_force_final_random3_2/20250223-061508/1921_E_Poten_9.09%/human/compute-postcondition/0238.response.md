Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing one of the strings 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' for each iteration of the loop, and `i` is equal to `test_cases` - 1. The value of `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces for each iteration. Depending on the conditions inside the loop, 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' is appended to `answers` for each test case.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, `answers` will contain a total of `test_cases` elements, each being either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw', corresponding to the outcome of each test case processed by the loop.
