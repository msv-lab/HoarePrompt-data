Output State: **`n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`. Since the exact values of the input are not specified, we can only state that they are now stored in these variables as integers. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
