### Reasoning

The original assessment identified several issues with the provided functions, particularly focusing on their complexity, handling of edge cases, and optimality. Let's re-evaluate the functions and the overall approach to determine if they are indeed correct.

#### Function `func_1`
- **Purpose**: Computes the maximum possible sum of the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index+1]`.
- **Approach**: Uses a recursive divide-and-conquer strategy to split the subarray and calculate the maximum sum.
- **Issues**:
  - The recursive calls can lead to high computational complexity, especially for large subarrays.
  - The approach does not guarantee finding the optimal solution for all cases.

#### Function `func_2`
- **Purpose**: Generates the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
- **Approach**: Recursively finds the optimal operations by splitting the subarray and using the results from `func_1`.
- **Issues**:
  - Similar to `func_1`, the recursive calls can lead to high computational complexity.
  - The logic for generating operations might not cover all edge cases effectively.

#### Function `make_stairs`
- **Purpose**: Constructs a "staircase" pattern in the array to achieve the maximum sum.
- **Approach**: Attempts to form a staircase pattern by setting consecutive elements to the appropriate values.
- **Issues**:
  - The logic is complex and may not handle all edge cases correctly.
  - It does not guarantee an optimal solution.

### Re-evaluation

Upon closer inspection, let's consider the core requirements of the problem:
1. **Maximize the Sum**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements.
2. **Operations**: Each operation sets a subarray to the MEX value of that subarray.
3. **Efficiency**: The solution must use no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.

A simpler and more efficient approach would involve:
- **Identifying Gaps**: Find gaps in the array where elements are missing.
- **Filling Gaps**: Set the subarray to the smallest missing value (MEX).

This approach ensures that we fill the gaps efficiently and achieve the maximum sum without unnecessary complexity.

### Correctness of the Provided Functions

Given the complexity and potential issues identified, the provided functions do not seem to meet the problem requirements effectively. They might work for some cases but fail in others due to high complexity and edge case handling issues.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The provided functions are likely incorrect for the given problem due to their complexity, potential inefficiency, and failure to handle all edge cases effectively.
