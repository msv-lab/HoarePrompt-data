Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is a sorted version of the second element of `test_cases[i]`, `median_index` is `n // 2`.**

This means that the variable `median_index` is calculated as the integer division of `n` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
