Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump suit` is a string, `trumps` is a list containing one element which is `rank`, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values are all `None`, `rank` is the rank of the card, `suit` is the suit of the card and it is equal to `trump suit`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `rank` to the list `trumps`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `trumps` is now a list containing one element, which is `rank`. The other variables retain their initial conditions.
