Output State: `same` is a value between 1 and `len(ar) - 1`, `num` is the last element in `ar` that has the highest frequency among elements in `ar` up to the last executed iteration, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop execution.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `same` will hold the count of the most frequent element found in the array `ar` (excluding the last element processed, as the loop increments `i` before checking the next element). The variable `num` will be set to the last element in `ar` that had the highest frequency. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `ar`, indicating that all elements in the array have been processed. The variable `minn` will be the minimum count of any element with the highest frequency encountered during the loop's execution.
