Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is the total number of iterations the loop executed; `a[2]` is 0; `b[2]` is 0; `sb` has appended the value 2 and now contains [2, 2]**.

Explanation: The code `sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i`, which is 2, to the list `sb`. Since `i` is 2, `sb` will now contain `[2, 2]`. The values of `n`, `a[2]`, `b[2]`, and the initial value of `i` remain unchanged.
