Reasoning:

1. **Input Processing**: The function correctly processes the input by reading \( n \) lines, each containing \( n \) characters. It also correctly identifies whether a transition video is 'F', 'S', or '?'.

2. **Count Calculation**: The function calculates the cumulative counts of 'F' and 'S' for each scenario. This is done correctly by iterating through the input and updating the counts accordingly.

3. **Decision Logic**: The function makes a decision on how to fill in the '?' characters based on the counts of 'F' and 'S'. However, there are a few issues with the logic:
   - The function incorrectly uses `n // 4 - 1` to determine where to place 'F' or 'S'. This should be based on the condition \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\).
   - The function does not ensure that the resulting sequence adheres to the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive 'F' or 'S'.

4. **Implementation Issues**:
   - The function uses `sa` and `sb` to store indices where 'F' and 'S' are already decided. However, it does not handle the case where the number of undecided '?' is more than necessary.
   - The logic to decide whether to fill '?' with 'F' or 'S' is flawed. It should consider the entire sequence and not just a subset of indices.

Given these issues, the current implementation does not guarantee that the generated sequence will satisfy the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive 'F' or 'S' for any permutation of scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
