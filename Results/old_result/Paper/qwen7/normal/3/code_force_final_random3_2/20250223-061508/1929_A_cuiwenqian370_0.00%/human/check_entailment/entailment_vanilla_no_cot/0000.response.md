Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array after rearranging its elements. Here's why:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting and Rearranging**:
   - The array is sorted.
   - Elements are then rearranged such that the smallest and largest elements alternate. This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
3. **Calculating Beauty**:
   - After rearranging, the program calculates the beauty of the array by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
4. **Output**: The program outputs the maximum beauty for each test case.

The logic in `func_1` is sound and should work correctly for the given constraints. The approach of alternating the smallest and largest elements ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which aligns with the goal of maximizing the beauty of the array.
