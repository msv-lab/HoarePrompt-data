Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `j` will be `n + r + 1`, `n` will still be within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 500, `r` will remain non-negative and unchanged, and `i` will be equal to `n + 1`. The variable `sum` will contain the sum described in the initial state, and `t` will be greater than 0.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `j` will reach `n + r + 1`, indicating that every possible value in the specified range has been processed. The variables `n`, `r`, and `i` maintain their final values from the last iteration, with `n` capped at 500, `r` remaining non-negative, and `i` set to `n + 1`. The `sum` variable holds the calculated sum as per the initial conditions, and `t` remains positive as required.
