Output: **n // 2 * b (where n is the first integer input, and b is the third integer input)**

Explanation:
- `n` is the first integer input and is specified to be even.
- `b` is the third integer input.
- The expression `n // 2` means integer division of `n` by 2, which results in `n / 2` rounded down to the nearest whole number.
- Multiplying this result by `b` gives the final value that will be printed.

Given these conditions, the print statement will output the product of half of `n` (integer division) and `b`.
