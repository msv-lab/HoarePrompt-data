Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). It returns different values based on the relationship between `a` and `b` for each test case.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing three integers `t`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, the function evaluates the relationship between `a` and `b` and returns a specific value based on that relationship. However, since the exact return values or conditions are not specified in the given output, the functionality focuses on the implied processing of `a` and `b` for each test case `t`.
