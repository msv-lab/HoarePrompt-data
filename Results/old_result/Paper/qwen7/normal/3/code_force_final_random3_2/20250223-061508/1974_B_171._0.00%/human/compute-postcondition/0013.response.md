Output State: **`decoded` is an empty list, `mapping` is a dictionary with the key `'b'` and the value `'a'`, and `c` is 98.**

The `break` statement does not affect any variables or their values. It only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement, which is not present in the given code snippet. Therefore, the values of `decoded`, `mapping`, and `c` remain unchanged.
