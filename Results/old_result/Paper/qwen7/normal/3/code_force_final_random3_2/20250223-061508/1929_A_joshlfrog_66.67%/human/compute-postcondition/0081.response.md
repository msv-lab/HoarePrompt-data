Output State: **`i` is `l`, `e` is 2, `l` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is `nums[i]`, and `y` is `nums[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `x = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `x`. Since `i` is `l`, `x` becomes `nums[l]`. The values of `e` and `l` remain unchanged, and `y` is still set to `nums[i]` (which is `nums[l]`).
