Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is the first element of `tab`.
- `tab` is a list containing at least 60 elements.
- `rep` is 60.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `Min` is 0.
- `Max` is 0.
- `number` is the last value appended to `tab` during the 60th iteration.
- `tab` is a list containing the string representations of all `number` values from each iteration.

The print statement `print(i, end=' ')` will print the value of `i`, which is the first element of the list `tab`.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe it as the first element of `tab`.

Output: **i (where i is the first element of the list tab)**
