The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `wins` is increased by 1 to 2, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

State: **`wins` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
