Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `e` is a set containing unique elements from the list `l`, `m` is the length of the list `l`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is the length of the list `l`. Since the if condition `1 in l` does not change the variables' values or their relationships, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
