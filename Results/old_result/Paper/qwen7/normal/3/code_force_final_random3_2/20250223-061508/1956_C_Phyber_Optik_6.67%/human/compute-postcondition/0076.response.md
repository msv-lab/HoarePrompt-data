Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is set to 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `r` is set to 0.
- The current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
2. The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object into separate arguments for the `print` function.
3. Therefore, the `print` function will print each number in the range separated by spaces.

Given the initial conditions, the output will be a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n**
