Postcondition: `tmp` is a list, `y` is an integer, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `ii` is `ii + 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `y` is the third integer input, `len(a)` must be at least 1, and `i` is either 2 or 3. If `a[2] - a[1] == 2`, then `tmp` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `tmp` gains an additional element which is `((a[2] - a[1]) // 2)`.
