Output State: **`operational_list` must contain at least two fewer elements, `x` is undefined, `x_rev` is 0, `rev_val` contains the reversed string of `x`**.

Explanation: The code appends the reverse of `x` to the list `rev_val`. Since `x` is undefined, its reverse cannot be determined directly, but we know that `rev_val` now includes the reversed version of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
