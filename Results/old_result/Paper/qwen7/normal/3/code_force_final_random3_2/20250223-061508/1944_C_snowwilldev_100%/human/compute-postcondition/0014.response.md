Output State: **`i` is 0, `N` is a non-negative integer, `cnt` contains the count of each element in the list `a` up to the `N-1`th index, and the current value of `cnt[i]` is 2, `t` is 1**.

The variable `t` is incremented by 1, making its new value 1. All other variables remain unchanged, so `i` is still 0, `N` remains a non-negative integer, and `cnt` retains its original structure with `cnt[i]` now being 2 since it was initially 1 and has been incremented.
