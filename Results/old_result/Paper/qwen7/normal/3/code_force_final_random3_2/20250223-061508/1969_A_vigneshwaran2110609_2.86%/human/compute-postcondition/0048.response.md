Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is 49, `x` is 50, and `flag` is True.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = x-1`. Given that the loop has executed all its iterations (from 1 to 50), `i` will be 49 at the end of the loop. The value of `x` remains unchanged at 50 since it is not modified within the loop. The condition `if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:` checks if any element in the list `l` satisfies this condition. If such an element is found, `flag` is set to `True` and the loop breaks. Since the loop completes all its iterations without breaking (implying that the condition was met for some `i` during the loop), `flag` remains `True`.
