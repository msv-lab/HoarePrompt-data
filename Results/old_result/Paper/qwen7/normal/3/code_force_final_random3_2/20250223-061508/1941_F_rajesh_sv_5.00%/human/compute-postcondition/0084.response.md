Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `l` is strictly less than `h`; `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` to `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f`, respectively. It does not affect the values of `ans`, `left`, `right`, `l`, `h`, `mid`, or `f`. Therefore, the output state retains the original conditions except for the updated values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum`.
