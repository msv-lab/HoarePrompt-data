Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `t`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in `range(t)`, meaning the loop will continue as long as `i < t`.
3. **Determine the state adjustments needed**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time. This means `i` should be incremented by 1, and `t` should remain unchanged.

Given the postconditions and the loop condition, we need to check if `t` is greater than or equal to 3. If it is, then the loop will continue. If it is less than 3, the loop will terminate.

Since the loop condition depends on `t`, and no other variables are mentioned in the loop head, we only need to adjust `i` and `t`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `w` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, and `t` is an input integer.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the loop continues. Otherwise, it terminates.
- For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`w` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `i` is `i + 1`**. 

However, since `t` is not explicitly mentioned to change in the loop body, we assume `t` remains the same unless otherwise specified.

So, the final state is:

State: **`w` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `i` is `i + 1`**.
