Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial conditions for `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0 and `i` is still 1. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are the integers input by the user.
