Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` is used as the loop counter. It starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.
   - The variable `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `mak` is `n`.
   - `mak2` is `n`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `pans` is an empty list.
   - `s` is the string `'>', n`.
   - `n` is the input integer.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` should be set to 0 (the initial value before the first iteration).
   - `n` should be checked to ensure it is a positive integer (since `range(n)` requires `n` to be non-negative).

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` should be adjusted to 0.
   - `n` should be ensured to be greater than or equal to 0.

Therefore, the final state needed for the loop to execute is:

**State: `mak` is `n`, `mak2` is `n`, `i` is 0, `pans` is an empty list, `s` is the string `'>', n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0**
