Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `len(vx) > 2`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `v1` is `len(vx) - 4`
   - `v2` is `len(vx) - 3`
   - `vx` has one less element than before the removal.
   - If `v2 > 0`, then `ops` has an additional element `(v1, v2)`.
   - Otherwise, `v3` is the return value of `q(0)`, and `ops` is added with `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `len(vx)` must be greater than 2.

4. **Check the current state**:
   - Since `vx` has one less element than before the removal, the length of `vx` at the end of the previous iteration was `len(vx) + 1`.
   - Given the postconditions, `len(vx) + 1` must be greater than 3 (since the loop continues as long as `len(vx) > 2`).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `len(vx) + 1` must be greater than 3, which means `len(vx)` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `len(vx)` to ensure it is greater than 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`v1` is `len(vx) - 4`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 3`, `vx` has one less element than before the removal, and `len(vx)` must be greater than 2**.
