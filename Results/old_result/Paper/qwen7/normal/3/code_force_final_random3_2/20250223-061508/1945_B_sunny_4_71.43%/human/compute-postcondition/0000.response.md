Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and it is assigned the value of `int(input())`.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, after executing the code, `t` will still be an integer within the same range, but its specific value will be the one entered by the user. All other conditions and constraints on `t` remain valid.
