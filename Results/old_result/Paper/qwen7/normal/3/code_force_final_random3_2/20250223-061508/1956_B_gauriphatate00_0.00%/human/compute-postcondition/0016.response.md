Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by 3 * n + 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data[idx - n:idx]` converted from the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and of length `n`, `results` is a list to which the return value of `func_1(n, a)` has been appended, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[idx]`, and `a` is updated to be the map of integers from the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and of length `n`.**

Explanation: The code `idx += n` increments the value of `idx` by `n`. Therefore, the new value of `idx` is the original value of `idx` plus `n`. Given that `idx` was initially increased by `2 * n + 1`, the new increase is `3 * n + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.
