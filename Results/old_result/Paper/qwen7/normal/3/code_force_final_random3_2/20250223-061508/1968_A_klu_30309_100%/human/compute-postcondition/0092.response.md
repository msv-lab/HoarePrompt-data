Output State: **`results` is a list containing the values [1, 1, 1]**.

This means that for each `x` in `test_cases`, the value of `y` which maximizes the sum of `gcd(x, y) + y` is 1, and the maximum sum found was 3. After iterating through all elements in `test_cases`, the loop determined that the best `y` value for each `x` is 1, and this result is stored in the list `results`.
