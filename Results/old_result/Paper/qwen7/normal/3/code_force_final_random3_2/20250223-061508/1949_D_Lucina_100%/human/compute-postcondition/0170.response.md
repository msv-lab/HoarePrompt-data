Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `total` is 0
- `i` is 1
- `nx` is either 'F' or 'S'
- `j` is 2
- `n` is 4

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n + 1`.

### Loop Head:
- The loop variable is `j`.
- The loop range is `range(1, n + 1)`.

### Adjusting States:
- The only variable in the loop head is `j`.
- The value of `j` changes with each iteration of the loop.

### Current Value of `j`:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.

### Next Iteration:
- The loop will increment `j` by 1, so `j` will become 3.

### Updated State:
- `total` remains 0.
- `i` remains 1.
- `nx` remains either 'F' or 'S'.
- `j` becomes 3.
- `n` remains 4.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `nx` is either 'F' or 'S', `j` is 3, `n` is 4**
