Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is an input integer and its current value is greater than 0.
- `y` is an input integer and its current value is 0.
- At least one of `x` or `y` is less than or equal to 0, but since `x` is explicitly stated to be greater than 0, this condition does not apply to `x`.
- Additionally, `x` is not equal to 0 and `y` is not greater than 0, which aligns with the current values of `x` and `y`.

Given these conditions, we need to evaluate the expression `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

Since `x` is a positive integer greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the division `x / 15` will result in a floating-point number. The `math.ceil` function will then round this number up to the nearest integer.

Therefore, the output will be the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15.

Output: **math.ceil(x / 15)**
