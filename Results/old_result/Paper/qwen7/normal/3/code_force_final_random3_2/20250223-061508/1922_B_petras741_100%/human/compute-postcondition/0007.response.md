Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for j in range(n):` will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - The variable `j` will take values from 0 to `n-1` during the loop iterations.
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `w` is a list of integers from the input.
- `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.

We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` is already given to be greater than or equal to 3, it satisfies this condition.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than 0 (which is already satisfied).

Since `j` is a loop variable that will be initialized to 0 and incremented within the loop, no specific state adjustment is needed for `j`.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
