Output State: **`res` contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for every `n` in `qs`.**

In Natural Language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the list `res` will contain the result of applying the function `func_1(n, p)` to every element `n` in the list `qs`. This means `res` will have as many elements as there are elements in `qs`, with each element being the result of the function call `func_1(n, p)` for the corresponding `n` in `qs`.
