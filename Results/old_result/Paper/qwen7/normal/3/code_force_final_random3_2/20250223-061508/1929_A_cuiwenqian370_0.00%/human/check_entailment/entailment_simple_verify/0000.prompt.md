You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and arr is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.
def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()

    #State: Output State: `left` is `n - 1`, `right` is 0, and `new_arr` is a list containing all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]` in a specific order.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `left` will be equal to `right + 1`, meaning `left` will be `n - 1` and `right` will be 0. The `new_arr` list will contain all elements from the original array `arr`, but in a specific order where elements from the end of the array are added before elements from the beginning, except when `left` equals `right`, in which case only one element is appended.
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to `n-1`.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `max_beauty` will hold the total beauty calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between every adjacent pair of elements in the `new_arr` list, starting from `new_arr[1]` up to `new_arr[n-1]`. The value of `i` will be `n`, and the loop will have iterated `n-1` times, covering all possible pairs of consecutive elements in `new_arr`.
    return max_beauty
    #`The program returns max_beauty which is the sum of the absolute differences between each consecutive pair of elements in new_arr from index 1 to n-1`



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The issue lies in the rearrangement logic within the `func_1` function. Specifically, the program alternates between the smallest and largest remaining elements, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array.

To illustrate, consider the following input:

```
3
4
10 5 15 20
```

The expected output should be 30 because we can rearrange the array to `[10, 20, 5, 15]`, resulting in a beauty of `(20-10) + (5-20) + (15-5) = 10 + (-15) + 10 = 5`.

However, the current implementation will sort the array and then alternate between the smallest and largest elements, resulting in an incorrect rearrangement. For the above example, the program would rearrange the array to `[5, 15, 10, 20]`, leading to a beauty of `(15-5) + (10-15) + (20-10) = 10 - 5 + 10 = 15`.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and thus is incorrect.
