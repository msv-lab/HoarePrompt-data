Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string; `res` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `res` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
