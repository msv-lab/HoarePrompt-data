Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`, and `(b + c) % 3` is not equal to 0.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, ensuring that the conditions specified in both the if and else parts are included. Specifically, it indicates that `t`, `n`, and `i` retain their initial conditions, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, and `k` is adjusted to `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` under the condition that `(b + c) % 3` is not equal to 0.
