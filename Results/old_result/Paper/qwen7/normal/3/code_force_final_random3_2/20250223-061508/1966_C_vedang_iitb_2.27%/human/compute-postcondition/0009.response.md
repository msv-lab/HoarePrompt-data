Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, `winNext` is the result of calling `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_2` with the sublist `a[1:]` (which is `a` starting from the second element) and `n - 1` as arguments. The result of this function call is assigned to the variable `winNext`. The original list `a` and the value of `n` remain unchanged.
