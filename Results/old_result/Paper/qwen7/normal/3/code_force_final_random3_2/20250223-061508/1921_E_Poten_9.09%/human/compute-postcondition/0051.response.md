Postcondition: **`test_cases` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `answers` is either a list containing 'Draw' or ['Bob'], `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, the first element of `clues` is not 1, and the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`. Additionally, the current value of `clues[2]` is even and the current value of `clues[4]` is even, or the current value of `clues[2]` is odd and the current value of `clues[4]` is odd. The fourth element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the current value of `clues[3]` is greater than the current value of `clues[5]`. The absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, ensuring that all conditions specified in the initial precondition are retained and that the possible outcomes of the if-else block are accurately described.
