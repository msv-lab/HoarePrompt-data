Postcondition: `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is incremented by either 1 or 2, `n` is the integer input by the user, and `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\log_2(n)\). If `n` is 1, `power` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, `power` is adjusted based on whether it equals `n` or is set to the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\log_2(n)\) minus 1.
