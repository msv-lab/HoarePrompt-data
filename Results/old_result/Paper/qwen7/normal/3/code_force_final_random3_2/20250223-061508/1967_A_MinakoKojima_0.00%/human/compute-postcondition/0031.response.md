Postcondition: `ans` is updated to its current value multiplied by the difference between each consecutive element in the array `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
