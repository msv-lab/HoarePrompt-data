Output State: **`minn` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `mex` is a list containing 0, `maxx` is 0.**

The value of `minn` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `mex`, and `maxx` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
