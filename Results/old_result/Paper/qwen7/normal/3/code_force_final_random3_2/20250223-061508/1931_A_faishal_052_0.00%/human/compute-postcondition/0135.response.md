Output State: **`lex` is an integer - 26, `arr` is a list containing the elements 1 and 26**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 26. Since `lex` was initially an integer, after subtracting 26, it remains an integer but its value is now `lex - 26`. The list `arr` remains unchanged with its elements as 1 and 26.
