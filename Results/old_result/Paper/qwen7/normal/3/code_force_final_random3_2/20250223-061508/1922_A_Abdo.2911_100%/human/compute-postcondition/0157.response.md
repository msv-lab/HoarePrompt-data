Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the variables retain their initial states, and the break statement indicates that execution would exit the current loop or conditional structure.
