Output State: `empty` is True, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing tuples representing all the edges entered during the loop, `start` is an integer such that \(1 \leq start \leq n\), `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key has a list as its value containing all the nodes connected to it, `i` is \(n-1\), and both `nodes[u]` and `nodes[v]` contain each other for every edge \((u, v)\) added to the graph.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the `nodes` defaultdict will represent the entire graph with each node pointing to all nodes it is connected to via the edges provided by the user inputs. The variable `i` will be set to \(n-1\) since the loop runs \(n-1\) times, and `edges` will contain all the edges as tuples.
