### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Input**: For each test case, the program correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIRS' if this condition is met.
4. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
5. **Default Case**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'NONE'.

Given that the conditions for 'STAIRS' and 'PEAK' are correctly implemented and all possible outcomes are covered, the program should work as expected according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The program logic matches the problem requirements accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
