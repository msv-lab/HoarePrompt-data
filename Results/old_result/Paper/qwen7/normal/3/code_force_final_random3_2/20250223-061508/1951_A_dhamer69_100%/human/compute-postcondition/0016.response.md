Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string from the user, and `n` is not equal to 2; `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`.**

Explanation: The code `count_1 = s.count('1')` counts the number of times the character '1' appears in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `count_1`. The values of the other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
