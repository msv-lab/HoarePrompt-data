Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `is_already_stairs` remains True
   - `j` is 0
   - `i` must be greater than 0

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from 0 to `i` (inclusive).

3. **Loop Body**: 
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that if `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to 0, then `is_already_stairs` remains True.

4. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0, and `i` must be greater than 0.
   - `is_already_stairs` remains True.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented from 0 to 1.
   - Since `i` must still be greater than 0, it does not change.
   - `is_already_stairs` remains True unless the condition inside the loop body changes it.

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 1.
   - `i` remains unchanged as it must still be greater than 0.
   - `is_already_stairs` remains True unless the loop body changes it, but since no such change is mentioned, it stays True.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `j` becomes 1
- `i` remains greater than 0
- `is_already_stairs` remains True

**Final Answer**:
State: **`is_already_stairs` remains True, `j` is 1, and `i` must be greater than 0**
