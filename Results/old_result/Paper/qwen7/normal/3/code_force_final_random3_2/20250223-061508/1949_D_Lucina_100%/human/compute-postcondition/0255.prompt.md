Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `total` is 0, `i` is 5, `n` is 4, `a[4]` is 0, `b[4]` is 0, `sa` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], `sb` is [1, 2, 3, 4].
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sa[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sa[:n // 4 - 1]:
            nx += 'F'
        else:
            nx += 'S'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `total` is 0, `i` is 5, `nx` is either 'FFxF', 'FSxF', 'SFSx', 'SSxF', 'FFSx', 'FSSF', 'SFFx', or 'SSSx', `j` is 4, `n` is 4.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (from `j = 1` to `j = 4`), the value of `i` will increment to 5 because it starts at 1 and increments by 1 at the end of each iteration without being reset. The variable `nx` will contain a string of length 4 based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration of the loop. The exact content of `nx` depends on the values of `xx[i][j-1]`, the presence of `i` or `j` in `sa[:1]` (since `n=4`, `n//4-1` equals 0), and the order in which these conditions are met across the four iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `total` is 0, `i` is 5, `nx` is 'FFS', `j` is 7, and `n` is 4.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations (4 times since `n` is 4), the variable `j` will be `n + 1 = 5 + 2 = 7` because `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`. The variable `nx` will be 'FFS' because the loop processes `j` values from 1 to 4, and based on the given conditions, it appends 'F' twice and 'S' once to `nx`. The variable `i` remains 5 as it is not modified within the loop, and `total` remains 0 as there is no operation modifying it in the provided loop body.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `total` remains 0, `i` is 6, `nx` is 'FFS', `j` is 10, and `n` is 4.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n + 1 - 1`, which means it will run 4 times since `n` is 4. Based on the given output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that:

- After the first iteration (`j = 1`), `nx` became 'F'.
- After the second iteration (`j = 2`), `nx` became 'FF'.
- After the third iteration (`j = 3`), `nx` became 'FFS'.

Since the loop continues until `j = n`, which is 4 in this case, the fourth iteration would set `j` to 4. Given the pattern, `nx` would not change further as it already contains 'FFS' and no new characters are added because the condition `xx[i][j - 1] != '?'` does not specify any further additions beyond the third iteration. Therefore, `nx` remains 'FFS' after all iterations, and the other variables (`total`, `i`, `j`, and `n`) remain unchanged as per the problem statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
