Output State: **After all iterations, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime ** (factors[prime] + 1)` and the loop has yielded `factor * prime_to_i` for each iteration from 1 to `factors[prime] + 1`.**

Explanation: The loop runs `factors[prime] + 1` times. Each time it runs, `prime_to_i` is multiplied by `prime`. Therefore, after all iterations, `prime_to_i` will be equal to `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime] + 1`. Additionally, the loop yields `factor * prime_to_i` for each iteration, so this value is produced `factors[prime] + 1` times.
