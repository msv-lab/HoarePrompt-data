Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `resb` is the maximum value obtained from the loop's iterations, `ress` is 0, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` plus the last computed `pathb[i]`, `pres` is 0, `i` is equal to `len(pathb)`, `curr` is the final computed value before the loop exits.

To explain further, after the loop completes all its iterations, `resb` will hold the highest value that was calculated during any iteration of the loop. The variable `preb` will contain the cumulative sum of all elements in `pathb`. Since the loop breaks when `k < i + 1`, `i` will be equal to the length of `pathb`. The variables `ress`, `pres`, and `curr` will be 0 because they are not updated within the loop body and remain as their initial values.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(paths)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
    pres += paths[i]
    ress = max(ress, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `resb` is the maximum value obtained from the loop's iterations, `ress` is `curr`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` plus the last computed `pathb[i]`, `pres` is `paths[1] * k`, `i` is 2, and `curr` is `paths[0] * k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `resb` is the maximum value obtained from the loop's iterations, `ress` is `max(ress, paths[1] * k + paths[2] * (k - 3))`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` plus the last computed `pathb[i]`, `pres` is `paths[1] * k + paths[i]`, `i` is 4, `curr` is `paths[1] * k + paths[2] * (k - 3)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `resb` is the maximum value obtained from the loop's iterations, `ress` is max(ress, `paths[1] * k + paths[2] * (k - 3)`), `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` plus the last computed `pathb[i]`, `pres` is `paths[1] * k + paths[i] + paths[1] * k + paths[2] * (k - 3) + paths[6] * (k - 6)`, `i` is 6, `curr` is `paths[1] * k + paths[2] * (k - 3) + paths[6] * (k - 6)`, `ress` is updated to max(ress, `paths[1] * k + paths[2] * (k - 3) + paths[6] * (k - 6)`)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
