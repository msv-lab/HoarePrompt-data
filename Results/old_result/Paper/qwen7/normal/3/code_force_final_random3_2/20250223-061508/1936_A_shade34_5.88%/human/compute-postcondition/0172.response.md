Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-2`, `pans` is a list of length `n`, and `mak` is equal to `n-1` if the input string is '>' for every iteration from 1 to `n-1`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0. The input integer `k` is now `k-1`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `i` from `n-1` to `n-2` because `i` was previously defined as `n-1`. All other variables (`pans`, `mak`, and `k`) remain unchanged in terms of their conditions and values relative to the initial state.
