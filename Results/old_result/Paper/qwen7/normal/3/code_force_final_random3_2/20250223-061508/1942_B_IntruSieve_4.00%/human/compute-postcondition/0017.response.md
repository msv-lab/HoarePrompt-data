Postcondition: `minn` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between each element in `arr` and `minn`, `maxx` is the current maximum of the absolute differences between elements in `arr` and `minn`. The current value of `maxx` is greater than the previous value of `maxx`.
