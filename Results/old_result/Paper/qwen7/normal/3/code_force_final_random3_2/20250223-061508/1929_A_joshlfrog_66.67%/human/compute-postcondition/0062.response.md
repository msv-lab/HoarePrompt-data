Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` equals `l-1`, `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `x` is the maximum value found in the list `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value found in the list `nums`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (i.e., `i` reaches `l-1`), the variable `x` will hold the maximum value from the list `nums`, and `y` will hold the minimum value from the list `nums`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `e`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and `nums`) retain their final states as described.
