Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is an index within the bounds of the list `arr`.
   - `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt` + 1 if `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is increased by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i-1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `i-1 + 1 = i`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the loop.

5. **Update the conditions**:
   - `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `i` (i.e., `i-1`).
   - `cnt` will be reset or updated based on the new value of `arr[i-1]`.

Given these points, let's formulate the state for the start of the next iteration:

- `i` will be `i-1 + 1 = i`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `i-1`.
- `cnt` will be reset or updated based on the new value of `arr[i-1]`.

Since the exact values of `ans` and `cnt` depend on the specific values in the list `arr` and the value `val`, we cannot provide exact numerical values for them. However, we can describe the general state:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of the list `arr`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt` + 1 if `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is increased by 1.**

To summarize, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of the list `arr`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt` + 1 if `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is increased by 1.**
