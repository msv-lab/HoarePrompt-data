Based on the initial state provided:

- `resb` will hold the highest value obtained from the loop's iterations.
- `ress` will be 0.
- `preb` will be the sum of all elements in `pathb`.
- `pres` will be 0.
- `i` will be equal to `len(pathb)`.
- `curr` will be the final computed value before the loop exits.
- `resb` will be greater than or equal to `ress`.

The `print('Draw')` statement simply prints the string "Draw" without referencing any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **Draw**
