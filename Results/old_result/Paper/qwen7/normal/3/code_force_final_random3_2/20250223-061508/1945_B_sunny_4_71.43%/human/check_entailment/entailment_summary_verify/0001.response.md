### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the problem statement carefully.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time.
- Both installations launch fireworks every `a` and `b` minutes respectively.
- Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        A = int(m / a) + 1
        B = int(m / b) + 1
        print(A + B)
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes up to 10,000 test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates `A` and `B` as the number of launches within the visibility period `m`.
- It then prints the sum `A + B`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the parameters `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case.

2. **Calculations:**
   - `A = int(m / a) + 1`: This calculates the number of times the first installation launches fireworks within the visibility period `m`.
   - `B = int(m / b) + 1`: This calculates the number of times the second installation launches fireworks within the visibility period `m`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the sum `A + B`, which is the total number of launches from both installations within the visibility period `m`.

#### Correctness:
- The program correctly counts the number of launches from each installation within the visibility period `m`.
- However, the key issue is that the program does not account for the overlapping visibility periods of fireworks from both installations. The program assumes that each launch by one installation does not overlap with any launch by the other installation within the same visibility period, which is incorrect.

To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to understand how often both installations launch fireworks at the same time. The correct approach involves calculating the LCM and determining the number of simultaneous launches within the visibility period.

However, the given program does not implement this logic. Instead, it simply sums the number of launches from both installations within the visibility period `m`, which is an overestimate due to the lack of consideration for overlapping visibility periods.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not account for the overlapping visibility periods of fireworks from both installations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
