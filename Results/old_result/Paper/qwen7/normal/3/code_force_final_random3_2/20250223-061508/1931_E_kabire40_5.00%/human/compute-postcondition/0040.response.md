Postcondition: `x` is 1, `rev_val` contains at least one element, and `rev_res` is updated as follows: if `x` is even, `rev_res` is the previous value of `rev_res` plus the string representation of `val_in`, where `val_in` is an integer equal to the reversed string of `rev_val[1]`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is the original `rev_res` plus the reverse of `rev_val[1]`.
