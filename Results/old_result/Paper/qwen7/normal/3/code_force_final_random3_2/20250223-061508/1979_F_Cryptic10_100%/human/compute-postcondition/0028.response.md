Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `vx` has at least 1 element (since one element was removed), `ops` is a list containing tuples where either `(v1, v2)` or `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are included, `v1` is equal to `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `v2` is also equal to `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `v3` is assigned the value of `q(0)` and `v3` is no longer in `vx`.**

Explanation: The code removes `v3` from the list `vx`. Since `v3` is assigned the value of `q(0)`, it is now removed from `vx`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
