Output State: **arr is [i+2, i+1], n is at least i + 2, maxi is 0, res is the input string from the user.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be one less than `n`. The loop will continue to append `i` to `arr` if the user inputs `=` and will reset `arr` to `[i]` if the user inputs `<`. Given the pattern observed in the first three iterations, after all iterations, `arr` will contain the last two values of `i` (which would be `i+1` and `i+2`) in the order they were appended, with `maxi` remaining at 0 since it is never updated within the loop. The variable `n` will be at least `i + 2`, and `res` will hold the last input received from the user during the loop's execution.
