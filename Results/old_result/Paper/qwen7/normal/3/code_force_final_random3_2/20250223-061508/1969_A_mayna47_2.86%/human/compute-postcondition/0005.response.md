Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is 2.
- `p` is a list of 2 integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 2 and `p_i` ≠ i, and all `p_i` are distinct. This means `p` can only be `[1, 2]` or `[2, 1]`.
- `v` is a list of length 3 where the first element is 0, and the other two elements are integer inputs split from the input string.

The `print(2)` statement simply prints the integer 2.

Output: **2**
