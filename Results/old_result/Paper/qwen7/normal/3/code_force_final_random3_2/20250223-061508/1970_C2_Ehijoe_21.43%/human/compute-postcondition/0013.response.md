Output State: **`empty` is True, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing one tuple \((u, v)\), `start` is an integer such that \(1 \leq start \leq n\), `nodes` is a defaultdict where all values are initially lists, `i` is 4, `u` is the first integer input, `v` is the second integer input.**

The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and splits them by whitespace, converting each to an integer. These values are then assigned to `u` and `v`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
