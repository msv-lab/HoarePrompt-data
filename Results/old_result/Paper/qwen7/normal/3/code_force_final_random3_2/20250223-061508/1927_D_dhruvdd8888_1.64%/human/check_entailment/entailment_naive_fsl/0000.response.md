Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are no two different elements within the queried range. Specifically, the program assumes that there will always be a pair of different elements within the queried range, but this is not necessarily true. For example, consider the following input:

```
5
1 1 1 1 1
1
1 5
```

The program will output `1 2` or similar, but since all elements in the range are the same (1), such a pair does not exist. The program should output `-1 -1` in this case. However, the current implementation does not check for this scenario, leading to incorrect results.
