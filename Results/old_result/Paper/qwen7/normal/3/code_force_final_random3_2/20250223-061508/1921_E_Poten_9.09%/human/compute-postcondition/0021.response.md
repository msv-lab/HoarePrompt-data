Postcondition: `test_cases` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces. The first element of `clues` is not 1, and the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`. Additionally, the current value of `clues[2]` is even and the current value of `clues[4]` is even, or the current value of `clues[2]` is odd and the current value of `clues[4]` is odd. The fourth element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the current value of `clues[3]` is less than the current value of `clues[5]`. The absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1. The condition `(clues[3] - 1 >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[5] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))` is true.
