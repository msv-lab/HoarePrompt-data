Output State: **`x` is equal to `y`, `ans` is increased by 1, `inp` is a list of integers with at least one element, `a` is the next element in `inp`, `y` is the next element in `inp`.**

The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
