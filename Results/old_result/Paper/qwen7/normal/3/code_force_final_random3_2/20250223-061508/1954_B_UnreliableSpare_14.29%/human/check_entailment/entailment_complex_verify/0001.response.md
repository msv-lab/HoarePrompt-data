### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given array to make it non-beautiful. An array is beautiful if it can be made into an array of all identical elements by repeatedly applying a specific operation.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The array is initially beautiful, meaning it can be reduced to a single value by the given operation.
   - We need to find the minimum number of removals to break this property.
   - If the array already consists of all identical elements, no removals are needed, and the answer is -1.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same).
     - If the array is uniform, it prints `-1`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of removals required to break the beauty property.

4. **Detailed Breakdown**:
   - The function `func_1()` is called for each test case.
   - It checks if the array is uniform using a simple loop.
   - If the array is not uniform, it counts the occurrences of the first element (`val`) and finds the minimum count of consecutive non-uniform segments.
   - This logic ensures that the minimum number of removals is calculated correctly.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the uniform array case correctly by printing `-1`.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the logic for calculating the minimum number of removals. The current implementation only considers the first element (`val`) and does not account for other possible sequences that could lead to the array becoming non-beautiful.

6. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotation states that the function checks if the array is uniform and if not, it calculates the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the first element (`val`). This is incorrect because it does not consider all possible segments that could lead to the array becoming non-beautiful.
   - The annotation also mentions that the function finds the minimum count of consecutive non-uniform segments, which is not implemented correctly in the code.

7. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify all segments where the array is not uniform and calculate the minimum number of removals required to break the beauty property.
   - The current implementation only considers the first element and does not handle all possible segments.

8. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code does not correctly implement the solution for the problem statement provided. It fails to account for all possible segments that could lead to the array becoming non-beautiful.
