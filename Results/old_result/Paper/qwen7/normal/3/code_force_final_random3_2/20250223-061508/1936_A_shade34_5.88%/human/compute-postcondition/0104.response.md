Output State: **`mak` is `n`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing the elements `n-1`, `n-1`, `n`, and `s` is the string `'>', n`.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is `n`) to `mak`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state of `mak` is `n`, while `mak2` remains `n-1`, `i` remains `n`, `pans` remains a list containing the elements `n-1`, `n-1`, `n`, and `s` remains the string `'>', n`.
