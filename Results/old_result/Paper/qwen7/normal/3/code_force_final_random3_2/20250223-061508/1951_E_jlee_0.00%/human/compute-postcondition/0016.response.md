The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, it only affects the flow of the loop. The values of the variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string, `n` is 1, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of the input string, the current value of `x` is not equal to the last element of `s`.**
