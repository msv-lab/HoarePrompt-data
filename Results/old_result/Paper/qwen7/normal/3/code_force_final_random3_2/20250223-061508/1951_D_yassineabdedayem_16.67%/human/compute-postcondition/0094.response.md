Output State: **`rep` is 2, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Max`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of either `Min` or `Max`, and now includes the string representation of `Max`.**

Explanation: The code `number = Max` updates the value of `number` to be equal to `Max`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
