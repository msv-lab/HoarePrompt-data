Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True if `s[1]` is not equal to the character at index `n - 2` in string `s`, and `count` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `count2` is less than or equal to `count`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
