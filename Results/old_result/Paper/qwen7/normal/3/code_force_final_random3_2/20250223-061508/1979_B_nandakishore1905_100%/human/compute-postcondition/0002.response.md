Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the absolute difference between `n` and `m` to the variable `k`. Since `n` and `m` are inputs, their values remain unchanged. The variable `i` is also not affected, so its value remains 0. Therefore, `k` is now equal to the absolute value of the difference between `n` and `m`.
