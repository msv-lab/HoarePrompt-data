Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the function signature. However, the problem requires interacting with an external entity to query bitwise operations on a hidden permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \), which is a permutation of \(\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}\). The interaction involves making at most \(3n\) queries to determine the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '<':
            mak = i
    mak2 = mak
    pans = []
    for i in range(n):
        print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        s = str(input())
        if s == '<':
            mak = i
            pans = [i]
        elif s == '=':
            pans.append(i)
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, len(pans)):
        print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '>':
            mak = i
    print('!', mak2, mak)
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: mak is n + 2, mak2 is n - 1, i is n + 2, pans is a list containing the elements n - 1, n - 1, n, and s is the string '>', and sys.stdout.flush() has been executed multiple times.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `pans` is a list of length `n`, and `mak` is equal to `n-1` if the input string is '>' for every iteration from 1 to `n-1`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `pans` contains the original list of values from `n-1` down to `0`, `mak` is equal to `len(pans) - 1`, and no changes were made to the variables due to the `sys.stdout.flush()` command.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
