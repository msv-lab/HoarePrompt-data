Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `cnt` will be the total count of elements in `b` that are less than `a[i]` for each iteration of the outer loop. Since `i` is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration of the outer loop and incremented based on the comparison with elements of `b`, `cnt` accumulates the count of elements in `b` that are less than `a[i]` across all iterations. `i` will be equal to `n` after the inner loop completes for each iteration of the outer loop, indicating that either all elements in `b` were greater than or equal to `a[i]` or the last element in `b` that was less than `a[i]` was found. `j` will be `-1` as it is decremented from `n-1` to `-1`. `n` will remain unchanged, and `t` will be reduced by the number of iterations of the outer loop, which is equal to the initial value of `t`. `a` and `b` will retain their respective values from the last iteration of the outer loop.

In simpler terms, `cnt` will sum up the counts of elements in `b` that are less than `a[i]` for each iteration of the outer loop, `i` will be `n` after each iteration, `j` will be `-1`, `n` will stay the same, `t` will be reduced by the number of iterations, and `a` and `b` will keep their final values from the last iteration.
