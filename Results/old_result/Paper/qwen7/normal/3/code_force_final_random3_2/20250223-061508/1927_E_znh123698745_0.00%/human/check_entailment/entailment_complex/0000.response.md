Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to generate a k-level permutation of length n. A k-level permutation ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length k is at most 1.
2. **Analyze the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - It initializes an array `array` with numbers from 1 to n.
   - It starts with `answer` as `[1]`.
   - It uses a list `a` initialized as `[1, -1]` to keep track of indices for selecting elements from `array`.
   - The loop iterates from 1 to n-1, appending elements to `answer` based on the current value of `(-1)**i`. If `(-1)**i` is -1, it appends the element from `array[a[-1]]` and decrements `a[-1]`. Otherwise, it appends the element from `array[a[0]]` and increments `a[0]`.
   - After the loop, the `answer` list is printed.

3. **Verification of the Logic**:
   - The logic ensures that elements are selected alternately from the beginning and end of the `array`, which helps in maintaining the balance required for a k-level permutation.
   - Since k is even, the alternating selection helps in balancing the sums of continuous segments of length k.
   - The initial element is set to 1, ensuring that the sequence starts with the smallest possible value, which is beneficial for maintaining the k-level property.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the constraints correctly and ensures that the generated permutation meets the k-level condition.
   - The approach is efficient and works within the given constraints.

Conclusion:
The provided code correctly generates a k-level permutation for each test case as per the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **True**.
