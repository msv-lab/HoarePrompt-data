Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers, `i` is the next element in the list `palka`, `pl` is a list with one additional element which is `i`, `d[i]` is either set to 1 or incremented by 1 depending on its current value.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. This means that `pl` now contains all elements from `palka` plus the new element `i`. The condition regarding `d[i]` (if `d[i]` is `None`, then `d[i]` is set to 1; otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1) remains unchanged and is still applicable.
