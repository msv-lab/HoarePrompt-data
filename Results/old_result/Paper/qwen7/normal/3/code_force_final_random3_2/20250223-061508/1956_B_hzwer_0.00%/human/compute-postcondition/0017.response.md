Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j` is within the specified range, which is from `n-1` to `-1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `students_list` is a list of students
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `j` is `n-1`
   - `dp[i][j]` is equal to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]` if `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`; otherwise, `dp[i][j]` remains `dp[i + 1][j]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop decrements `j` by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be `n-2`.

5. **Other variables remain unchanged**:
   - `total` remains 0
   - `students_list` remains a list of students
   - `n` remains greater than 0
   - The condition for `dp[i][j]` remains the same but will be applied to the new value of `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`total` is 0, `students_list` is a list of students, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n-2`, and `dp[i][j]` is equal to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]` if `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`; otherwise, `dp[i][j]` remains `dp[i + 1][j]`**.
