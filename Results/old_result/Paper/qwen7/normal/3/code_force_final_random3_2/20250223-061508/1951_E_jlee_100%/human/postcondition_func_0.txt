The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` meets certain conditions and prints one of three possible outputs: "YES" followed by the number of operations needed to transform the string into a palindrome, or "NO" if no transformation can achieve the required condition. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
