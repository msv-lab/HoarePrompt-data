Output State: **`operational_list` is a non-empty list containing the split elements of the input string, excluding the first two elements; `x` is the third element in the list; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`; `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x`.**

Explanation: The code appends the reverse of `x` (as a string) to the list `rev_val`. The reverse of `x` is added as a string to `rev_val`, and none of the other variables (`operational_list`, `x`, `x_rev`) are affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
