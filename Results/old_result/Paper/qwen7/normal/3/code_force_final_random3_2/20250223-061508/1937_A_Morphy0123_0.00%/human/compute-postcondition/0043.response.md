Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n_cases`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n_cases`.

3. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `n_cases` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `i` is 2 (if it was 1) or `i + 1` (if it was the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `power` is either equal to `n` if `n` is 1, or `power` is 15 and `n` is greater than or equal to 16384.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is either 2 or `i + 1`, and the loop continues as long as `i < n_cases`, `i` will increase by 1 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - `n_cases` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `n_cases` remains the same.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n_cases` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is `i + 1` (if it was 2) or `i + 2` (if it was the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15), `n` is an input integer, and `power` is either equal to `n` if `n` is 1, or `power` is 15 and `n` is greater than or equal to 16384.**
