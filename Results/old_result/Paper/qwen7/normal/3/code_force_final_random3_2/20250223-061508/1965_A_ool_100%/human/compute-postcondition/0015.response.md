Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, len(set_)):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(set_)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `not_c` is False
   - `A` is True

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(set_)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Calculate the value of `len(set_)`**:
   - Since `i` was incremented from 1 to 2 (assuming the loop body did not change `i`), it means `len(set_)` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `len(set_)` must be at least 2.

Given this information, we can now update the state for the next iteration:

State: **`i` is 2, `not_c` is False, `A` is True, and `len(set_)` must be at least 2**
