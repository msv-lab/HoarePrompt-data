Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `pathb`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` computed during the loop iterations, and `curr` is the last computed value of `curr` within the loop.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be the index of the last element in `pathb`, `pres` will hold the sum of all elements in the `pathb` list, `ress` will contain the maximum value of `curr` computed during the loop iterations, and `curr` itself will represent the last computed value within the loop.
