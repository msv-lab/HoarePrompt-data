Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `a[2]` is yet to be determined, `b[2]` is yet to be determined, `sa` is a list containing the values 1 and 2, `sb` is a list containing the value 1.**

Explanation: The code `sa.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `sa`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `sa` now contains the values 1 and 2, while `i`, `n`, `a[2]`, `b[2]`, and `sb` retain their original states.
