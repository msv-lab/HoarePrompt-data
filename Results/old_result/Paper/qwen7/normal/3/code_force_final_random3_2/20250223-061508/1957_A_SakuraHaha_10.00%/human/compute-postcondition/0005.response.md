Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `cnt` is a dictionary with one entry where the key is `x` and the value is 1 (assuming `x` was previously not in the dictionary).**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `cnt` by incrementing the count of the key `x` by 1. Since `x` was not previously in the dictionary, `cnt.get(x, 0)` returns 0, and then 1 is added to it, resulting in the value 1 being stored for the key `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
