Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` will be the other value in the range (1 or 2), `sum` is increased by `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `r` is equal to `i`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sum` by adding the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2`. The value of `r` is set to `i`. The conditions and constraints on `t`, `n`, `i`, and the initial state of `sum` and `r` remain unchanged.
