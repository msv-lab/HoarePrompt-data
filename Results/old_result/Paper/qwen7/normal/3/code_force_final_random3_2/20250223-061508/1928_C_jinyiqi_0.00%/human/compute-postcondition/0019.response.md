Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is greater than or equal to the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to `x`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` from the largest divisor less than or equal to \(\sqrt{x}\) down to 1, `output2` is a list containing the corresponding quotients when `x` is divided by each divisor in `output1`.**

Explanation: The line `output1.reverse()` reverses the list `output1` in place. This means that the order of elements in `output1` is flipped, so the largest divisor of `x` (which was originally at the beginning of the list) is now at the start, and the smallest divisor (which was originally at the end) is now at the end. The values of `x`, `i`, `n`, and `output2` remain unchanged.
