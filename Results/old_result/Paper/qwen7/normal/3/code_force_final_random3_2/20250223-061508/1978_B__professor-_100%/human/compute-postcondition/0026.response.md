Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `n` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `a` is assigned the second integer from the input.
- `b` is assigned the third integer from the input.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
```

Let's break down the expression inside the `print` function:
1. `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2` calculates the sum of the first `b - a` integers.
2. `a * n` multiplies the second input integer `a` by the first input integer `n`.

Combining these, the expression computes the sum of the first `b - a` integers plus `a` multiplied by `n`.

Therefore, the output will be the result of this computation, where `b` and `a` are the third and second input integers respectively, and `n` is the first input integer.

Output: **int((input[2] - input[1]) * (input[2] - input[1] + 1) // 2 + input[1] * input[0])**
