Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `arr` is a list containing sorted elements starting with 1s followed by 26s, and it ends with the value of `lex`.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `k` must be less than 3.
   - `lex` is an integer.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The code snippet is `print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')`.

3. **Variable Values**:
   - Since `k` is 0, we need to determine the value of `arr[0]`.
   - According to the initial state, `arr` starts with 1s. Therefore, `arr[0]` is 1.

4. **Calculation**:
   - We substitute `arr[0]` into the expression `chr(arr[k] + 96)`.
   - This becomes `chr(1 + 96)`, which simplifies to `chr(97)`.

5. **Character Conversion**:
   - The ASCII value 97 corresponds to the character 'a'.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is the character 'a'.

Output: **a**
