Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values for \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) received by Vasya during the "first-k-th" position settling can be explained by the rules provided.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) must fit within the repeating pattern.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly calculates the total length of the settling cycle as \( y = n + x \).
   - It checks if \( y \) is even, which is necessary for the settling pattern to make sense.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find all divisors of \( q \) (which is \( y - 2 \) divided by 2) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly identifies divisors of \( q \) and their corresponding quotients.
   - It ensures that only divisors and quotients that meet the condition \( \geq x - 1 \) are included in the result list \( M \).

5. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic correctly calculates the potential values of \( k \) by finding the divisors of \( q \) and their corresponding quotients.
   - The logic handles the edge cases where \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) by adding additional divisors from another segment of the settling pattern.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where no valid \( k \) exists by printing 0.
   - The code correctly handles the case where multiple valid \( k \) exist by returning the count of such \( k \).

Based on the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
