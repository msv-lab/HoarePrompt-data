Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is the index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `i` and `n/2` among all indices `i` where the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` hold.
- If no such index exists, `ans` is `-1`.

Given this, the `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which could be any integer index that satisfies the conditions or `-1` if no such index exists.

Output: **ans (where ans is the index i that minimizes the absolute difference between i and n/2 among all indices i where the conditions left * 2 >= lsum and right * 2 >= rsum hold, or -1 if no such index exists)**
