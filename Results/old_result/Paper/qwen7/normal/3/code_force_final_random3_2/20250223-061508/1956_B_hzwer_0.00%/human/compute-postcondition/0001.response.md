Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and `cards` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and splits it into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This list is assigned to the variable `cards`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
