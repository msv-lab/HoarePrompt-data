Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is "0", `p` is 1, and `q` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The values of `i`, `k`, `l`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states.
