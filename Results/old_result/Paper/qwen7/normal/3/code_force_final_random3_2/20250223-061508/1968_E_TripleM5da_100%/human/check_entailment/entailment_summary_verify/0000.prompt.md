You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

For n=6 a possible arrangement is:

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        print(1, 1)
        print(1, 2)
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            print(i, i)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), and `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive). It prints a sequence of numbers starting with (1, 1) followed by (1, 2), and then a series of pairs (i, i) for `i` ranging from 3 to `n` (inclusive). After processing, the loop variable `i` equals `2 * n - 1`, and `n` must be at least 11 for the loop to run the maximum number of times. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, for \( n > 2 \), the program only prints the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2) and then a series of coordinates (i, i) from 3 to n. However, the problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances, and the given solution does not guarantee the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \( n \).

For example, consider \( n = 3 \). The optimal arrangement should include cells such as (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1) to achieve the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\), which is 3. However, the provided program only includes (1, 1) and (1, 2), leading to a smaller set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases and is thus incorrect.
