Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop `for j in range(1, n + 1):` will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. The variable `j` will take values from 1 to `n` inclusive.
3. **Adjust the states of the loop head variables**: 
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.
   - `j` will start from 1 and increment until it reaches `n`.

Given the initial states:
- `i` is 4
- `n` is 3
- `j` is 4
- `nx` is ''

We need to adjust the states of `j` and `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

### Adjusted States:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` must start from 1 (the first value in the range).

Since `n` is currently 3, which is greater than 1, the main concern is ensuring `j` starts from 1. Given that `j` is currently 4, it does not meet the requirement to start from 1.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 3, `j` must be 1, `nx` is ''**

This ensures that the loop can start executing with `j` set to 1 and `n` being 3, which is valid for the loop condition.
