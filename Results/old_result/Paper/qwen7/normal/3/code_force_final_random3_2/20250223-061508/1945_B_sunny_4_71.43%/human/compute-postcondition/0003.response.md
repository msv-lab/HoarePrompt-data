Output State: **`a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `A` is the value of `int(m / a) + 1`.**

This means that `A` is calculated as the integer division of `m` by `a` followed by adding 1 to the result. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
