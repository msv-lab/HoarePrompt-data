Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that the provided functions generate a valid solution for the problem statement. Let's break down the requirements and check if the functions meet them:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) to each vertex.
   - For every pair of vertices \((i, j)\), an edge is added if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The graph should be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques.
   - The output should include the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the partition of vertices into cliques.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - Calls `make_array` to fill the arrays `arr` and `cliquess`.
   - Prints the filled array `arr`, the number of cliques, and the array `cliquess`.

3. **Function `make_array`**:
   - Fills the array `arr` and `cliquess` based on the specified logic.
   - Ensures that the subarrays are filled with values that satisfy the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).

Let's analyze if these functions meet the requirements:

- **Distinct Values**: The function assigns distinct values from 1 to \( n \) to the vertices, which satisfies the requirement.
- **Edge Condition**: The `make_array` function ensures that the values are assigned in a way that the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is met for the pairs of vertices within the same clique.
- **Clique Partition**: The function creates a partition of the graph into the minimum number of cliques, which is achieved by filling the arrays in a way that groups vertices that satisfy the edge condition into the same clique.

Given the execution summaries and the logic of the functions, they appear to correctly implement the required solution. The `make_array` function ensures that the values are assigned in a manner that forms valid cliques according to the given condition.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
