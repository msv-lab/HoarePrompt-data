Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), the length of the strings (`n`), and the strings themselves (`a`, `b`, and `c`). This part is handled correctly.

2. **Template Matching Logic**:
   - The program iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - It checks if the characters at the same position in strings `a` and `b` are the same. If they are, it then checks if the character in `c` at the same position is different from `a[i]`. If so, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the characters in `a` and `b` at position `i` are different, it continues to the next iteration unless `c[i]` matches either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, in which case it skips to the next iteration.
   - If no conflicts are found, it sets `possible` to `True` after the loop.

3. **Output**:
   - If `possible` is `True` after processing all positions, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies when a template can be constructed such that `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic and produces the expected output for the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
