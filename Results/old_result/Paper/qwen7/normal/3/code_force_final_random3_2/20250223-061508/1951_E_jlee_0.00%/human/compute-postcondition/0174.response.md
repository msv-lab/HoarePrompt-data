Postcondition: `done` is True, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string, `n` is 1, `x` is the first character of the input string, `count` is updated to `j`, `count2` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` equals `count`, we continue checking the symmetry of the string; otherwise, `count2` is reset to 0.
