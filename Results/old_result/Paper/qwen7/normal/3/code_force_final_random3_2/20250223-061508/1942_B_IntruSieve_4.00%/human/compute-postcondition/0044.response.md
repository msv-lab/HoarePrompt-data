Postcondition: `minn` is either `maxx` + 1, `maxx` + 2, `maxx` + 3, or `maxx` + 4; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer; `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between each element in `arr` and `minn`, followed by `minn`, or an additional element which is `minn`; `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between `maxx` and `abs(arr[i] - minn)` if `abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`.
