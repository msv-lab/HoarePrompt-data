Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 0, `adv` is `min(a[1] - a[2] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `ans` contains `a[1] - j - 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a[1] - 0 - 1`, which is `a[1] - 1`. The value of `adv` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. The initial state of `i` and `j` also remains unchanged. Therefore, `ans` now contains the value `a[1] - 1`.
