Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, consider the following test case:

- Input:
```
5
3
1 1 2
2
1 2
1 3
```

- Expected Output:
```
2 3
1 2
```

However, the program's output is:
```
-1 -1
-1 -1
```

The issue arises because the program uses `bisect_left` to find the relevant segment in the `arr` list, but it does not properly handle the case where the segment boundaries do not exist within the query range. In the example above, for the query `1 3`, the segment `[1, 2]` is found, but since the segment ends at index 2 and the query range is up to index 3, the program incorrectly returns `-1 -1`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the segment boundaries are within the query range. Here is a corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (l, r) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
    (s, e, _) = arr[min(eli, LA)]
    
    # Ensure the segment is within the query range
    if s > l or e < l:
        print(-1, -1)
    elif s <= r and e >= l:
        if s == 1 or s > r:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            print(s - 1, s)
    else:
        print(-1, -1)
```

This ensures that only valid segments within the query range are considered, preventing the incorrect `-1 -1` outputs.
