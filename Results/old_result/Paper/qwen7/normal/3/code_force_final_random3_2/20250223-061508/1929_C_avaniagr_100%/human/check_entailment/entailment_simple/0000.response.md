Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given annotated program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the input from standard input (stdin) using `[*open(0)]`, which is a common way to read from stdin in Python. This part is correct.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program iterates over each test case, reading `k`, `x`, and `a` from the input. This is done correctly.

3. **Conditions for Printing 'YES' or 'NO'**:
   - **Case 1: \( x < k - 1 \)**:
     - If \( a \geq x + 1 \), the program prints 'YES'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
     - This condition is correctly implemented.
   
   - **Case 2: \( x = k - 1 \)**:
     - If \( a \geq x + 2 \), the program prints 'YES'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
     - This condition is correctly implemented.
   
   - **Case 3: \( x > k - 1 \)**:
     - The program calculates \( z \) using the formula:
       \[
       z = k - 2 + \left(\frac{z}{k - 1} + 1\right)
       \]
       where \( z \) is initialized to \( k - 2 \).
     - It then checks if \( a \geq z \) and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
     - This calculation and condition check are correctly implemented.

4. **Output State**:
   - The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions mentioned.
   - The final state of `[*open(0)]` will contain any remaining unprocessed lines of input, and the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` will reflect the last set of values read from the input.
   - This is correctly described.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
