Output State: **`q` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be an integer and `w >= x - 1`, `M` is a list containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and their corresponding quotients when divided into `q`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will iterate through all integers from 1 up to the largest integer less than `w` (inclusive). For each `i` that is a divisor of `q` and satisfies `i >= x - 1`, it and its corresponding quotient `q // i` (if it also meets the condition) are added to the list `M`. Therefore, `M` will contain all such divisors and their quotients.
