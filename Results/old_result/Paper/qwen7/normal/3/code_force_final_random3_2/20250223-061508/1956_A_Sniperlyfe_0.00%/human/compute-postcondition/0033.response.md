Output State: **`res` contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for every `n` in `qs`, `t` is decreased by 1, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers using `input().split()`, which splits the input into a list of strings. The `map(int, ...)` function then converts each string in the list to an integer, resulting in a list of integers. This list is assigned to the variable `p`. The other variables (`res`, `t`, `k`, and `q`) remain unchanged in terms of their values, but `p` now holds the new list of integers.
