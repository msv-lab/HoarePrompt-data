Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly describes the state of the program before and after the function calls.
2. The function `func_1()` processes each test case as follows:
   - It reads the size of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It identifies segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` and stores these segments along with their start and end indices in the list `arr`.
   - For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the relevant segment in `arr` and then checks the segment boundaries to determine if a valid pair of indices can be found within the query range `[l, r]`.
   - The logic for determining the valid pair of indices is sound and covers all possible cases (valid pair found, no valid pair found).
3. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly, which matches the problem statement's requirements.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the execution states provided.

Correctness: **True**
