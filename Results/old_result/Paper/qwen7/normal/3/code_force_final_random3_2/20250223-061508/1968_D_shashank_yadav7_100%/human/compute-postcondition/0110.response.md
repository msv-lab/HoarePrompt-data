Output State: **`p` is a list of integers from the input, `bm` is the maximum value it attained during any iteration of the loop; `s` is the result of `p[s] - 1` after the last iteration; `sm` is the maximum value it attained during any iteration of the loop; `sp` is the cumulative sum of `a[s]` after the last iteration; `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` after the last iteration; `b` is the result of `p[b] - 1` after the last iteration.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `p`. The other variables (`bm`, `s`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, `b`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
