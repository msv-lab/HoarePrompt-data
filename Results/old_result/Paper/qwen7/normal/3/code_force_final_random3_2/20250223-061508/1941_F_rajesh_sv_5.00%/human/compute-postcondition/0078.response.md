Postcondition: `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is the index such that all elements in the list `D` up to index `l` are less than or equal to `left - f`, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1` and `h` must be at least `l + 1`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum`.
