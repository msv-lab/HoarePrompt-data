Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove so that the array is no longer beautiful. The current implementation does not correctly identify when the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

Here’s why the provided solution is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Removals**: The code counts consecutive occurrences of the same element but does not consider the structure of the array needed to make it non-beautiful. It also doesn't handle the removal of elements to break the beauty condition properly.

2. **Set Usage**: Using `set(a)` to check for unique elements is unnecessary and does not help in determining the minimum number of removals required to make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Misinterpretation of Beauty Condition**: The solution does not correctly interpret the condition where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements. It only checks for consecutive identical elements and does not account for the specific pattern required to break the beauty condition.

### Correct Solution Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to track the longest sequence of elements that can be made identical by the given operation. The minimum number of removals would be the total length of the array minus the length of the longest such sequence.

Here’s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Track the longest sequence of identical elements
        max_length = 1
        current_length = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i] == a[i-1]:
                current_length += 1
                max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
            else:
                current_length = 1
        
        # If the entire array is identical, it cannot be made non-beautiful
        if max_length == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(n - max_length)

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution correctly identifies the longest sequence of identical elements and calculates the minimum number of removals required to break the beauty condition.
