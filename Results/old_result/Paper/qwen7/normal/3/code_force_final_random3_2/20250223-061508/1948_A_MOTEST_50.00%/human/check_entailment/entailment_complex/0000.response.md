Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the input format, where the first line contains the number of test cases `t`, and each subsequent line contains an integer `n`.
2. The program checks if `n` is 1, which is the condition where no suitable string can be formed, and prints "NO" accordingly.
3. For other values of `n`, the program attempts to construct a string with exactly `n` special characters.
4. The logic for constructing the string is as follows:
   - If `n` is even, it alternates between different characters from the uppercase alphabet until it reaches the required count.
   - If `n` is odd, it starts with 'AAA' and then alternates similarly.
5. The constructed string is printed along with "YES".
6. The program ensures that the length of the constructed string does not exceed 200, as per the problem constraints.
7. The program does not return any value but prints the required output for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the problem statement accurately and produces the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
