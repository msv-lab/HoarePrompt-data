Output State: The function `func_1()` has been called a total of int(input()) times.

Explanation: Given that the loop runs for a number of times specified by the user input, and `func_1()` is called within this loop for each iteration, the final output state will be that `func_1()` has been called exactly equal to the number provided by the user as input. Since the problem does not specify any changes to the function or its parameters within the loop, and no other variables are mentioned as being affected by the loop, the only state change is the number of times `func_1()` has been executed.
