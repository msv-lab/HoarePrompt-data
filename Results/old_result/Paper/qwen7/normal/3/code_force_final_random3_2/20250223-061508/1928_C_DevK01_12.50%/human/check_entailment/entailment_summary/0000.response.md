Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to find the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and the number \( x \) received by Vasya during the settling can be explained by the described pattern.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, with the first \( k \) positions being \( 1, 2, \ldots, k \), the next \( k-2 \) positions being \( k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \), and so on.

2. **Key Observations from the Execution Summary**:
   - The function `func_1(q, x)` is supposed to calculate the divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \) and their corresponding quotients.
   - The main logic in the program seems to involve checking the divisors of a derived value related to \( n \) and \( x \).

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is even. If not, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` to get potential values of \( k \).
   - If \( n \geq 3x - 2 \), it also calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to consider additional potential values of \( k \).
   - The results are stored in a set to remove duplicates and the length of the set is printed as the number of valid \( k \) values.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function correctly identifies the divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \) and their corresponding quotients.
   - The logic to check divisors and their quotients is sound and matches the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of possible \( k \) values based on the given constraints and the described settling pattern.

Correctness: **True**
