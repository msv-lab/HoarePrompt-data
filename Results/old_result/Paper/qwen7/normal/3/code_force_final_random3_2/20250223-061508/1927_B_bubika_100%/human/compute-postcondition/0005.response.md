Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `b` is a list of 26 zeros; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer; `r` is an empty string.**

The code initializes an empty string `r`. None of the other variables (`t`, `b`, `n`, `s`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, they retain their initial states.
