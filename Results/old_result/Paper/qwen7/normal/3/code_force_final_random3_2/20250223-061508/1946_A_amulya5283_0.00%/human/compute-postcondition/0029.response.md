Output State: **`operations` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a slice of `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end.**

Explanation: The line `heap = arr[median_index:]` assigns a slice of the array `arr` starting from the `median_index` (which is `n // 2`) to the end of the array to the variable `heap`. All other variables remain unchanged.
