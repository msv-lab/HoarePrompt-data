Based on the initial state provided:

- `[*open(0)]` is a list with at least 2 elements.
- `k` is the first integer from the third element of `[*open(0)]` split by spaces.
- `x` is the second integer from the third element of `[*open(0)]` split by spaces.
- `a` is the third integer from the third element of `[*open(0)]` split by spaces.
- `s` is the third element of `[*open(0)]`.
