Output State: **`h1` is '01', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'PM', and `h` is '13'.**

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. This updates the value of `time` but does not affect the values of `h1`, `m1`, or `h`. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `h1`, `m1`, and `h` from the initial state while updating `time` to `'PM'`.
