You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

Output

    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

All other variables (`a`, `a_temp`, and `i`) will be as follows: `i` will be equal to `len(a_new)`, `a` and `a_temp` will retain their initial values but modified according to the loop's effect, and `a_new` will contain the updated values as described.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, each element in `a_new` (starting from the second element) will have subtracted from it the cumulative sum of all previous elements in `a_temp`. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `a_new`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements. The initial lists `a` and `a_temp` will still exist but will reflect the changes made during the loop's execution on `a_new`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to relate to the game rules at all. Specifically:

- `func_1` appears to be sorting and modifying a list of integers, but this has no relevance to the game logic.
- `func_2` seems to be a recursive function that returns 1 or 2, but it does not take into account the game rules where players remove a positive integer `k` that is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to simulate the game moves and determine the winner based on the game rules. Here’s a brief outline of how the correct solution might look:

1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the number of piles and the sizes of the piles.
   - Use the XOR operation on the sizes of the piles after removing the smallest pile size from each pile until the smallest pile size is 1. If the result is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

Since the provided code does not implement this logic, it cannot be considered correct.
