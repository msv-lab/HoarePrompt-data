Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `i` is 6.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs from `0` to `int(input()) - 1`.
   - This means the loop will continue as long as `i < int(input())`.

3. **Current Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 6.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `int(input())`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 6, for the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must be greater than 6.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 6 to ensure the loop continues.

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `t` remains unchanged since it is not affected by the loop.
- `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, so it will be 7.
- `n` must be greater than 6 to allow the loop to execute one more time.

Thus, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 7, `n` must be greater than 6.**
