Output State: **`max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `x` must be greater than 2, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `y`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are reassigned or modified by the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged.
