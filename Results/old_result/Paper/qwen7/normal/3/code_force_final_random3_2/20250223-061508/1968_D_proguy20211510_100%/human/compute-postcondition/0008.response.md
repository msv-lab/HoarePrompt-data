Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `MOD` is 1000000007, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original `n` string to an integer, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original `k` string to an integer, `pb` is an integer obtained from converting the original `pb` string to an integer, `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original `ps` string to an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting another input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes two empty lists `pathb` and `paths`. It does not modify the values of any existing variables, nor does it introduce new variables or perform any operations that would change the values of the existing ones. Therefore, the values of `t`, `MOD`, `alpha`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
