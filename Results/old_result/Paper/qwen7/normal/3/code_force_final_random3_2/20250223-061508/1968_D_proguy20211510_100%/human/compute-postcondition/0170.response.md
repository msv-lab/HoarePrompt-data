Output State: **`preb` is 0, `pres` is 0, `pathb` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `curr` is `pathb[0] * k`.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is assigned the value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. Given the initial state where `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0, `pathb` is a list with at least one element, `i` is 0, and since `k < i + 1` breaks the most internal loop or if statement, the term `(k - i)` is simply `k` because `i` is 0. Thus, `curr` is calculated as `0 + pathb[0] * k`, which simplifies to `pathb[0] * k`. The values of `preb`, `pres`, `pathb`, and `i` remain unchanged.
