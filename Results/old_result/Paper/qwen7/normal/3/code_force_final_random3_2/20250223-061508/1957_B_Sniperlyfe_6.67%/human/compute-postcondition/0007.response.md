Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `n` is greater than 0
  - `i` is 1
  - `k` is `k - 2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for i in range(n):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

2. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust the values of `i` and `n`.

3. **Incrementing `i`:**
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, the new value of `i` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.

4. **Condition for `n`:**
   - `n` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue executing.

5. **Value of `k`:**
   - The value of `k` is given as `k - 2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
   - This expression does not change the value of `k` directly; it is used in the loop body but not in the loop head.

### Conclusion:
- The only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.
- `i` will be incremented to 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is `k - 2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`**
