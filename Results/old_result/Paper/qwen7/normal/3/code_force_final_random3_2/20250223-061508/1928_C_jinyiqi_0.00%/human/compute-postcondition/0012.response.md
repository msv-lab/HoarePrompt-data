Postcondition: `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `output1` is a list containing 1 and 3, `output2` is a list containing the integer value of `x / 2` and the integer value of `x / 3`. If `x` is divisible by 3, both 3 and `x / 3` are added to `output1` and `output2` respectively. If `x` is not divisible by 3, the lists remain unchanged.
