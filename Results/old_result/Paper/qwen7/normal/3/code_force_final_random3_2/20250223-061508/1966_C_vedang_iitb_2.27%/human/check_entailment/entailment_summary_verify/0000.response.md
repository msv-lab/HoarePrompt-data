### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summaries to evaluate the correctness of the solution.

#### Function 1: `func_1`
```python
def func_1(a):
    a_new = sorted(list(set(a)))
    a_temp = a_new.copy()
    for i in range(1, len(a_new)):
        a_new[i] = a_new[i] - a_temp[i - 1]
    return a_new
```
This function takes a list `a` and performs the following operations:
1. Converts the list to a set to remove duplicates.
2. Sorts the unique elements.
3. Modifies the sorted list by subtracting the previous element from the current one.

This function does not seem to have any relation to the game logic described in the problem statement. It is not used in the main logic of the program.

#### Function 2: `func_2`
```python
def func_2(a, n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        if a[0] % 2 == 0:
            return 1
        else:
            return 2
    else:
        winNext = func_2(a[1:], n - 1)
        if winNext == 2 or (winNext == 1 and a[0] != 1):
            return 1
        else:
            return 2
```
This function is a recursive function that determines whether the player who starts the game can guarantee a win based on the current configuration of stone piles. However, the logic inside the function does not match the game rules:
- The base cases handle very specific scenarios (n=1 and n=2).
- The recursive call `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)` suggests that the function is trying to determine the outcome for a smaller subset of piles, but the conditions inside the function do not correctly reflect the game rules.

#### Main Logic
The main logic of the program is not provided, but based on the function summaries, it seems the program is supposed to use `func_2` to determine the winner. However, the logic within `func_2` is flawed and does not correctly simulate the game.

#### Correct Solution Outline
A correct solution would involve:
1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the number of piles and the sizes of the piles.
   - Use the XOR operation on the sizes of the piles after removing the smallest pile size from each pile until the smallest pile size is 1. If the result is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the game logic. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not align with the game rules, and the main logic is missing.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement.
