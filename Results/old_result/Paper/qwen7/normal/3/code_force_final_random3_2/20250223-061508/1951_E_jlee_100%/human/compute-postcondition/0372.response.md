Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `done` is `True`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `not done` is true.
   - Given that `done` is `True`, the loop will not execute again because `not True` is `False`.

3. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `t`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop condition `not done` is false, the loop will not execute again.
   - Therefore, no changes are needed for `i` or `t` to make the loop execute one more time.

5. **Final State:**
   - The states of `done` and `i` remain unchanged because the loop does not execute again.

**Answer:**
State: **`done` is `True`, `i` is `n-1`**
