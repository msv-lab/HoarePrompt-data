Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `paths`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `pathb` is a list, `len(paths)` is a constant, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `curr` is `pres + paths[length_of_paths] * (k - length_of_paths)`, `ress` is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, so `i` equals the length of `paths`. The variable `preb` now holds the sum of all elements in `pathb` because each element in `paths` has been added to `pres` exactly once. `pres` itself is the sum of all elements in `paths`. The variable `curr` is calculated as the last possible value when `k` is just greater than or equal to the length of `paths`. Finally, `ress` contains the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the `curr` values computed during the loop iterations.
