Output State: **`same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is infinity, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

The code `i = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `i`. This does not affect any other variables or their states. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the updated value of `i`.
