Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `eli` is the updated index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`.
   - `s` is the start value of the tuple at the `min(eli, LA)` index.
   - `e` is the end value of the tuple at the `min(eli, LA)` index.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `l` is an integer from the input split.
   - `r` is an integer from the input split.
   - `s` is assigned the start value of the tuple at the `min(eli, LA)` index.
   - `e` is assigned the end value of the tuple at the `min(eli, LA)` index.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(s - 1, s)
   ```

Given the initial state, we need to determine the values of `s` and then compute `s - 1` and `s`.

- Since `s` is explicitly defined as the start value of the tuple at the `min(eli, LA)` index, and there is no further information about `LA`, we assume `LA` is the length of `arr` (since it is a common assumption in such problems if not specified otherwise).
- Therefore, `s` is the start value of the tuple at the `min(eli, len(arr))` index.

Since `s` is the start value of the tuple, let's denote the tuple at the `min(eli, len(arr))` index as `(x, 0, 0)`, where `x` is the start value. Hence, `s = x`.

Now, we need to print `s - 1` and `s`:
- `s - 1` will be `x - 1`.
- `s` will be `x`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **x - 1, x** (where `x` is the start value of the tuple at the `min(eli, len(arr))` index).
