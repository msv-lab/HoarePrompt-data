Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is 10^9 except `ans[i]` which is now `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` where `i` is `n - 5`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, where `i` is `n - 4`. This means `ans[n - 5]` is updated to `ans[n - 4] - arr[n - 5]`. All other elements in the `ans` list remain `10^9`. The value of `n` and the contents of `arr` remain unchanged.
