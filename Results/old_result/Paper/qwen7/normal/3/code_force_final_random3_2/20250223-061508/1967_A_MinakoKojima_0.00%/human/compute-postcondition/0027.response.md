Output State: **`ans` is updated to its current value multiplied by `a[1] - a[0]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by multiplying it with the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i-1]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the code calculates `ans *= a[1] - a[0]`. After this operation, `i` is incremented to 2 (though not explicitly shown in the code snippet, it's implied by the problem context), and `n` must still be greater than 1 as per the initial condition.
