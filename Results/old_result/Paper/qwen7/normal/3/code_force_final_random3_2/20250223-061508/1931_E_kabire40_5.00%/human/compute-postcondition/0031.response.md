Output State: **`x` is 1, `val_in` is the element at index 1 in `rev_val`.**

Explanation: The code `val_in = rev_val[x]` assigns the element at index `x` in the list `rev_val` to the variable `val_in`. Given that `x % 2` is not equal to 0, `x` must be an odd number. Since the initial state specifies that `x` is 0 (an even number), and considering the condition `x % 2 != 0`, `x` must be updated to the next odd number, which is 1. Therefore, `val_in` will hold the element at index 1 in `rev_val`.
