Output: **YES**

Explanation: Based on the initial state provided:
- `no_path` remains `False`.
- `k` is set to `n-1`.
- `n` is an integer greater than `1`.
- For all `k` in the sequence `1, 3, 5, ..., n-1`, the value of `a[k]` is not `'>'`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. Since none of the variables or objects involved in the print statement are used in its content, the output is directly the string `'YES'`.
