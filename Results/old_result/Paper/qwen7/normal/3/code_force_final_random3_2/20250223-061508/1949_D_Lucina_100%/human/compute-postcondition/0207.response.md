Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 5, `nx` is 'S', `j` is 5, and `n` is 4**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the string `'S'` to the end of the current value of `nx`. Given the initial state, `nx` is either the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` if it is not '?', or 'F' or 'S' if it is '?'. Since the exact value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not specified, we assume it could be either 'F' or 'S'. However, since the operation only appends 'S', the new value of `nx` will be 'S'. All other variables remain unchanged.
