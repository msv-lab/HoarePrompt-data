Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `MOD` is 1000000007, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original `n` string to an integer, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original `k` string to an integer, `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original `ps` string to an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting another input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `[a[pb - 1]]`, `paths` is an empty list, and `vis[pb - 1]` remains 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to the list `pathb`. Therefore, `pathb` now contains the element `a[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
