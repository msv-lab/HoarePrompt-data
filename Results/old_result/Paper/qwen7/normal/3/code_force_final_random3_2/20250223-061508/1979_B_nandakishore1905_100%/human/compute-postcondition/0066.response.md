Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `m` is an input integer
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`
   - `l` is "0"
   - `p` is the length of the binary string representation of `f - 2`
   - `q` is 1 if `k` is a power of 2, otherwise `l` is the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `f` is 0.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
   - `n` remains the same as it was an input integer and does not change within the loop.
   - The other variables (`m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, `q`, and `f`) do not affect the loop condition and thus remain unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer**
