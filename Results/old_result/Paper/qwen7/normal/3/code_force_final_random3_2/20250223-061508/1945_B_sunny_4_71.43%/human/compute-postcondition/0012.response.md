Output State: **`a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `t` is greater than 0, `b` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `B` is the value of `int(m / b) + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are reassigned to the values of three integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The values of `t`, `B`, and the initial values of `b` and `m` remain unchanged.
