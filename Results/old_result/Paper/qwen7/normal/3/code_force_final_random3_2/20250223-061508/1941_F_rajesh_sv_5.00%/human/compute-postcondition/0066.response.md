Postcondition: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is the final index calculated based on the condition inside the loop, `h` is the final value determined by the loop's termination condition, and `l` is the final index which is the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F`. The current value of `l` is equal to `h`.**
