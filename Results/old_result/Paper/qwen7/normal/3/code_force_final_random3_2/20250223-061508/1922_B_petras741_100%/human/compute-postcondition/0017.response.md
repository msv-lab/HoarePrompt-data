Output State: **`eta` is [0], `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and the current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` (which is 0) to the list `eta`. This changes the value of `eta` from an empty list to a list containing 0. The values of `j`, `n`, and the condition on `q[j]` remain unchanged.
