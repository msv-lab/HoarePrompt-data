The provided function `generate` does not seem to directly relate to the problem description of determining how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints. Instead, it appears to be part of a different problem involving prime factors and generating numbers based on those factors. Therefore, I will focus on extracting the precondition based on the problem description and the input variables provided.

Given the problem description and the input variables in the test cases, here is the precondition:

**Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Each test case consists of two integers n and x such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9.
