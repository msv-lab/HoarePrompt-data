Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The code `func_2()` is called, but since no changes to variables are made within the function call itself (no assignments or operations on `t` are shown), the value of `t` remains unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 1 is still valid after the function call.
