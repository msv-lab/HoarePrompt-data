Postcondition: `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user; `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Bob' based on whether `clues[1] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2] - clues[4]` and `clues[3] - clues[5]`. If the condition in the if statement is true, `answers` contains 'Draw' or 'Bob' as per the specified logic. If the condition in the if statement is false, `answers` is set to 'Draw' if `clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` is true, otherwise `answers` is set to 'Bob'.
