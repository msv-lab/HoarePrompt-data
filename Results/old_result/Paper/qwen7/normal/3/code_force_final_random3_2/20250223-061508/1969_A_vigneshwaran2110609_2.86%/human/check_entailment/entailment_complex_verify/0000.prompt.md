You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)

            print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; p is a list of n integers where each integer p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has completed all its iterations without breaking out of the inner if statement. This means that for every iteration of the outer loop, the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` was never met for any `i` in the range of `x`. Therefore, the value printed for each iteration was 3, indicating that the condition was not satisfied. After all iterations, the final values of `i` will be 49, `x` will be 50, and `n` will still be within the range of 2 to 50 (inclusive). The variable `flag` will remain unchanged from its initial state or will be False since it was never set to True during the loop's execution.
    #
    #The output state after the loop executes all iterations can be described as follows:
    #- `i` is 49
    #- `x` is 50
    #- `n` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive)
    #- `flag` is False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list `p` of `n` integers (each `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ `n`, `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct). For each test case, it reads `n` integers and checks if the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` holds for any `i` in the range of `x`. If the condition is met for any `i`, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop. If the condition is never met for any `i`, it prints `3`. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the final values of `i` (which will be 49), `x` (which will be 50), and `n` (which remains within the range 2 to 50), and sets `flag` to `False` if it was never set to `True` during the loop's execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the cases where no pair of friends are each other's best friends. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
3
2
2 1
```

In this case, there are only two friends, and each is the best friend of the other. According to the problem description, Monocarp needs to send invitations to both friends so that at least two friends come to the party. However, the program prints `2` in this case, which is incorrect because sending invitations to only one friend would suffice (since both friends will come if either receives an invitation).

The program should check if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and handle the case where no such pair exists separately.
