The function accepts a dictionary `nodes`, an integer `start`, and an optional integer `parent`. The dictionary `nodes` represents a graph where keys are nodes and values are lists of neighbors. The function returns either a list containing a single element 0 if the starting node has only one neighbor which is the parent, or a list of all possible path lengths from the starting node to every other node in the graph, incremented by 1 for each step taken away from the starting node.
