Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in array`. The only variable directly involved in the loop condition is `j`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is a string where the last character is 's'.
   - The character at index `j-2` in `ans` is 'b'.
   - `j` is increased by 1.
   - The character at index `j-1` in `ans` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is increased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `j` will start from the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.
   - The character at index `j-2` in `ans` remains 'b' because `j` is only incremented, not decremented.
   - The character at index `j-1` in `ans` is incremented by 1, so for the next iteration, this character will be the next character in the alphabet (assuming it was a letter).

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `j` will start from its current value plus 1.
- The character at index `j-2` in `ans` will still be 'b'.
- The character at index `j-1` in `ans` will be the next character in the alphabet after the one it was previously.

Since the exact value of `j` and the specific character at `j-1` depend on the previous state, we can generalize the new state as follows:

State: **`ans` is a string where the last character is 's', the character at index `j-2` in `ans` is 'b', and the character at index `j-1` in `ans` is the next character in the alphabet after the one it was previously.**
