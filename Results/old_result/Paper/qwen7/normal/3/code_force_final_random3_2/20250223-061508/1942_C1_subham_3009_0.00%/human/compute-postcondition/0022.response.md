Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `__name__` is `__main__`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers where each element is the integer from the input corresponding to its index, and `t` is reduced to 0 after being decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.
