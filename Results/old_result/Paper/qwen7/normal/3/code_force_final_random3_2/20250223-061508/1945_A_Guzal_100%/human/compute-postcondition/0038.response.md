Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three non-negative integers (a, b, and c) representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. For each test case, it calculates a value k based on the given conditions. If the value of a is outside the range 1 to 10^4, it prints an error message. Otherwise, it computes k as the sum of a plus one-third of (b + c) rounded down, plus one if (b + c) is not divisible by 3. It then prints the computed value k for each test case.**
