Postcondition: **`minn` is either `maxx` + 2 or `maxx` + 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between each element in `arr` and `minn`, followed by `minn`, and `maxx` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If `minn` equals `maxx`, the conditions for `minn`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `mex`, and `maxx` remain as described in the precondition, and `i` is incremented by 1. Since there is no else part, the conditions for `minn` and `maxx` do not change regardless of the value of `minn` compared to `maxx`.
