Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to relate to the game rules at all. Specifically:

- `func_1` appears to be sorting and modifying a list of integers, but this has no relevance to the game logic.
- `func_2` seems to be a recursive function that returns 1 or 2, but it does not take into account the game rules where players remove a positive integer `k` that is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to simulate the game moves and determine the winner based on the game rules. Hereâ€™s a brief outline of how the correct solution might look:

1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the number of piles and the sizes of the piles.
   - Use the XOR operation on the sizes of the piles after removing the smallest pile size from each pile until the smallest pile size is 1. If the result is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

Since the provided code does not implement this logic, it cannot be considered correct.
