Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `cnt` is an input integer, `tmp` retains its initial value, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list `a`. The values of `ans`, `cnt`, `tmp`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
