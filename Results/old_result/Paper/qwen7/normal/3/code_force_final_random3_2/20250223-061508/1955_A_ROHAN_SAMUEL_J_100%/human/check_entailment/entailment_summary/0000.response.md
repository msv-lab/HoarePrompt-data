Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the `func` function matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Analysis:

1. **Test Case Handling**:
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases using a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   
2. **Odd Number of Yogurts (`n % 2 == 1`)**:
   - The function checks if the number of yogurts \( n \) is odd.
   - It then checks if \( 2a < b \).
     - If \( 2a < b \), it is cheaper to buy each yogurt individually at price \( a \), so it prints \( a \times n \).
     - Otherwise, it uses the promotion to buy pairs of yogurts at price \( b \) and buys the remaining yogurt at price \( a \). This is calculated as \( \frac{n}{2} \times b + a \).

3. **Even Number of Yogurts (`n % 2 == 0`)**:
   - The function checks if the number of yogurts \( n \) is even.
   - It then checks if \( 2a < b \).
     - If \( 2a < b \), it is cheaper to buy each yogurt individually at price \( a \), so it prints \( a \times n \).
     - Otherwise, it uses the promotion to buy pairs of yogurts at price \( b \). This is calculated as \( \frac{n}{2} \times b \).

### Edge Cases:
- The function correctly handles both even and odd values of \( n \).
- It correctly compares \( 2a \) with \( b \) to decide the optimal strategy.
- The logic ensures that the minimum cost is always chosen based on the given conditions.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to calculate the minimum cost for buying \( n \) yogurts under the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
