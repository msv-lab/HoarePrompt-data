Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `bm` is max(`bm`, `a[b] * 0 + bp`), `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] * k + sp`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]**.

Explanation: The code `bp += a[b]` increments the value of `bp` by `a[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
