Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the optimal position `i` for laying the road such that at least half of the residents on both sides are satisfied. This involves checking the balance of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides of each potential position `i`.
- Function `func_1()` correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position `i` for each test case. It iterates through all possible positions `i` from 0 to `n` and checks if the current position satisfies the conditions for being the optimal position.
- Function `func_2()` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.
- Both functions together correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
