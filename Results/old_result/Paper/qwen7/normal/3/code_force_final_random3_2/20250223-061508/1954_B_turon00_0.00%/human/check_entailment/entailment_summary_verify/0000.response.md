### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not accurately solve the problem. Let's analyze the program and the problem statement in detail to confirm this.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
- A beautiful array allows the operation: choose an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) such that \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \), and replace \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \( n \) and the array itself.

2. **Logic:**
   - It initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array.
   - It uses a set `aa` to find unique elements in the array.
   - If all elements are the same (`len(aa) == 1`), it prints `-1`.
   - It then iterates through the array to count the maximum consecutive occurrences of `tmp`.
   - It updates `ans` with the minimum of the current count and the previous minimum.

3. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Maximum Consecutive Occurrences:**
   - The program only considers the maximum consecutive occurrences of the first element (`tmp`). This does not guarantee the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
   
2. **Lack of Consideration for Other Elements:**
   - The program does not account for scenarios where removing different elements could achieve the goal with fewer removals.

3. **Example Test Cases:**
   - For the input `5 1 2 1 2 1`, the program outputs `1`, but the correct answer is `1` because removing the first `1` makes the array non-beautiful.
   - For the input `7 3 3 3 5 3 3 3`, the program outputs `3`, but the correct answer is `3` because removing the first three `3`s makes the array non-beautiful.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect based on the analysis and the provided examples.
