Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input parameters for each test case.
2. It initializes the paths for Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions using the permutation.
3. The program calculates the maximum possible scores for both players by considering the paths they can take within the given number of turns `k`.
4. The logic for calculating the scores seems correct, as it considers the cumulative score based on the number of turns remaining.
5. The program correctly compares the final scores and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

Given the execution summary and the provided reasoning, the program appears to be implementing the logic correctly according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
