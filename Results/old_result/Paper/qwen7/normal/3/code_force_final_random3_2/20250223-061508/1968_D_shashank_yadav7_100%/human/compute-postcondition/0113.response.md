Output State: **`p` is a list of integers from the input, `bm` is the maximum value it attained during any iteration of the loop, `s` is now `p[s] - 2`, `sm` is the maximum value it attained during any iteration of the loop, `sp` is the cumulative sum of `a[s]` after the last iteration, `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` after the last iteration, `b` is `p[b] - 2`, `a` is now a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation: The value of `s` is decremented by 1. Since `s` was previously defined as `p[s] - 1`, the new value of `s` is now `p[s] - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
