Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still 0. The initial state of `n` being a non-negative integer is preserved, but since no specific value for `n` was provided, it is not included in the output state.
