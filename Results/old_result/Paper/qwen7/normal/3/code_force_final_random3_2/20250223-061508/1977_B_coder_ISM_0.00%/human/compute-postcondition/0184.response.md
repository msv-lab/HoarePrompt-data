Output State: **`i` is 29, `nalla` is 31, `flag` is 1, `s[29]` is '0', `s[30]` is '1', `s[31]` is '1'**

The code `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Initially, `s[29]` is `'0'` and `s[30]` is `'1'`. After appending `'1'` to the list, the length of `s` increases by one, and `s[31]` is set to `'1'`. The values of `i`, `nalla`, and `flag` remain unchanged.
