Output State: **`i` is an integer such that \((-1\) raised to the power of `i` equals -1\); `answer` is a list with one additional element which is `array[a[-1]]`.**

Explanation: The initial condition states that \((-1\) raised to the power of `i` equals -1, which means `i` must be an odd integer. The code snippet appends `array[a[-1]]` to the list `answer`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state includes the updated `answer` list and retains the original condition for `i`.
