Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `i` is equal to `n-2`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, the new value of `i` will be `n-2 + 1 = n-1`.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - With `i` now being `n-1`, the loop will continue if `n-1 < n`, which is always true.

6. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be `n-1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged (it must still be at least 2).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is equal to `n-1`**
