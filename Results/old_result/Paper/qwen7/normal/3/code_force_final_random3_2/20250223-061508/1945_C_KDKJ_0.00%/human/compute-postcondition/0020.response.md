Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string of length `n-1` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the current character in the string `a`; `x` is the last element of the list `S[1]` plus 1; `y` is the last element of the list `S[0]`; `S` is now `[S[0], S[1], [x, y]]`**

Explanation: The code `x, y = S[-1]` unpacks the last element of the list `S`, which is `[x, y]`, into the variables `x` and `y`. Since `S[-1]` is the last element of the list `S`, which is `[x, y]`, `x` is set to the last element of the list `S[1]` plus 1, and `y` is set to the last element of the list `S[0]`. The values of `a`, `s`, and the rest of the elements in `S` remain unchanged.
