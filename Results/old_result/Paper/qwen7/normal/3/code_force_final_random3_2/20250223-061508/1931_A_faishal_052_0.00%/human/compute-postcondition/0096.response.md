Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `j` is 2.
   - `k` is 1.
   - `arr` is a sorted list containing the elements `[lex, ...]`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The value of `k` is 1.
   - Therefore, `arr[k]` refers to the element at index 1 of the list `arr`.
   - Since `arr` is a sorted list and the first element is `lex`, the second element (at index 1) must be the next lexicographical element after `lex`. Given the nature of lexicographical order, the next element would be `py` if `arr` contains only these two elements.
   - Adding 96 to the ASCII value of `py` will convert it to its corresponding character in the range of lowercase letters (since 'a' is ASCII 97, 'b' is 98, etc.).
   - `chr(112 + 96)` calculates to `chr(208)`, but since the ASCII table does not have a character at 208, this should be interpreted as the character corresponding to the ASCII value of 112, which is 'p'.

Therefore, the code will print the character 'p'.

Output: **p**
