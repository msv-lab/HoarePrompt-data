Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(1, n):` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is multiplied by `a[1] - a[0]`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (greater than 1).

5. **Update the state**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged because the multiplication operation happens inside the loop body, but we don't know its exact value yet.
   - `i` is incremented to 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` is multiplied by `a[1] - a[0]`, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1**.
