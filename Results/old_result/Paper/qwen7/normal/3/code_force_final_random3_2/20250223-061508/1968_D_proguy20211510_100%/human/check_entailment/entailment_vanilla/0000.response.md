Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the input for `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` using `input().split()` and converts them to integers.
   - It also correctly parses the permutations `p` and the scores `a`.

2. **Path Calculation for Bodya and Sasha:**
   - The program initializes two lists `pathb` and `paths` to store the scores Bodya and Sasha will accumulate, respectively.
   - It uses a `vis` list to keep track of visited indices to avoid infinite loops.
   - The while loops correctly simulate the movement of Bodya and Sasha through the permutation, appending their scores to `pathb` and `paths`.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the maximum possible score for Bodya and Sasha separately.
   - It iterates through the paths and accumulates the scores up to `k` turns, ensuring it doesn't exceed the number of turns.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - The program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result (`Bodya`, `Sasha`, or `Draw`).

### Detailed Verification

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The input handling is correct and consistent with the problem statement.

2. **Path Simulation:**
   - The path simulation for both players is correct. The `vis` list ensures that the same index is not revisited, preventing infinite loops.

3. **Score Accumulation:**
   - The score accumulation logic is correct. The program correctly simulates the movement and score accumulation for each player.

4. **Final Comparison:**
   - The comparison logic is correct. The program correctly determines the winner based on the accumulated scores.

### Edge Cases and Special Considerations

- **Large Inputs:** The program handles large inputs efficiently due to the use of lists and simple arithmetic operations.
- **Edge Cases:** The program should handle edge cases such as when `k` is less than the length of the path, which it does correctly by breaking out of the loop early.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description.

**Correctness: **True**
