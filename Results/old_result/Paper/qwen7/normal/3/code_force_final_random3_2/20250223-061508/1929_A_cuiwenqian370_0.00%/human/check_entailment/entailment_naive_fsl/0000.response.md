Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The issue lies in the rearrangement logic within the `func_1` function. Specifically, the program alternates between the smallest and largest remaining elements, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array.

To illustrate, consider the following input:

```
3
4
10 5 15 20
```

The expected output should be 30 because we can rearrange the array to `[10, 20, 5, 15]`, resulting in a beauty of `(20-10) + (5-20) + (15-5) = 10 + (-15) + 10 = 5`.

However, the current implementation will sort the array and then alternate between the smallest and largest elements, resulting in an incorrect rearrangement. For the above example, the program would rearrange the array to `[5, 15, 10, 20]`, leading to a beauty of `(15-5) + (10-15) + (20-10) = 10 - 5 + 10 = 15`.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and thus is incorrect.
