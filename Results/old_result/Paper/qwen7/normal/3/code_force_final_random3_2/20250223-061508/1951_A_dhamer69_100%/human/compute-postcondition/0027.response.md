Based on the initial state provided:

- `start` and `end` are integers.
- `t` is an integer greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input string from the user.
- `n` is not equal to 2.
- `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s` and it is even.
- Either `s.count('11')` is not equal to 1 or `count_1` is not equal to 2.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

Given this, the print statement will output the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the other variables since the print statement itself does not depend on any of these variables.

Output: **YES**
