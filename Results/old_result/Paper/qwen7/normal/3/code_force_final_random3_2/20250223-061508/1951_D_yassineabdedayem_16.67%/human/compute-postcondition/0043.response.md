Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `rep` is `rep + 60`, `n` is `0`, `k` is `0`, `Min` is `0`, `Max` is `0`, `number` is `0`, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` after each iteration, which will have 60 elements.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `n != 0`, `k > 0`, `rep < 60`, and `n >= k`. Given that the loop executes up to 60 times (as specified by the condition `rep < 60`), and assuming `n` and `k` are adjusted appropriately within the loop body, `n` will eventually become 0 after 60 iterations. At this point, the loop terminates. Therefore, after all the iterations, `rep` will be 60, `n` will be 0, `k` will be 0, and `Min`, `Max`, and `number` will also be 0. The list `tab` will contain the string representations of `number` after each of the 60 iterations.
