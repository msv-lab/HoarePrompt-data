Output State: **`left` is an integer and it is increased by 1, `right` is decreased by 1, and `new_arr` is a list containing `arr[0]`, `arr[right]`, and `arr[left-1]` if `left` does not equal `right`, otherwise `new_arr` is a list containing `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `right -= 1` decreases the value of `right` by 1. The values of `left` and `new_arr` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `left` is still an integer and it is increased by 1, `right` is now one less than its original value (at least 2 since it was initially at least 3), and `new_arr` is defined based on the current values of `left` and `right`.
