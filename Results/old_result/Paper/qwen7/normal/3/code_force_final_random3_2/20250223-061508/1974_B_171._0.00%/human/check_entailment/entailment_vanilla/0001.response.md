Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num_cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the encoded string and the encoded string itself.
   
2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - This function takes an encoded string and returns the decoded string.
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `mapping` to store the reverse mapping of characters.
   - It also initializes an empty list `decoded` to store the decoded characters.
   - For each character in the encoded string:
     - If the character is already in the `mapping`, it appends the corresponding decoded character from the `mapping` to `decoded`.
     - Otherwise, it finds the next unused character in the alphabet (from 'a' to 'z') and maps it to the current encoded character.
     - It then appends this unused character to `decoded`.

3. **Constructing the Decoded String:**
   - The function joins the list `decoded` into a single string and returns it.

### Issues in the Given Program

1. **Incorrect Mapping Logic:**
   - The logic to find the next unused character in the alphabet is flawed.
   - The program tries to find the next unused character by iterating through the alphabet and checking if the character is not already in the values of the `mapping`. However, this approach does not correctly map the characters back to their original positions.
   - For example, if the encoded string is "serofedsoc", the mapping should be:
     - `s` -> `c`
     - `e` -> `o`
     - `r` -> `f`
     - `o` -> `d`
     - `f` -> `e`
     - `d` -> `r`
     - `c` -> `s`
   - But the current implementation does not correctly establish these mappings.

2. **Incorrect Decoding Process:**
   - The `decoded` list is populated with characters from the alphabet instead of the correct characters from the original string `s`.
   - The logic to find the correct character from the original string `s` based on the encoded string `encoded` is missing.

### Correct Approach

To correctly decode the string, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Create the Auxiliary String `r`:**
   - Construct the string `r` consisting of all distinct characters of the encoded string in alphabetical order.

2. **Reverse Mapping:**
   - Create a reverse mapping from `r` to the original characters.

3. **Decode the String:**
   - Use the reverse mapping to decode the encoded string.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline

if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        
        # Step 1: Create the auxiliary string r
        r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
        
        # Step 2: Reverse mapping from r to original characters
        mapping = {char: encoded[i] for i, char in enumerate(r)}
        
        # Step 3: Decode the string
        decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
        
        print(decoded)
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly establish the reverse mapping and decode the string. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
