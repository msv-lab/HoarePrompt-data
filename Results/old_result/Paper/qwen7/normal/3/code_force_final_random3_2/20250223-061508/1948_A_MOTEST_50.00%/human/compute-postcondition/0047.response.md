Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is 2 if `t` was 1 or 4 if `t` was 3, `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is 's[x]s[x]', `x` is 3, `j` is 0**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` in the string `s` twice to the string `ans`. Given that `x` is 3, `ans` will become `ans + s[3] + s[3]`, which means `ans` will now contain the character at index 3 in the string `s` repeated twice. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
