Output State: All elements in the array `arr` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` are set to values ranging from `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` to `big_element - 1`. The corresponding elements in the `cliquess` array are all set to the value of `clique - (not_mid - 1)` to `clique`.

In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `arr` array will have its elements from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` filled with values starting from `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` and decrementing by 1 until `big_element - 1`. Similarly, the `cliquess` array will have its elements from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` set to values starting from `clique - (not_mid - 1)` and decrementing by 1 until `clique`.
