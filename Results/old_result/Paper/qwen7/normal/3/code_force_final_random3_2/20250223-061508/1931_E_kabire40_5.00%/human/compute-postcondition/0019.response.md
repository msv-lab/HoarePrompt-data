Output State: **`operational_list` is a non-empty list containing the split elements of the input string, excluding the first two elements; `x` is the third element in the list; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`; `rev_res` is incremented by `x` if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, otherwise `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `x_rev = int(x[::-1])` reverses the string `x`, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to `x_rev`. The length comparison between `x` and `x_rev` (as strings) is not performed in this line, so the conditions for updating `rev_res` or setting `rev_val` are not evaluated yet. Therefore, the initial conditions remain valid, and only `x_rev` is updated with the reversed integer value of `x`.
