Output State: **`i` is 29, `n` is 29, `flag` is 0, `s[i]` is '1', and `s[i + 1]` is either '0' or '1' based on the value of `flag`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `flag`. The values of `i`, `n`, `s[i]`, and `s[i + 1]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
