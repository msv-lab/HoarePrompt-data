Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the given program step-by-step to ensure it correctly calculates the minimum number of tents required for each test case.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Tent Calculation Logic**:
   - The program checks if the number of extroverts `b` is such that it cannot be fully accommodated with universals without violating the condition that each extrovert needs exactly two others. Specifically, it checks if `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`. If true, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to accommodate all extroverts under these conditions.
   - If the above condition is not met, the program calculates the number of tents required:
     - `a` introverts each need their own tent, contributing `a` tents.
     - Extroverts and universals together need to be divided into groups of 3. The number of full groups of 3 is `(b + c) // 3`.
     - If there are remaining individuals (`(b + c) % 3 != 0`), they require an additional tent.

3. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the total number of tents required for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to handle all edge cases correctly, including when it's impossible to accommodate all participants due to the constraints on extroverts.

Thus, the program logic aligns with the problem statement and handles all possible scenarios appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
