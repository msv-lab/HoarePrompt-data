You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

        #This is printed: 3
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is either 2 or an integer such that 2 < n ≤ 50, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ n, `p_i` ≠ i, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list of length `n+1` where the first element is 0, and the other elements are integer inputs split from the input string. If `n` is 2, `p` is a list of 2 integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 2, `p_i` ≠ i, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list of length 3 where the first element is 0, and the other two elements are integer inputs split from the input string. If `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 50, and `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the array `p` representing the best friends.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is a mistake because the function should be called within the loop to process each test case.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes a list `v` with zeros.
   - It updates the list `v` with the values from the input array `p`.
   - For the special case where `n == 2`, it prints `2` directly, which is correct based on the problem statement.

4. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other’s best friends and also have each other’s best friends invited. If such a pair is found, it prints `2`.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n == 2` correctly.
   - However, the function `func_1()` is not being called for each test case, which means the logic inside `func_1()` is not executed for any test case.

### Corrected Version

To fix the issue, we need to call `func_1()` inside the loop that processes each test case. Here is the corrected version:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(2)
    else:
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
        print(3)
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect because it does not call the function `func_1()` for each test case. After fixing this, the program should work correctly.

**Correctness: False**

If the function `func_1()` is called for each test case, the program would be correct.
