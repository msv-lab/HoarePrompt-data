Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons. Specifically, the logic in `func_2` does not accurately account for the placement of 1x1 and 2x2 icons on the screens.

Let's analyze the logic in `func_2`:

1. **Case with both 1x1 and 2x2 icons:**
   - The calculation `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` is correct for determining how many full 2x2 icons can fit.
   - However, the subsequent logic to adjust `x` and calculate `bxsfory1` is flawed. The adjustment `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect because it assumes each 2x2 icon takes up 15 cells instead of 4, and the addition of `y * 4` is unnecessary.

2. **Case with only 2x2 icons:**
   - The logic `print(math.ceil(y / 2))` is correct for this case.

3. **Case with only 1x1 icons:**
   - The logic `print(math.ceil(x / 15))` is incorrect because it assumes each 1x1 icon takes up 15 cells instead of 1.

4. **Case with no icons:**
   - The logic `print(0)` is correct for this case.

To fix the program, we need to correctly calculate the number of screens needed for both types of icons. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    # Calculate the number of 2x2 icons that can fit
    num_2x2_screens = math.ceil(y / 2)
    # Calculate the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
    remaining_space = 5 * 3 - 4 * num_2x2_screens
    # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit in the remaining space
    num_1x1_screens = math.ceil((x + remaining_space) / 15)
    # Total number of screens needed
    total_screens = num_2x2_screens + num_1x1_screens
    print(total_screens)

def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons according to the problem description.
