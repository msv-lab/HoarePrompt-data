Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. `[*open(0)]` is a list with at least 2 elements. This means the list contains at least two items.
2. The third element of `[*open(0)]` is a string that is split by spaces. Let's denote this string as `third_element`.
3. `k` is the first integer from `third_element`.
4. `x` is the second integer from `third_element`.
5. `a` is the third integer from `third_element`.
6. `s` is the third element of `[*open(0)]`, which is the same string `third_element`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('NO')
```

Given the above breakdown, the print statement will simply output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
