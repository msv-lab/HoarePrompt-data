Output State: **`mak` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variable values. It only flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which is an operation related to I/O and not to variable assignment or modification. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
