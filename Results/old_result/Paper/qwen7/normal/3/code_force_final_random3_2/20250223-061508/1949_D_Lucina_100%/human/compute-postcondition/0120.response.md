Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `a[i]` is 0, `b[i]` is greater than 0, `sa` is a list containing the value 1, `sb` is a list containing the value 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `sb`. Since `i` was already 1, appending it to `sb` results in `sb` containing the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
