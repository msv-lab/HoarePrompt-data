Output State: **`cnt` is either 1 or 2, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 2, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. Since `cnt` was either 0 or 1 initially, it now becomes either 1 or 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
