Based on the initial state provided:

- After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `x`, where `x` is a non-negative integer.
- `z` will be the sum of `z` initialized to 0 plus the value of `z // (k - 1) + 1` added for each iteration from 0 to `x`.
- The value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
