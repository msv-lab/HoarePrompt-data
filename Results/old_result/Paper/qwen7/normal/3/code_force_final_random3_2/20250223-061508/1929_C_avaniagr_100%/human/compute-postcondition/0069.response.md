Postcondition: `[*open(0)]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `k` is an integer from the split string, `x` is an integer from the split string, `a` is an integer from the split string, and `z` is an integer that has been updated multiple times according to the rule `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` starting from its initial value. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z` after all updates, then `a` remains unchanged. If `a` is less than `z`, then `a` is updated to `z`.
