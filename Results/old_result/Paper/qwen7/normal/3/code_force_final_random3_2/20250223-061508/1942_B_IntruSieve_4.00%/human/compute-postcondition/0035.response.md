Output State: **`minn` is either `maxx` + 1 or `maxx` + 2; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer; `mex` is a list containing either the absolute difference between each element in `arr` and `minn`, followed by `minn`, or one additional element which is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`, and now `mex` has an additional element which is `minn`; `maxx` is updated to the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` if `abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`.**

In this step, the code appends `minn` to the list `mex`. This means that `mex` now includes all previously calculated absolute differences between elements in `arr` and `minn`, plus the current `minn` itself. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
