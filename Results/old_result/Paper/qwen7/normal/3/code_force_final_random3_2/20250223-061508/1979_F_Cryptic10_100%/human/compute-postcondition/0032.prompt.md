Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive), `ops` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t-2` (possibly excluding one element), `ops` is a list containing tuples where either `(v1, v2)` or `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are included, `v1` is an integer from `vx`, `v2` is an integer from `vx` and `v1 != v2`, and if the else part is executed, `v2` is less than or equal to 0 and `v3` is the first element returned by `q(0)` and is no longer in `vx`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t-2` with one or two elements removed, `ops` is a list containing tuples where either `(v1, v2)` or `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are included, `v1` and `v2` are assigned the values of `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and `len(ops)` is increased by 1 if `v2 > 0`; otherwise, `ops` now includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` added to its end.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `vx` has at least 1 element, `ops` is a list containing tuples where either `(v1, v2)` or `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are included, `v1` is equal to `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `v2` is also equal to `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and `ops` includes an additional tuple `(v1, v2)` where both `v1` and `v2` are equal to `q(len(vx) - 2)` if `v2 > 0`; otherwise, `v3` is assigned the value of `q(0)` and `v3` is added to `ops`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
