Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
   ```

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must remain greater than 0.

5. **Conditions in Loop Body:**
   - If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `c[1]` must be equal to `a[1]`.
   - If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `possible` is set to `True` if `c[1]` is neither equal to `a[1]` nor `b[1]`.

6. **State After Adjustment:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
