Output State: **`custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `best` is total + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `best` remains `sys.float_info.max`, `cases` remains unchanged, `pos_final` is an input integer decreased by 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `total` is the new cumulative cost which is the previous `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `v` is an integer within the bounds of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` and is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the `total` variable is updated to include the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. All other variables retain their previous values or conditions as described in the initial state.
