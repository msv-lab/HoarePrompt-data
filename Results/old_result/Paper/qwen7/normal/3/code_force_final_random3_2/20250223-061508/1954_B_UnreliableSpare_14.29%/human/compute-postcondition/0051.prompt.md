You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: Postcondition: `flag` remains `False`, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer greater than 4, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, and the loop has executed for all values of `i` from 1 to `n-1`. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]` for any `i`, the loop breaks out of the iteration early due to the `break` statement.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: All elements of `arr` have been iterated over, `i` is equal to `n`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr` plus one for any segment that does not start with `val`.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of val in arr plus one for any segment that does not start with val)
    #State: Postcondition: `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr` plus one for any segment that does not start with `val`, and `cnt` is updated to be the new value of `ans`. This holds whether the `flag` is true or false.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5), and a list of n integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
