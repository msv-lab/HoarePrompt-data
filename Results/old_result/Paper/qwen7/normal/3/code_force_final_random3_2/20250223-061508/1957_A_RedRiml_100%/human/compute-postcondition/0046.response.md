Output State: **`shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`, and `pl` is a list of unique elements.**

Explanation: The code `shapes += d[j] // 3` updates the value of `shapes` by adding `d[j] // 3` to its current value. The initial state of `shapes` is increased by `d[pl[k+1]] // 3` if `d[pl[k+1]] >= 3`, otherwise `shapes` remains unchanged. However, since the code does not reference `k` or `pl`, it only modifies `shapes` based on `j`. The list `pl` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
