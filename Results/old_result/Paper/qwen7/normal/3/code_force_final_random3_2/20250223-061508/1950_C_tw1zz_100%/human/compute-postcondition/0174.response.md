Postcondition: `h1` is a string representing the hour in 12-hour format, `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'. If `h` is '09', then `h1` is '09', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '10', then `h1` is '10', `time` is 'AM', and `h` remains '10'. If `h` is '11', then `h1` is '11', `time` is 'AM', and `h` remains '11'. If `h` is '12', then `h1` is '12', `time` is 'PM', and `h` remains '12'. If `h` is '13', then `h1` is '01', `time` is 'PM', and `h` becomes '13'. Otherwise, `h1` can be '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '10', '11', '12', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM', and `h` is neither '13' nor '23'.
