Output: **n // 2 * b + a (where n is the first integer input, a is the second integer input, and b is the third integer input)**

Explanation:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable `t` is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
- `n` is the first integer input provided by the user.
- `a` is the second integer input provided by the user.
- `b` is the third integer input provided by the user.
- The expression `n // 2 * b + a` calculates the integer division of `n` by 2, multiplies the result by `b`, and then adds `a`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the result of the expression `n // 2 * b + a`, where `n`, `a`, and `b` are the values provided as inputs by the user.
