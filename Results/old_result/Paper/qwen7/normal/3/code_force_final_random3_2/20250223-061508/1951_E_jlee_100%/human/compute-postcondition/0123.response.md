Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True, and `count` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `j`, `n`, `done`, and `count`. It only causes the exit from the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values, and the only additional information is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
