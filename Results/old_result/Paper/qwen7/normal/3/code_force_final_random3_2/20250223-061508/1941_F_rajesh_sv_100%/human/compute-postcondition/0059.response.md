Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `l` is `mid + 1`, and `h` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to be `mid + 1`. The values of `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `mid`, and `h` remain unchanged from their initial states.
