Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n` is assigned the first integer from the input, `a` is assigned the second integer from the input, `b` is assigned the third integer from the input. Since both the if and else parts do not change the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
