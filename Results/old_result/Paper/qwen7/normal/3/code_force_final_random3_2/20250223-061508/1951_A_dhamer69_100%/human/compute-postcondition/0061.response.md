Postcondition: `start` is greater than 1, `end` is an integer, `t` is `start - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string. If `s` equals '00', the condition remains unchanged. If `s.count('11') == 1 and s.count('1') == 2`, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.
