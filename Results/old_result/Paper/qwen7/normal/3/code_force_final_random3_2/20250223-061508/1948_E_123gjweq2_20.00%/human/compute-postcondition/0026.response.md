The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. Both `left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n`, and `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier. The function does not explicitly return any value in the given information, but it likely creates or modifies an array based on the provided parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `left`, `right`, and `clique`, where `left` and `right` are integers satisfying `0 <= left < right < n`, and `clique` is an integer representing a clique identifier. The function creates or modifies an array based on these parameters.**
