Output State: **`i` is 2, `N` must be at least 2, `s` is 1, `arr` contains the tuples `(2, 1, num)`, `(2, 1, num)`, and `(2, 1, num)` where `num` is equal to `nums[2]`**.

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to the list `arr`. Given the initial state where `s` is 1 and `i` is 2, the new tuple becomes `(2, 2, num)`. Since `arr` initially contained the tuples `(1, 0, num)` and `(2, 1, num)`, after appending `(2, 2, num)`, `arr` now contains three tuples: `(1, 0, num)`, `(2, 1, num)`, and `(2, 2, num)`. The values of `i`, `N`, and `s` remain unchanged.
