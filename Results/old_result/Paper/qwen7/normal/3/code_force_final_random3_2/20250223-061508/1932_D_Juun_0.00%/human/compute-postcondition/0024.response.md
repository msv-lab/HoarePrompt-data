Output State: **`trumps` is the same as before, `answers` is the same as before plus one new element which is ' '.join([('hearts', rank), ('diamonds', rank)]), `rank` is the first element of `card`, `suit` is the second element of `card`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the `answers` list. This new element is created by joining a space-separated string of tuples, where each tuple consists of a suit from `suits[suit]` (which are 'hearts' and 'diamonds') and the `rank`. The list `[suits[suit], rank]` is sorted, and then each element is paired with its corresponding suit. The sorted order ensures that the ranks are considered in their natural order, and the suits are paired accordingly. The `rank` and `suit` variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the code snippet.
