Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string from the user.**

The code `s = input()` assigns the input value from the user to the variable `s`. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
