Output State: **`ops` is an empty list, `p1` contains the elements of `vx` in their original order, `p2` is an empty list, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive), and `ops` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code first creates a set `vx` containing integers from 1 up to the input integer (inclusive) using a generator expression within the `set` function. It also initializes an empty list `ops`. The initial state of `p1` and `p2` remains unchanged.
