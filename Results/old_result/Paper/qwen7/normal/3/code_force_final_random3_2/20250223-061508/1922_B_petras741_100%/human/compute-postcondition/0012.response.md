Output State: **`q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1, `j` is `j + 1`, and `j + 1` is less than `n`**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q[w[j]]` by 1. It also updates `j` to `j + 1`. Since `j + 1` was already less than `n` before the increment, it remains less than `n` after the increment. Therefore, the updated states of the variables are as described.
