Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This means `t` can take any integer value within this range, but it does not affect the print statement directly.
- `i` is 2. This is irrelevant to the print statement since `i` is not used in the expression being printed.
- `x` is an input integer. Since `x` is an input integer, its value is unknown until provided, but it will be used to calculate `y`.
- `y` is `x // 2`. The double slash `//` denotes integer division, which means `y` will be the integer part of `x` divided by 2.

The print statement is `print(y)`, which will print the value of `y`.

Output: **[x // 2]** (where `[x // 2]` represents the integer division of the input integer `x` by 2)
