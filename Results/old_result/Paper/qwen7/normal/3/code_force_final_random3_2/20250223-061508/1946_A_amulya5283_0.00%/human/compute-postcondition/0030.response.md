Output State: **`operations` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a slice of `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, `heap` is a heap data structure.**

Explanation: The `heapq.heapify(heap)` function transforms the list `heap` into a heap, which is a type of binary tree where the parent node is less than or equal to its child nodes. However, since the exact elements of `heap` are not specified, we only know that it is now a heap. All other variables remain unchanged.
