Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and either `x // i` or `i`, `i` is a divisor of `x` and \(x \% i == 0\), and the condition `n <= x // i` is true.
