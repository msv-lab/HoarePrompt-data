Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x // 2`, and `x` is reassigned to an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `x = int(input())` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `x`. The previous value of `x` (which was `x // 2`) is replaced by the new input value. The values of `t`, `i`, and `y` remain unchanged.
