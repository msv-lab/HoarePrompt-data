Postcondition: `dp[i][j]` is calculated as follows: if the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is 1, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is calculated as the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`, with the condition that `j` is `n-2`.
