Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the range for the variable `j`. Therefore, the only variables involved in the loop head are `j`, `4`, and `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `j` is within the range defined by `range(4, n + 1)`. This means `j` must be between 4 and `n` (inclusive).

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 1
   - `n` must be greater than 4
   - `i` must be 1

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is not involved in the loop head, its state remains unchanged.
   - The loop will increment `j` starting from 4 up to `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be 4 or greater and less than or equal to `n`.
   - Given that `n` must be greater than 4, the smallest possible value for `j` is 4.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - `t` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `j` starts from 4 for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 4, `j` is 4**
