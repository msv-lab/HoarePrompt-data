Output State: **`k` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, if `s[k]` is 'L', then `l` is 1, otherwise `ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD` and `r` is `r - 1`**.

Explanation: The variable `c` is incremented by 1. Initially, `k` was 0, so now `k` is 1. All other conditions and relationships remain the same as per the initial state.
