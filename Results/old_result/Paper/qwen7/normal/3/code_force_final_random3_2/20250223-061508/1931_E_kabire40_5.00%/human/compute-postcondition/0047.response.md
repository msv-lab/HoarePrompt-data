Postcondition: `x` is 2, `rev_res` is updated as the previous value of `rev_res` plus either the string representation of the integer value of the reversed string of `rev_val[1]` (if `x` is even) or the integer value of the reverse of `rev_val[1]` (if `x` is not even). `rev_val` contains at least one element.
