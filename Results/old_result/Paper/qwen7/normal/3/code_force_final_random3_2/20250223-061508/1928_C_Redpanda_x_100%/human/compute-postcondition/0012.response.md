Output State: **`prime_to_i` is now `prime_to_i * prime`; `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded.**

Explanation: The code `prime_to_i *= prime` multiplies the current value of `prime_to_i` by `prime`, updating the value of `prime_to_i`. The value of `factor * prime_to_i` is still yielded as it was before the operation, since no changes were made to `factor` or the multiplication operation itself.
