Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `k` is decreased by `nums[i]` which is equal to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `n` must be greater than 0 and `nums[i]` is equal to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. The code `k -= nums[i]` subtracts the value of `nums[i]` from `k`. Since `nums[i]` is specifically defined as `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, `k` is decreased by this value. The conditions on `n` remain unchanged.
