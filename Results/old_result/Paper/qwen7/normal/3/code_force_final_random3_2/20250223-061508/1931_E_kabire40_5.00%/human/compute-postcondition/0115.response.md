Output State: **`operational_list` must contain at least one element; `rev_res` is `rev_res` plus `x`; `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of `x`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res = rev_res + x` updates the value of `rev_res` by adding the value of `x` to it. The other variables (`operational_list` and `x_rev`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
