Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `k` is `k - Max`, `Min` is `min(n // (k - Max), k - Max)`, `Max` is `k - Max`, `number` is `Min`, `tab` is an empty list, `t` is 61.**

Explanation: The code `k = k - Max` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `Max` from its current value. Since `Max` is initially equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, the updated value of `k` is `k - Max`. All other variables remain unchanged.
