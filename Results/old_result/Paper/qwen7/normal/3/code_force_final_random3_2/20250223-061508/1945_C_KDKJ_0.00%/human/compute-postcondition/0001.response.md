Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', and the input provided by `int(input())` must be a positive integer, and `func_1()` has been called.**

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called, but since no specific implementation of `func_1()` is provided, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables. However, we know that `func_1()` has been executed, and the precondition remains unchanged except for the fact that `func_1()` has been called.
