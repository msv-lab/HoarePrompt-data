### Reasoning

The original program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program reads all inputs for multiple test cases in a single loop, which is incorrect. It should process each test case separately.

2. **Checking if the Robot Can Reach the Last Column:**
   - The condition `if b[-2] != '>'` is too restrictive. It only checks the second-to-last column, which might not be sufficient to ensure the robot can reach the last column. The robot needs to be able to move to the last column from the second-to-last column, and the last column itself must have an arrow pointing to the right.

3. **Final Check for Reaching the Target Cell:**
   - The program only checks if the robot can move to the last column of the second row but does not ensure that the robot can actually move from the last column of the second row to the target cell `(2, n)`. The final check should ensure that the robot can move from the last column of the second row to the target cell.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Check if the robot can move to the last column of the second row
        if b[-1] == '<':
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if the robot can move from the last column of the second row to the target cell
        if b[-1] == '>':
            if a[-1] == '>':
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program now reads each test case separately using a loop that iterates `t` times.

2. **Checking if the Robot Can Reach the Last Column:**
   - The condition `if b[-1] == '<'` ensures that the robot cannot stay in the last column of the second row without moving to the last column. If the last column of the second row has an arrow pointing left, the robot cannot reach the last column, so we print 'NO'.

3. **Final Check for Reaching the Target Cell:**
   - If the last column of the second row has an arrow pointing right, the program checks if the last column of the first row also has an arrow pointing right. If both arrows point right, the robot can move from the last column of the second row to the target cell, so we print 'YES'. Otherwise, we print 'NO'.

### Final Evaluation

Given the corrected program, the original program is incorrect. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
