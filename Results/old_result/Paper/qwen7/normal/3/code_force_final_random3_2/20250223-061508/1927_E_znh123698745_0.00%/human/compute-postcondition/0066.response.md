Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `a` is `[1, -1]`, `answer` is `[1]`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to n inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `a = [1, -1]` changes the list `a` to `[1, -1]`. All other variables (`i`, `answer`, `n`, `k`, and `array`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
