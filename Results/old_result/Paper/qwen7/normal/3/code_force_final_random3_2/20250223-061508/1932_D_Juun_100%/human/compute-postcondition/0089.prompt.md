You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", and the description of 2n cards consists of 2n two-character strings where the first character is the rank of the card ("23456789") and the second character is the suit of the card ("CDHS"). All cards are unique within each test case.
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: All cards have been processed, `trumps` is a list containing all ranks of cards that match the trump suit, `answers` is a list containing all valid answers generated during the loop execution, and `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values are all `None`.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: Output State: `trumps` is an empty list since it has been emptied after all its elements were popped in each iteration, `answers` is a list containing all valid answers generated during the loop execution with each element being a string formatted as f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}', `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are `None` since all ranks have been processed and there are no more valid answers to generate.
    #
    #In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, processing all ranks for each suit and generating the required answers. The `trumps` list is now empty because all its elements have been popped out. The `suits` dictionary reflects that all ranks have been processed, with all values set to `None`.
    trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: Output State: `trumps` is an empty list.
    #
    #Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `trumps` will be an empty list because the loop continues to run as long as `trumps` is not empty. Since the loop removes two elements from `trumps` in each iteration (with `trumps.pop()` called twice), eventually `trumps` will become empty, causing the loop to terminate. At this point, there are no more elements left to pop from `trumps`, so it remains empty.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: `answers` is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes a set of card descriptions and does not return anything since there is no return statement in the provided code. If the function reaches a point where it needs to return, it returns None.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None

Case_2: The program does not return anything since there is no return statement in the provided code.

Case_3: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
