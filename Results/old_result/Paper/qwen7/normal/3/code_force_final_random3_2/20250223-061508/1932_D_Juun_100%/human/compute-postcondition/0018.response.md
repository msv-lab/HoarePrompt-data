Output State: **`suits[suit]` is now equal to `rank`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump suit` is a string, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values are 'None' except for the key `suit` which is now mapped to `rank`.**

This means that the dictionary `suits` now has its entry for the key `suit` updated to the value of `rank`, while the other entries remain `None`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
