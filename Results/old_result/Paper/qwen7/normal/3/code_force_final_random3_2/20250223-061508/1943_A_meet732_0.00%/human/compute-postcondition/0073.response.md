Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be at least 1, `cntl[2]` is less than 2, `c` is False or `j` (which is 2) equals `n` - 1.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is decremented by 1. Given the initial condition that `c` is either False or `j` (which is 2) equals `n`, after decrementing `c` by 1, `c` becomes `False` or `j` (which is 2) equals `n` - 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
