Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer representing the size of the array), x and y (two integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers), and arr (a list of n integers representing the elements of the array); `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    freq = {}
    count = 0
    for a in arr:
        rx = (-a % x + x) % x
        ry = a % y
        if (rx, ry) in freq:
            count += freq[rx, ry]
        current_pair = a % x, a % y
        if current_pair in freq:
            freq[current_pair] += 1
        else:
            freq[current_pair] = 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `count` is the sum of all increments made during the loop, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each unique pair `(a % x, a % y)` encountered in `arr`, and `current_pair` is the last pair considered in the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All elements in `arr` have been processed; `count` is the sum of `freq[rx, ry]` for each unique pair `(rx, ry)` where `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` and `ry = a % y`, plus 1 for each occurrence of the pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`; `rx` and `ry` are calculated for the last element `a` in `arr`; `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y); `freq` is updated to reflect the frequency of each unique pair `(rx, ry)` and `(a % x, a % y)` encountered during the loop execution; `results` is appended with the value of `count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `arr` will be an empty list, `rx` will be the last calculated value of (-a % x + x) % x, `ry` will be the last calculated value of a % y, `count` will be the sum of `freq[rx, ry]` for all pairs where `rx` and `ry` match any previously seen pairs, `current_pair` will be the last calculated pair of (a % x, a % y), and `results` will contain the final value of `count`. The dictionary `freq` will store the frequency of each unique `(a % x, a % y)` pair seen throughout the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
