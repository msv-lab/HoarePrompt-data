Output State: **`left` is 1, `right` must be at least 3, and `new_arr` is a list containing `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `new_arr.append(arr[left])` appends the element at index `left` (which is 2) of the list `arr` to the list `new_arr`. Since `left` was initially 2, `new_arr` now contains `arr[0]` and `arr[1]` (as it already had `arr[0]` and at least one of `arr[1]` or `arr[right]`). The value of `left` is updated to 1 because `arr[left]` was appended to `new_arr`, and the condition that `right` must be at least 3 remains unchanged.
