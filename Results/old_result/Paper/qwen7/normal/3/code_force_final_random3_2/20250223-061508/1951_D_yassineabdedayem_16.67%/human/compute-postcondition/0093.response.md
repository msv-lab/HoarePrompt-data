Output State: **`rep` is 2, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Min`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of either `Min` or `Max` and now includes the string representation of `Min`, `k` is `k - Max`**.

Explanation: The code `k = k - Max` subtracts the value of `Max` from `k`. Since `Max` is defined as `max(int(n / k), k)`, the value of `k` is updated accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged.
