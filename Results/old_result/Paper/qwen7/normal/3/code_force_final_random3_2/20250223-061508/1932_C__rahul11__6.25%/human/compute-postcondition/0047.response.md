Output State: **`k` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is 2, `r` is `r - 1 - 1`, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r-1] % MOD, `c` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was `r - 1`, so after decrementing, `r` becomes `r - 1 - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
