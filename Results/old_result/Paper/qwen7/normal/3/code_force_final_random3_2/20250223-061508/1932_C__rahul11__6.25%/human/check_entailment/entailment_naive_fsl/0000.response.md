Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the product of the array elements exceeds the modulus `m`. Specifically, the program calculates the product of the array elements and then takes the modulus `m` twice, which is unnecessary and incorrect. The correct approach is to take the modulus `m` after each multiplication to prevent overflow.

Here is a counterexample that demonstrates the issue:

Consider the input:
```
1
4 100
10 20 30 40
LRRL
```

The correct output should be:
```
0 0 0 0
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0 20 60 40
```

This is because the product of the array elements (10 * 20 * 30 * 40 = 24000) exceeds the modulus (100), and the program does not correctly handle this overflow.

To fix this, the program should update the product modulo `m` after each multiplication:
```python
def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans = (ans * i) % m
        res[0] = ans % m % MOD
        c = 1
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = (ans // arr[l]) % m
                res[c] = ans % m % MOD
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = (ans // arr[r]) % m
                res[c] = ans % m % MOD
                r -= 1
            c += 1
        print(*res)
```

After fixing this, the program should work correctly for all cases.
