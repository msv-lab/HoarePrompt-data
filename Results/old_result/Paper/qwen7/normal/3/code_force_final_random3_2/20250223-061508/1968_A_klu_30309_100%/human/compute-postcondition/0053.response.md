Output State: **`max_sum` remains 0, `x` must be greater than 2, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `y`, `gcd_val` is recalculated as the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y**.

In this case, the code simply updates the value of `current_sum` to be the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`. Since `y` is already defined as `x - 2` and `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is now `gcd_val + (x - 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
