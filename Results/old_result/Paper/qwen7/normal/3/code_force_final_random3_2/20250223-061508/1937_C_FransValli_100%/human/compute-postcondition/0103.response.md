Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `range(1, n)`. This means the loop will start from `1` and go up to `n-1`.

3. **Initial Values**:
   - `arr` is `[0]`.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `res` is the last input string received.
   - `maxi` is the maximum value between 0 and any value assigned to it during the loop (which happens when `res` equals '<').

4. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to `n`, and the loop starts from `1` and goes up to `n-1`, `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute at least once.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be less than `n`.

5. **Final State**:
   - `arr` remains `[0]`.
   - `n` remains greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute.
   - `res` and `maxi` remain as they are because they are not part of the loop head.

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` must be less than `n`**
