Output State: **`dp[i][j]` is calculated as max(`dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`), with the condition that `j` is `n-2`.**

Explanation: The given code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the maximum of three possible values: `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. This calculation is performed under the condition that `j` is `n-2`. The initial state of `dp[i][j]` being calculated as described is updated to reflect this new rule, but no specific values are provided for `dp[i][j]` because the exact values depend on the values of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1]`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. The precondition that `j` is `n-2` remains unchanged and is included in the output state.
