Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates through each test case, reading three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case.
3. The conditions for determining whether the digits form a stair or a peak are correctly implemented:
   - For a stair: `a < b < c`
   - For a peak: `a < b > c`
4. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".
5. The program handles multiple test cases as specified, and the logic for each test case is correctly applied.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the implementation appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
