Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `N`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop condition is `i < N + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `N` must be at least 0.

3. **Determine the new value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `N + 1`. Therefore, `i` will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the state of `N`**:
   - The value of `N` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop condition does not change the value of `N`.

5. **Summarize the updated states**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `N` must still be at least 0.
   - The values of `s` and `arr` are not affected by the loop head and thus remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is 2, `N` must be at least 0, `s` is 1, and `arr` contains the tuples `(1, 0, num)` and `(2, 1, num); num` is equal to `nums[i]`.**
