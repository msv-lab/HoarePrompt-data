Output State: **t must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations the loop has executed.**

In natural language: The value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases, must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations the loop has executed. Since the loop runs `t` times, `t` must be at least as large as this total number of iterations.
