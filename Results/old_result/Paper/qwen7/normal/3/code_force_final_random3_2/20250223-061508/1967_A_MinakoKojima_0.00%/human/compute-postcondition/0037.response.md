Output State: **`ans` is 0, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, or `m`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
