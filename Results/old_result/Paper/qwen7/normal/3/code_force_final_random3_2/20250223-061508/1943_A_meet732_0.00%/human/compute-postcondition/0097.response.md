Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` must have at least one element.
   - `i` is the second element of `a`.
   - `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.
   - `cntl[i]` is now `cntl[i] + 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the second element of `a`, for the loop to continue, `a` must still have at least two elements (because `i` is the second element).
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was the second element of `a`, so for the next iteration, `i` will be the third element of `a` (since we are iterating through each element of `a`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `a` must have at least two elements.
- `i` will be the third element of `a`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` must have at least two elements, `i` is the third element of `a`**
