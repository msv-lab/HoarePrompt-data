Output State: **`h1` is '07', `m1` is equal to `m`, `h` and `m` are updated to the input values split by ':', `time` is 'PM'**.

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. The values of `h1`, `m1`, `h`, `m`, and the original state of `time` being an empty string are not changed by this assignment. Therefore, the output state retains the unchanged values of `h1`, `m1`, `h`, `m`, and updates `time` to `'PM'`.
