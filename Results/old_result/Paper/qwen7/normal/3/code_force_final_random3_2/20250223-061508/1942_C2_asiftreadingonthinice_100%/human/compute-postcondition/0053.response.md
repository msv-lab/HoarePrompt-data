Output State: **`tmp` is a non-empty list, and the value of `y` is less than `i - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify the values of `tmp` or `y`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no such context is provided, we assume it breaks out of an implied loop or conditional. The values of `tmp` and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state.
