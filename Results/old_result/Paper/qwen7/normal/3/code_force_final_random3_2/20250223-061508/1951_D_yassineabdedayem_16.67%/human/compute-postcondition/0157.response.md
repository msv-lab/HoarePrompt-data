Output State: **`n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is decreased by `Min`, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The code `n -= Min * Max` subtracts the product of `Min` and `Max` from `n`. The values of `k`, `number`, `Min`, `Max`, and `tab` remain unchanged except for `n`, which is updated according to the given operation.
