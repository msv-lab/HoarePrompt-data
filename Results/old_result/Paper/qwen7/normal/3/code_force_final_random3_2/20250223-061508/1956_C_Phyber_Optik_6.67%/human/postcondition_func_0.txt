The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases) and an integer `n` (an integer within the range 1 to 500). For each test case, it calculates a sum based on specific conditions and prints the sum along with another integer `r`. It then prints sequences of numbers based on the value of `j` ranging from 1 to `n + r + 1`. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the final state where `t` is set to 0, indicating all test cases have been processed.
