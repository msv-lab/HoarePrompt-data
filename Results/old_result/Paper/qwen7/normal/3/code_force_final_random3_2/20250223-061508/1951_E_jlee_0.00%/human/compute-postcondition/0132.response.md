Postcondition: `done` is True, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string, `n` is 1, `x` is the first character of the input string, `count` is 1, `count2` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, and the first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of `s. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then `count` is set to 1.
