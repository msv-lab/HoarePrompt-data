Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()` Analysis**:
   - The function takes no arguments but reads input data for each test case.
   - It initializes a list `v` of size `n+1` with zeros and updates it with the input values.
   - For \( n = 2 \), it directly prints `2`, which is the correct answer because both friends must be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - For \( n > 2 \), it iterates through each friend and checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., `v[v[v[i]]] == i`). If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns, indicating that only two invitations are needed.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`, indicating that three invitations are needed.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the edge case when \( n = 2 \).
   - For \( n > 2 \), the logic ensures that if any pair of friends are each other's best friends, only two invitations are needed. Otherwise, three invitations are required.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic in the function is sound and correctly implements the problem requirements.
   - The function correctly identifies whether two or three invitations are needed based on the input.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the input for each test case and processes it according to the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided function `func_1()` correctly implements the solution for the problem statement. Therefore, the annotated program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
