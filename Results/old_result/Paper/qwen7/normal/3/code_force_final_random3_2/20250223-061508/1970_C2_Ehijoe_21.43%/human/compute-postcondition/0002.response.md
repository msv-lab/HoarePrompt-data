Output State: **`empty` is True, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, and `moves` is a list of integers representing the sequence of moves made during the game.**

The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `empty`. No other changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `t`, `edges`, `start`, and `moves` remain unchanged from their initial states.
