Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i`, `n`.
2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (the starting point of the `range(n)` function).
   - `n` is a variable that defines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Check the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
- `nums` is a list of `n` zeros.

We only need to adjust the state of `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
