Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `w` is a list of integers from the input.
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `eta` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n`, inclusive, and for each `j` from 0 to `n`, `q[j] > 0`.
   - `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`.
   - If `eta_ln` equals 1, then `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`.
   - Otherwise, `j` will be equal to `eta_ln`, `res` will be the sum of all the increments calculated in each iteration of the loop, and `rho` will be the cumulative sum of all `q[eta[j]]` values for each `j` from 0 to `eta_ln-1`.
   - If `n` is less than 3, `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `buffer` remains a list containing integers from the input, `i` remains 0, `n` remains an input integer less than 3, and `w` remains a list of integers from the input.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `buffer` remains a list containing integers from the input.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `w` remains a list of integers from the input.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers from the input.**
