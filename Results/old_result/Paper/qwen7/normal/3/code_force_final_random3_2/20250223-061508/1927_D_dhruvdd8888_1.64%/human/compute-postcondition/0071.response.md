Based on the initial state provided:

- `eli` is the result of `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`, which means `eli` is the position in `arr` where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to keep the list sorted.
- `N` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `N + 1`.
- `s` is `N`.
- `num` is `nums[N]`.
- `arr` contains tuples starting from `(2, 0, nums[0])`, followed by `(1, 1, nums[0])`, and ending with a tuple `(1 + s, N, nums[N])`.
- `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one.
- `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting it to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
- `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.
- `tc` is greater than 5.

The `print(-1, -1)` statement will print the literal values `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
