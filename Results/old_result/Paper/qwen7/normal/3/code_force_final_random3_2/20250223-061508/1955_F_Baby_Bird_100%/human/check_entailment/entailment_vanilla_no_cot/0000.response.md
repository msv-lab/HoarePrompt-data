Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The formula used in the program does not accurately reflect the strategy needed to maximize Bob's wins. Specifically, the program attempts to calculate something related to the sum of the numbers but does not correctly simulate the process of removing numbers to maximize Bob's wins based on the XOR condition. The correct approach involves understanding how the XOR operation works with the counts of each type of number and strategically removing numbers to ensure the final XOR is zero.
