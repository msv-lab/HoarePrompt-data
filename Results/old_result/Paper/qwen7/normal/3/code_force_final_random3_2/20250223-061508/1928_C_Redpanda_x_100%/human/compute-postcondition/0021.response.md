Output State: **`prime_to_i` is 1, `rest` is a non-empty list, `factor` is now the first element in `rest`, and a value equal to `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**

Explanation: The code `yield factor * prime_to_i` yields the value of `factor * prime_to_i`. Since `prime_to_i` is 1 and `factor` is the first element in `rest`, the yielded value is simply `factor`. The values of `prime_to_i` and `rest` remain unchanged, but `factor` is now referred to as the first element in `rest`.
