Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in tmp:`. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over the list `tmp`, the initial value of `i` should be the first element of `tmp`.

3. **Consider the State of Other Variables**: The other variables (`tmp`, `y`, `ans`, `ii`, `a`, `n`, `x`, and `len(a)`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their states do not affect whether the loop can execute.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `i` is set to the first element of `tmp` for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is the first element of `tmp`**.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is the first element of `tmp`**.
