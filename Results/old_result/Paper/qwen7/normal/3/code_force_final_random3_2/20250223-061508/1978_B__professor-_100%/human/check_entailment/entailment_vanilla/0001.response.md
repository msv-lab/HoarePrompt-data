### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize Bob's profit by choosing an optimal \( k \).
   - If \( b \leq a \), Bob should sell all buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - If \( b - a < n \), Bob should sell the first \( b - a + 1 \) buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price.
   - If \( b - a \geq n \), Bob should sell the first \( n \) buns at the modified prices.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly handles the first condition where \( b \leq a \) by printing \( n \times a \).
   - For the case where \( b - a < n \), the code calculates the sum of the first \( b - a + 1 \) terms of an arithmetic sequence and adds the usual price for the remaining buns. This is done using the formula for the sum of the first \( m \) natural numbers: \( \frac{m(m+1)}{2} \).
   - For the case where \( b - a \geq n \), the code also uses the same arithmetic sequence sum formula to calculate the profit from the first \( n \) buns and adds the usual price for the remaining buns.

3. **Verification:**
   - The logic in the code matches the problem statement for all given conditions.
   - The formulas used are correct for calculating the sum of the modified prices and the usual prices.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given conditions.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **True**
