Output State: **`eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `j` is equal to `n + 1`, `eta` contains all indices `i` from `0` to `n` (inclusive) where `q[i]` was greater than `0` during the loop's execution, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `0`.**

Explanation: The line `eta_ln = len(eta)` calculates the length of the list `eta` and assigns it to the variable `eta_ln`. The values of `j`, `eta`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
