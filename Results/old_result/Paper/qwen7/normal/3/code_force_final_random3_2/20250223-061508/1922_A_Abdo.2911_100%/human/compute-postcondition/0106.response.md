Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is equal to `n`. The value of `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `possible` remains True, indicating that at some point during the loop's execution, either `c[i]` was found to be equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, or `a[i]` was not equal to `b[i]` but `c[i]` was different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The strings `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings stripped of whitespace, and the element values from index `i` onwards remain unchanged. The variable `t` must also be greater than 0.
