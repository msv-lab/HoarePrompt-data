Postcondition: `test_cases` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Alice', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, the first element of `clues` is not 1, the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the third element of `clues` is greater than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`. Depending on whether the condition `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[5] - clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` holds true, `answers` will contain 'Draw' or 'Alice'.
