Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4 is still valid. The value of `n` is now an integer read from the input, which is also within the specified range.
