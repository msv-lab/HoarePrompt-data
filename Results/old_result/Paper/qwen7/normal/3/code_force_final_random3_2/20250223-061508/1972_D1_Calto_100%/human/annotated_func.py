    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: Output State: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`.
    #
    #Explanation: The given loop implements the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. After the loop completes all its iterations, the variables `a` and `b` will hold the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b` after executing the Euclidean algorithm.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`. It calculates and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. After the algorithm completes, the function state reflects that `a` contains the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
        
    #State: Output State: `cnt` is 10, `i` is 5, `m` is at least 4, `x` is `n - 24`, `y` is 25.
    #
    #To calculate this, we observe the pattern from the given information. The value of `cnt` increases by 3 each time the loop runs (from 1 to 4 to 7). This suggests that `cnt` increases by 3 with each iteration. Given that `i` increments by 1 each time, it will reach 5 after 4 iterations. The value of `x` decreases as `i` increases, following the formula `x = n - (i * i - i)`. For `i` being 5, `x` becomes `n - 24`. Similarly, `y` is calculated as `i * i`, which for `i` being 5 is 25. Therefore, after all iterations, `cnt` will be 10, `i` will be 5, and the conditions for `m` and the formulas for `x` and `y` will hold true.
    return cnt
    #The program returns cnt that is 10
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, n and m, and returns a value cnt that is always 10, regardless of the values of n and m within the specified range.
