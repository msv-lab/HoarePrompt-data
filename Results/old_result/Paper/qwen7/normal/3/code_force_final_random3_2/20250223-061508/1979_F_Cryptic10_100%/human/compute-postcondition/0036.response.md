Output State: **`ops` contains valid tuples, the length of `ops` matches the number of iterations, the last tuple's first element is `v1`, the last tuple's second element is `v2`, and the list within the last tuple is appended with `v1`.**

Explanation: The code checks if the last tuple in `ops` ends with `v2`. If true, it uses `p2`; otherwise, it uses `p1`. In both cases, it appends `v1` to the selected tuple (which is the last tuple in `ops`). Therefore, the last tuple's first element becomes `v1`, and the list within the last tuple is updated to include `v1`.
