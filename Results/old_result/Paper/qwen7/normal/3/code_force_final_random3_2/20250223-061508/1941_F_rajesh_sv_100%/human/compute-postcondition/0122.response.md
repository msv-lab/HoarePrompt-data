Output State: **`mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `l < h` must still hold true.**

Explanation: The code updates `mid` to `l + (h - l) // 2`, which is the midpoint between `l` and `h`. Then, it calculates `mid_sum` as `D[mid] + f` and `mid_next_sum` as `D[mid + 1] + f`. The condition `l < h` is maintained as per the initial state.
