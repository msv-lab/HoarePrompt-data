Postcondition: `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user; `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Bob' based on the following conditions: if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then `answers` is determined by the condition `clues[3] - 1 >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[5] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`. Otherwise, `answers` is determined by the condition `clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`.
