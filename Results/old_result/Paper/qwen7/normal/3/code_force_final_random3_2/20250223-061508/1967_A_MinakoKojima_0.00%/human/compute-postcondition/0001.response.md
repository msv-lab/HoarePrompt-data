Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input**.

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged and still satisfies the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
