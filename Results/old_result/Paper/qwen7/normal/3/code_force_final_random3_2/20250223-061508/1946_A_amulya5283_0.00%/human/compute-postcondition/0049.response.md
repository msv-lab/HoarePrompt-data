The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `arr` was already sorted, so sorting it again does not change its order. However, since `arr` was initially sorted, it remains sorted after the operation. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`operations` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a slice of `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, `heap[0]` is the original smallest element plus 3, `smallest` is the original smallest element plus 2, `heap` has been updated to include `smallest + 1` three times, `results` is [3, `n`, `arr[0]`].**
