Output State: **`rep` is 1, `n` is a non-zero integer - `Min * Max`, `k` is `k - Max`, `Min` is `n // (k + Max)`, `Max` is `int(n / (k + Max))`, `number` is `Min`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `int(n / (k + Max))`**.

Explanation: 
- The initial value of `k` is subtracted by `Max`. Since `Max` is `int(n / k)`, the new value of `k` becomes `k - Max`.
- The values of `n`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`, and `tab` are dependent on the updated value of `k`. Specifically, `Min` is now `n // (k + Max)` and `Max` is `int(n / (k + Max))`. The `number` remains `Min`, and `tab` contains the string representation of `int(n / (k + Max))`.
