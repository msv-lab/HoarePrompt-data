Given the initial state where `mex` is described as a non-empty list, and the code snippet:

```python
print(itm, end=' ')
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `itm` variable is not defined in the provided initial state, and it is not clear from the context what `itm` should refer to.
2. Since `itm` is not defined, and there is no other information about it, we cannot determine its value.
3. The `end=' '` in the `print` function specifies that the items printed should be separated by a space and there should be no newline at the end.

Given these points, since `itm` is undefined and we cannot determine its value, the output cannot be precisely determined. Therefore, we need to indicate that the value of `itm` is unknown.

Output: **itm (where itm is an undefined variable)**
