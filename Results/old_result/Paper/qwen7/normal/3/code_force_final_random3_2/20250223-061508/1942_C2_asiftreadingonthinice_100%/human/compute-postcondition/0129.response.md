Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` from the list `tmp`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + i` and `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`.
   - Otherwise, `i` is set to the next element in `tmp` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - Since the loop exits if `y < i - 1`, the value of `i` will change to the next element in `tmp`.
   - The values of `ans` and `y` will only be updated if the condition `y >= i - 1` is met, but since we are looking at the state before the exit, these values will remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Given this information, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to the next element in `tmp`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is the next element in `tmp`**
