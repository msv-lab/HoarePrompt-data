Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `cntl[j]` is less than or equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `j`, `n`, and `cntl[j]`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Given the conditions, these variables retain their original states, and the only change is that the execution breaks out of the loop or conditional block.
