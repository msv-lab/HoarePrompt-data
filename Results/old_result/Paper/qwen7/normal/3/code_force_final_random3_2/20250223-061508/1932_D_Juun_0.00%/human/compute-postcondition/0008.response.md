Output State: **`rank` and `suit` are extracted from `card`, where `card` was a single tuple containing two elements representing a card's rank and suit. The current value of `suit` is equal to `trump`; `trumps` now contains the `rank`.**

Explanation: The code appends the `rank` to the list `trumps`. The values of `rank`, `suit`, and `trump` remain unchanged, but `trumps` now includes the `rank`.
