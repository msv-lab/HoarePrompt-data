Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is incremented from 1 to `n + r`, so the final value of `j` is `n + r`.
- The condition `j > n` holds true at the end of the loop, meaning `r` remains non-negative but does not change further.

We need to evaluate the expression `j % n` and the value of `j` itself.

1. The value of `j` at the end of the loop is `n + r`.
2. To find `j % n`, we calculate `(n + r) % n`.

Since `(n + r) % n` simplifies to `r` (because `n % n` is 0), the expression `j % n` evaluates to `r`.

Therefore, the print statement will output `2` followed by `r` (the value of `r`) followed by a space.

Output: **2 r (where r is the value of r)**
