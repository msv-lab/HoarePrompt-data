Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is less than 4, `curr` is `pres + paths[3] * (k - 3)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[3]`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`.**

Explanation: The line `ress = max(ress, curr)` updates `ress` to be the maximum value between its current value and `curr`. The values of `i`, `k`, `curr`, and `pres` remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
