Output State: `l` is the smallest index such that `D[l] + f >= right`, and `h` is the largest index such that `D[h] + f <= left`. 

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `l` will be the smallest index where the condition `D[l] + f >= right` is satisfied, and `h` will be the largest index where the condition `D[h] + f <= left` holds true. This is because the loop continues to narrow down the range between `l` and `h` until they converge to the boundary conditions specified.
