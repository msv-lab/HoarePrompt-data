Output State: **`k` is an integer, `b` is `p[b]` - 1, `s` is `p[s]` - 1**

Explanation: The code `s = p[s] - 1` updates the value of `s` to be `p[s] - 1`. The value of `b` remains unchanged as it is defined as `p[b] - 1` and is not affected by the assignment to `s`. The value of `k` also remains unchanged as it was initially defined as an integer and is not involved in the assignment operation.
