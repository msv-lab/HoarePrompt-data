Output State: **`k` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `r` is `r - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. The other variables (`k`, `n`, `ans`, and `res[c]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `r` being reduced by 1 from its previous value.
