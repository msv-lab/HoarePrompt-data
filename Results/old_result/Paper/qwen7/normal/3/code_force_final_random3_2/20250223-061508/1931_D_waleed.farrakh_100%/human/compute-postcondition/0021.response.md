Output State: `t` is 0, `idx` is equal to `2 * t` which is 4 (since `t` is 0), `n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer, `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, each tuple being `(n, x, y, arr)` where `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are as described above.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` becomes 0 because it was decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reached 0. The index `idx` will be 4 since it increments by 2 in each iteration and we start with `t` as 1, making it go through 3 iterations in total. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop. The list `test_cases` will contain `t` (which is 0) tuples, but since `t` is 0, `test_cases` will be an empty list.
