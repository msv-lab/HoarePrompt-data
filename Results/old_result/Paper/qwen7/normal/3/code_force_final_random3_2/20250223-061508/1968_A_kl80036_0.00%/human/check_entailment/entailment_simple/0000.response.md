### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized for each test case.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \).
   - It then sets \( y \) to be \( \frac{x}{2} \) using integer division.
   - Finally, it prints \( y \).

3. **Evaluation of the Solution**:
   - The goal is to maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
   - If \( y = \frac{x}{2} \), then \(\gcd(x, y)\) could be 1 (if \( x \) is odd) or greater than 1 (if \( x \) is even).
   - However, setting \( y = \frac{x}{2} \) does not necessarily maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). For instance, if \( x = 10 \):
     - \( y = 5 \): \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7\)
     - \( y = 4 \): \(\gcd(10, 4) + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6\)
     - \( y = 2 \): \(\gcd(10, 2) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4\)
     - Clearly, \( y = 5 \) gives a higher value than \( y = 4 \) or \( y = 2 \).

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider \( x = 10 \):
     - The given code would output \( y = 5 \).
     - However, a better choice could be \( y = 9 \):
       - \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\), which is greater than 7.
   - This shows that the solution provided does not always find the optimal \( y \).

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly solve the problem because it does not always find the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

### Response:
Correctness: **False**
