Postcondition: **`same` is 2, `num` is `ar[0]`, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is infinity, `ar` is a list of integers, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`. If the condition `ar[i] == num` is false, then `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[3]`, `i` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is 1, and the first element of `ar` is not equal to `num`.**
