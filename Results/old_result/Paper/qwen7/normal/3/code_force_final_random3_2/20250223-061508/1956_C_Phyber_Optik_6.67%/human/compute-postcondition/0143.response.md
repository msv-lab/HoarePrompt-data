Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `r` is any non-negative integer.
- `j` is defined as `j_prev + 1`, where `j_prev` was less than or equal to `n + r`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

Let's break it down:

1. The first argument to `print` is `2`, which is a constant and will be printed directly.
2. The second argument is `j % n`, which represents the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`.

Since `j` is defined as `j_prev + 1` and `j_prev` is less than or equal to `n + r`, `j` must also be less than or equal to `n + r`. Therefore, `j` can range from 1 up to `n + r` (inclusive).

When `j` is divided by `n`, the remainder (`j % n`) will be a value between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive). Specifically:
- If `j` is within the range `[1, n)`, then `j % n` will be `j` itself.
- If `j` is within the range `[n, n + r]`, then `j % n` will be `j - n`, which is a value between 0 and `r`.

Given the constraints, the exact value of `j % n` cannot be determined precisely without knowing the specific values of `n` and `j_prev`. However, we know it will be a valid remainder.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2 [remainder when j is divided by n]**
