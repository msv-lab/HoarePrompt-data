Based on the initial state provided:

- `minn` starts as `maxx + 1`.
- `maxx` is updated during the loop to be the maximum value it was set to.
- `mex` contains all the absolute differences between each element in `arr` and `minn`, starting from `minn` being `maxx + 1` up to `maxx + n`.
- For each iteration where `arr[i] > 0`, `minn` is appended to `mex`.

However, the `print()` statement in the code snippet does not specify any variables or values to be printed. Therefore, the output will simply be an empty line.

Output: **Output:**
