Output State: **`ans` is the value of `ans` plus `i` - 1, `tmp` is a list of integers that does not contain the previous value of `i`, `i` is the next element in the updated `tmp`**.

Explanation: The code subtracts `i - 1` from `y`. The value of `i` remains the same as the next element in the updated `tmp` list. The `ans` variable is updated by adding the original value of `i` to itself, but since the subtraction operation is performed afterward, `ans` effectively becomes `ans + i - 1`. The `tmp` list does not contain the previous value of `i` and `i` is now the next element in the updated `tmp`.
