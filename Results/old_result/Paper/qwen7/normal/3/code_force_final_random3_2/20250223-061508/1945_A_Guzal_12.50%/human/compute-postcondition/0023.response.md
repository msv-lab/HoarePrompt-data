To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
- The value of `k` depends on the condition `(b + c) % 3 != 0`.

Let's analyze the condition:

1. If `(b + c) % 3 != 0`:
   - `k` is updated to `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`.
   
2. Otherwise:
   - `k` remains unchanged as `a + (b + c) // 3`.

Since the actual values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `k`. However, we can describe it based on the given formula.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **a + (b + c) // 3 + 1 if (b + c) % 3 != 0, otherwise a + (b + c) // 3**
