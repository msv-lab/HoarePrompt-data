Output State: **`prev` is `curr`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `tree` is a list containing `s` and `curr`, `curr` is `nodes[s][0]`, and `nodes[curr][0]` is not equal to `prev`.**

Explanation: The code `prev = curr` updates the value of `prev` to be the current value of `curr`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
