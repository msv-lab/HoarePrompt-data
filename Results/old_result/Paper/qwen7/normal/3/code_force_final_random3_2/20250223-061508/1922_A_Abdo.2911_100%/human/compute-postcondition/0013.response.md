Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the value of `a[0]` is equal to the value of `b[0]`. The current value of `c[0]` is not equal to the value of `a[0]`. `possible` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are reassigned or their values altered by the `break` statement, the values of `i`, `n`, `a[0]`, `b[0]`, `c[0]`, and `possible` remain unchanged.
