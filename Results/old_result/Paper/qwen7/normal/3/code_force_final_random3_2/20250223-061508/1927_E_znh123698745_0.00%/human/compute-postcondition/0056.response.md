Output State: **`answer` has one more element which is `array[a[0]]`, `i` is now `i + 1`, and the loop continues with the next value of `i` within the range `1` to `n-1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `array[a[0]]` to the list `answer`. This means that the first element of the list `a` (denoted as `a[0]`) is used as an index to access an element from the list `array`, and this accessed element is appended to the list `answer`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues with the next value of `i` within the specified range.
