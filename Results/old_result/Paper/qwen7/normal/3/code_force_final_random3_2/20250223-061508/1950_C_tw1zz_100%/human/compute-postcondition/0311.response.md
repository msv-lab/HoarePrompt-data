Output State: **`h1` is '07', `m1` is equal to `m`, `h` is a string containing the hour part of the input, `time` is 'AM'**.

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. The values of `h1`, `m1`, and `h` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `h1` is still `'07'`, `m1` is still equal to `m`, `h` is still a string containing the hour part of the input, and `time` is now `'AM'`.
