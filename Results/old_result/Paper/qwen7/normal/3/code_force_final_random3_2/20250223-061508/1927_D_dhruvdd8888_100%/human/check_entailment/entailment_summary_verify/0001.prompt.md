You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of integers `nums` and handles a series of queries. For each query defined by indices `l` and `r`, it determines and prints a pair of indices based on the segments of `nums` identified during the initial pass through the list. If no valid segment is found, it prints `-1 -1`. The function does not return any value but modifies and uses predefined global variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `q`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Setting Up:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N`, the array itself, and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then processes each query.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment in `arr` that corresponds to the query range `[l, r]`.
   - `arr` is constructed to store segments where the value of the array changes. Each segment is a tuple `(start_index, end_index, value)`.

3. **Binary Search and Segment Handling:**
   - The binary search finds the segment in `arr` that starts at or before `l`.
   - Depending on the position of the start and end of this segment relative to `l` and `r`, the program decides whether to return a valid pair of indices or `-1 -1`.

### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Segment Construction:**
   - The segment array `arr` is built to capture transitions in the array values.
   - This helps in quickly identifying where the array values change.

2. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search to find the relevant segment.
   - It checks if the segment starts after `l` or ends before `r`. If so, it returns `-1 -1`.
   - If the segment starts within the query range but ends outside, it returns the start and the next index.
   - If the segment ends within the query range, it returns the start and the end.

### Testing the Logic

To ensure the logic is correct, let's consider some test cases:

#### Test Case 1:
- Array: `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`
- Queries: `[1, 5], [1, 2], [1, 3]`

- For `[1, 5]`: The segment is `[1, 2, 1]` and `[2, 3, 2]`. The answer should be `2 3` because `a_2 ≠ a_3`.
- For `[1, 2]`: The segment is `[1, 2, 1]`. No valid pair exists, so the answer is `-1 -1`.
- For `[1, 3]`: The segment is `[1, 2, 1]` and `[2, 3, 2]`. The answer should be `1 3` because `a_1 ≠ a_3`.

#### Test Case 2:
- Array: `[30, 20, 20, 10, 10, 20]`
- Queries: `[1, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 6], [3, 5]`

- For `[1, 2]`: The segment is `[1, 1, 30]` and `[1, 2, 20]`. The answer should be `1 2` because `a_1 ≠ a_2`.
- For `[2, 3]`: The segment is `[1, 2, 20]` and `[2, 3, 20]`. No valid pair exists, so the answer is `-1 -1`.
- For `[2, 4]`: The segment is `[1, 2, 20]` and `[2, 3, 20]` and `[3, 4, 10]`. The answer should be `1 3` because `a_1 ≠ a_3`.
- For `[2, 6]`: The segment is `[1, 2, 20]` and `[2, 3, 20]` and `[3, 4, 10]` and `[4, 5, 10]` and `[5, 6, 20]`. The answer should be `1 3` because `a_1 ≠ a_3`.
- For `[3, 5]`: The segment is `[3, 4, 10]` and `[4, 5, 10]`. The answer should be `3 4` because `a_3 ≠ a_4`.

### Conclusion

After testing the logic with multiple test cases, the program correctly identifies pairs of indices for each query. Therefore, the given program is correct.
