Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t-2` with two elements removed (one being `v3` and the other being `v1`), `ops` is a list containing tuples where either `(v1, v2)` or `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are included, `v3` is assigned the value of `q(0)`, `v1` and `v2` are assigned the values of `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and `len(vx)` must be greater than 2; `ops` now includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` added to its end.**

Explanation: The code appends the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` to the list `ops`. Since `v3` and `v1` are already defined and their values are known (as they are derived from the function `q`), adding these tuples to `ops` does not change the values of `v3` or `v1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
