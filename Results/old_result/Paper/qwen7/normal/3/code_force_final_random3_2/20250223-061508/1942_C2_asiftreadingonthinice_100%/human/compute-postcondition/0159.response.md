Output State: **`i` is 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is as it was, `tmp` is now a list containing the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given that `i` is initially 2, after executing the code, `i` becomes 3 (since the index operation `a[i - 1]` would now refer to `a[2]`). The value appended to `tmp` is specifically `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`. All other variables (`a`, `ans`, and `tmp`) retain their previous states except for `tmp`, which now includes the new element.
