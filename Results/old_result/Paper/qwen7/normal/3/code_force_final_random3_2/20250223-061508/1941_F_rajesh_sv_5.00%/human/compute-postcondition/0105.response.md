Output State: **`ans` remains the minimum value it has been updated to throughout the entire loop execution, `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged, `l` is updated to the value returned by `bisect_right(D, left - f)`, `h` is assigned the value `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, and `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is updated to `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is updated to `D[mid + 1] + f**.

Explanation: The code updates `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` to the values of `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` respectively, where `mid` is the midpoint between `l` and `h`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
