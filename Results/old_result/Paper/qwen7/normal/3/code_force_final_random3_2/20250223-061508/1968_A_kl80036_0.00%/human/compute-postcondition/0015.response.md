Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` between 2 and 1000 inclusive, computes `x // 2` (integer division), and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.**
