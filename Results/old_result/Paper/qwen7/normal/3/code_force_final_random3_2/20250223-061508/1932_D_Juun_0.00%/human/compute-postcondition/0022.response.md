Output State: **`trumps` is the same as before, `answers` is the same as before, `rank` is the first element of `card`, `suit` is the second element of `card`.**

Explanation: The code `rank, suit = card` unpacks the tuple `card` into two variables, `rank` and `suit`. It assigns the first element of `card` to `rank` and the second element of `card` to `suit`. The values of `trumps` and `answers` remain unchanged from their initial state.
