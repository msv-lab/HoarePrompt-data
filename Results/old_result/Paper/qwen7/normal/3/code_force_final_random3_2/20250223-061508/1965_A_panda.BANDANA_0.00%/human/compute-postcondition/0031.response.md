Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three pieces of information: a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It returns different outputs based on the values of t, n, and the list a_i for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes a count of test cases (t), the number of piles (n), and the number of stones in each pile (a_i). The function processes these inputs and produces an output for each test case without needing to be explicitly called with parameters inside its definition.
