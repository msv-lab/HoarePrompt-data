Output State: **`i` is less than `l`, `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `x` is the maximum value encountered in `nums` from index 0 to `i` (inclusive), `y` is equal to `nums[i]`, `nums` is a list of integers created by splitting the input string, and the current value of `nums[i]` is less than `y`.**

This output state reflects that the value of `y` has been updated to `nums[i]`, while all other conditions and variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
