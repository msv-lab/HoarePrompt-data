Output State: **`cnt` is 1; `ans` is a list where the last element is the previous second last element minus 1 and one less than the previous last element**.

Explanation: The code appends to the list `ans` a new element which is the previous last element minus 1. Initially, the last element of `ans` was the second last element minus 1. After appending, the new last element is one less than what the previous last element was, which itself was one less than the second last element. Therefore, the new last element is the second last element minus 1 minus 1, which simplifies to the second last element minus 2. However, since we only know the relationship for the last two elements, we can express the updated state as described.
