Output State: **`S` is a list containing a sublist `[last_element_of_S + 1, last_element_of_S]` if `s` is '0', or `[last_element_of_S, last_element_of_S + 1]` otherwise; `x` is `last_element_of_S + 1`; `y` is `last_element_of_S`.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = S[-1]` unpacks the last sublist of `S` into `x` and `y`. The last sublist of `S` is either `[last_element_of_S + 1, last_element_of_S]` if `s` is '0', or `[last_element_of_S, last_element_of_S + 1]` otherwise. After unpacking, `x` takes the first element of this sublist and `y` takes the second element. Therefore, `x` is `last_element_of_S + 1` and `y` is `last_element_of_S`. The structure of `S` remains unchanged.
