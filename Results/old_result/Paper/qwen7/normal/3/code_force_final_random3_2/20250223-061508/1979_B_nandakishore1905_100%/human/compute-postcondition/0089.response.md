Output State: **`p` is the length of the string `l`, which is the binary representation of the integer value of `f` without the '0b' prefix; `q` is 2; `f` is `f - 2`**.

Explanation: The value of `f` is decreased by 2, while the other variables remain unchanged. The length of the string `l` and the value of `q` stay the same as they were not affected by the operation.
