Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `__name__` is `__main__`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers where each element is the integer from the input corresponding to its index.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `arr` by converting each of the first `x` integers from the input into integers. The original values of `t`, `__name__`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the structure of `arr` (as a list of string representations) remain unchanged, except that `arr` is now a list of integers instead of strings.
