Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ans` is 0
   - `i` is equal to `n`
   - `k` is decreased by `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`
   - `a[i]` is `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop condition `i < n` will be false, and the loop will not execute again unless `i` is incremented or `n` is changed.
   - However, the problem specifies that we should only adjust the states of objects in the loop head. Therefore, we cannot change `i` or `n` directly from within this step.

5. **Adjust the States Based on the Loop Head Variables**:
   - Since `i` is equal to `n` and the loop condition requires `i < n`, the loop will not execute again without changing `i` or `n`.
   - We need to ensure that the loop can potentially execute again by adjusting the states of `i` and `n` such that `i < n` holds true.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n` to allow the loop to potentially execute again. Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, we need to decrease `i` or increase `n` to satisfy the condition `i < n`.

However, based on the problem constraints and the fact that we can only adjust the loop head variables, the most straightforward adjustment would be to set `i` to `n - 1` (assuming `n` remains unchanged).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is decreased by `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `a[i]` is `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`**
