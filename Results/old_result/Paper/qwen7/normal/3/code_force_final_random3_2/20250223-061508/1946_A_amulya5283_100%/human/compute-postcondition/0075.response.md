Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations. Therefore, `i` is now equal to `mdx + n`, meaning it has reached the end of the list `a`. The variable `res` contains the total count of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]`. The other variables (`n`, `mdx`) remain unchanged from their final values after the last iteration, with `mdx` being `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
