Postcondition: **`same` is either 4 or 2, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 2, `i` is increased by 1, `num` is `ar[i]`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`. If `ar[i] == num`, then `same` becomes either 4 or 2. Otherwise, `same` becomes 1, `minn` becomes the minimum of `minn` and 3, and `i` is increased by 1.**
