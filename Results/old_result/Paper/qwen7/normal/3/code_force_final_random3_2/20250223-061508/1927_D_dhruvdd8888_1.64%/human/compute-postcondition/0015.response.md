Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, `num` is equal to `nums[0]`, and `arr` contains tuples (2, 1, num) and (1, 1, num).**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to the list `arr`. Initially, `s` is 0, `i` is 1, and `num` is equal to `nums[0]`. After appending, `arr` now contains two tuples: `(1, 1, num)` from the previous state and the new tuple `(1 + 0, 2, num)` which simplifies to `(1, 2, num)`. The values of `N`, `i`, `s`, and `num` remain unchanged except for `i` which is incremented by 1.
