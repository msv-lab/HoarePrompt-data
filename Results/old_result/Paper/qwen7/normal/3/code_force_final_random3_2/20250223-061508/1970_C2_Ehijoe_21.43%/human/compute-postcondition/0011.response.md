Output State: **`empty` is True, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing one tuple (u, v), `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `nodes` is a defaultdict where all values are initially lists, `i` is 3, `nodes[u]` contains the value `v`, and `nodes[v]` now contains the value `u`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `nodes` dictionary such that the key `v` now has the value `u` appended to its list. All other variables remain unchanged.
