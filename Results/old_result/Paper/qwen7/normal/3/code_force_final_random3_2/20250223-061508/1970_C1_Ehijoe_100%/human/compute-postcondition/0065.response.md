Output State: `prev` is equal to `curr`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `tree` is a list containing `s` and all elements traversed until `curr` equals `e`, and `curr` is equal to `e`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `prev` will be set to the last value of `curr` (which is `e`), `s` remains as the first element from the `ends` list, `e` remains as the second element from the `ends` list, `tree` contains all the nodes traversed from `s` to `e` inclusive, and `curr` is finally equal to `e`.
