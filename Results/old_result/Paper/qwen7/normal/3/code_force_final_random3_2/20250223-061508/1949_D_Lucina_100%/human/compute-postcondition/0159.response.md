Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `nx` is 'x', `j` is 1, `n` is 4**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, `xx[i][j - 1]` is equivalent to `xx[1][0]`, which is not '?'. Since no specific value for `xx[1][0]` is given, we assume it is 'x' (a common character used in such examples). Therefore, `nx` becomes 'x'. The values of `total`, `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged.
