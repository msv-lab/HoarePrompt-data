Output State: **`resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0, `pathb` must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and the condition `k < i + 1` is true. and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the `break` statement is executed, it means we are breaking out of the loop or conditional block we were inside. However, the `break` statement itself does not change the values of the variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `pres`, `pathb`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition `k < i + 1` remains true.
