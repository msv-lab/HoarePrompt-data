Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The condition for the loop is `i < n - 1`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `empty` is True.
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5.
   - `t` is 1.
   - `edges` is a list containing one tuple (u, v).
   - `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n.
   - `nodes` is a defaultdict where all values are initially lists.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `nodes[u]` now contains the values `[v]` and `nodes[v]` now contains the value `[u]`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop condition is `i < n - 1`, the loop will execute if `i` is less than `n - 1`.
   - After the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be updated to `i + 1`, so `i` becomes 1.
   - All other variables (`empty`, `n`, `t`, `edges`, `start`, `nodes`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`empty` is True, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing one tuple (u, v), `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `nodes` is a defaultdict where all values are initially lists, `i` is 1**
