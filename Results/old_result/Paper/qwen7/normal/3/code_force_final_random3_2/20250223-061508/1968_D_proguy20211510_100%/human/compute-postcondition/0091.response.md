Output State: **`i` is length_of_pathb + 1, `preb` is 0, `pathb` is a list, `len(paths)` is a constant, `pres` is pres + paths[length_of_pathb] + paths[i], `curr` is pres + paths[i] * (k - i), `ress` is the maximum of ress and curr, `ress` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr`.**

Explanation: The line `ress = max(ress, curr)` updates the value of `ress` to be the maximum of its current value and `curr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
