Output State: **`mid` is equal to `l` + (`h` - `l`) // 2, `l` is less than `h`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`**.

The code `mid = l + (h - l) // 2` updates the value of `mid` to be the same as its previous value, which is already defined as `l + (h - l) // 2`. The other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `l`, and `h`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
