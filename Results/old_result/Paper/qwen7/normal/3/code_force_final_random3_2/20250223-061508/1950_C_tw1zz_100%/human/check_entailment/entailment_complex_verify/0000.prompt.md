You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

    #State: Output State: The loop will execute as many times as the integer input provided by the user. After all iterations, the output state will be as follows:
    #
    #- `h1` will be the 12-hour format representation of the hour part of the last input time, with 'AM' or 'PM' appended based on whether the hour is before or after noon.
    #- `m1` will be equal to the minute part of the last input time.
    #- `time` will be 'AM' if the hour part of the last input time is '01', '02', '03', or '04', and 'PM' otherwise.
    #
    #In summary, the final output will reflect the 12-hour format of the last processed time along with its minutes and AM/PM indicator.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple time inputs in the 24-hour format and converts them into the 12-hour format with AM/PM indicators. It prints out each converted time and updates the variables `h1`, `m1`, and `time` to reflect the last processed time in the 12-hour format. After processing all inputs, the final state includes `h1` as the 12-hour formatted hour, `m1` as the minute part, and `time` as either 'AM' or 'PM'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the conversion of hours correctly for times between 13:00 and 23:59. Specifically, it fails to convert hours greater than 12 correctly to the 12-hour format. For example, the input `23:45` should be converted to `11:45 PM`, but the program incorrectly prints `11:45 AM`. This is evident from the hardcoded conditions for each hour, which do not account for the full range of 13 to 23. A more efficient and correct approach would be to use the modulo operation to handle this conversion, such as `h1 = str((int(h) - 12) % 12 + 1)` for hours greater than 12, and set `time = 'PM'` if `int(h) >= 12`.
