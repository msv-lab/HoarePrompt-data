Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` is `True`
- `i` is `1`
- `string` is an input string
- `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string
- `n` is `1`
- `x` is the first character of the input string
- `count` is `1`
- `count2` is either `0` or `1`
- `j` is `1`
- The first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of `s`

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.

Given that:
- `j` is `1`
- `string[:j]` will be the substring from the start of the string up to index `1`, which includes only the first character of the string.
- `string[j:]` will be the substring starting from index `1` to the end of the string, which includes all characters after the first character.

Therefore, the output will be the first character of the string followed by the rest of the string.

Output: **string[0], string[1:]**
