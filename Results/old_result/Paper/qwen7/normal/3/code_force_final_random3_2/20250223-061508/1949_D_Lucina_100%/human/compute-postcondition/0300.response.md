Output State: **`i` is less than `4`, `n` is `3`, `nx` is either `'SFSS'` or `'FFSS'`, `j` is `3`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the end of the string stored in `nx`. Since `nx` was either `'SF'` or `'FF'`, appending 'S' changes it to either `'SFSS'` or `'FFSS'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
