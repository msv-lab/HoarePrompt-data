Output State: **`arr` is `[i+2, i+1]`, `item` is `i+1`, `mini` is `i+1`, `res` is `input()`**

Explanation: The line `mini = item` assigns the value of `item` (which is `i+1`) to `mini`. All other variables (`arr`, `res`, and `mini` if `res` was previously set to `'>'` and then `res` became `input()`) remain unchanged from their initial or updated states.
