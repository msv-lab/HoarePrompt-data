Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is assigned the value of `count`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- The character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`.
- `done` is `True`.
- The most internal loop or if statement is broken out.

We need to determine what will be printed with the statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.

From the information given, we know:
- `string[:j]` will contain the substring from the start of the string up to but not including the character at index `j`.
- `string[j:]` will contain the substring starting from the character at index `j` to the end of the string.

Since no specific values for `string` or `count` are provided, we can only describe the substrings in terms of their indices.

Output: **string[:count], string[count:]**
