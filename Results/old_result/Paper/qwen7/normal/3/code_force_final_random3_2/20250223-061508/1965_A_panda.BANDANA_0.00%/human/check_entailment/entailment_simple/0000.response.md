Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the initial configuration of stone piles. Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move to ensure their victory.

2. The provided solution checks if any pile has exactly 1 stone. If there is at least one pile with 1 stone, it immediately concludes that Bob wins. Otherwise, it concludes that Alice wins.

3. This logic is based on the fact that if any pile has exactly 1 stone, the player whose turn it is can remove 1 stone from that pile and all other non-empty piles, thus forcing the opponent into a losing position. Conversely, if no pile has exactly 1 stone, the player can always reduce the size of the smallest non-empty pile to 1, ensuring that the opponent is eventually forced into a losing position.

4. The solution correctly implements this strategy by checking if `1` is in the list of piles. If it is, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

5. The code iterates through each test case, reads the necessary inputs, and applies the winning condition check without any errors or logical flaws.

6. Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the solution appears to handle all cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
