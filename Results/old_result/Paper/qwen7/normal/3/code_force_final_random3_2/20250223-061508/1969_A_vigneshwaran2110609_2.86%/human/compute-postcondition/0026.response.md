Output State: **`i` is 50, `n` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is an input integer, `flag` remains unchanged or is True if any `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1` for any `i` in the range of `x`.**

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `x` now holds the integer value entered by the user. The values of `i`, `n`, and `flag` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for `flag` regarding the list `l` remains the same.
