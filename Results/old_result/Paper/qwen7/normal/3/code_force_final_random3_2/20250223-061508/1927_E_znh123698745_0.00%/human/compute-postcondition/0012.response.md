Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and \((-1)^i\) is equal to 1, `a[0]` is 2, `answer` is updated with the element at index `a[0]` from `array`.**

Explanation: The code `a[0] += 1` increments the value of `a[0]` by 1. Given that `a[0]` was initially equal to the element at index `a[0]` from `array`, and since `a[0]` is now incremented by 1, `a[0]` is now 2. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
