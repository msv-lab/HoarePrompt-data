Output State: **`h1` is '10', `m1` is equal to `m`, `h` and `m` are updated to the input values split by ':', `time` is 'AM'**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. The values of `h1`, `m1`, `h`, `m`, and the original state of `time` (which was an empty string) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged values along with the new assignment to `time`.
