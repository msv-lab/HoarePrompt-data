Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. Let's consider a few test cases to illustrate this:

1. **Test Case**: 
   ```
   4
   2 4 1
   ```

   According to the problem description, we need to find an array `a` such that:
   - \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 2 \)
   - \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 4 \)
   - \( a_4 \bmod a_3 = 1 \)

   The current implementation sets `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, which does not guarantee that the conditions will be met. For example, if `arr = [2, 4, 1]`, setting `ans[2] = ans[3] - 1` would not necessarily satisfy \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 4 \).

   A correct approach would involve ensuring that each `a_i` is chosen such that the modulo condition is satisfied. One possible correct solution could be:
   - \( a_1 = 5 \)
   - \( a_2 = 5 \)
   - \( a_3 = 5 \)
   - \( a_4 = 9 \)

   This satisfies:
   - \( 5 \bmod 5 = 0 \neq 2 \)
   - \( 5 \bmod 5 = 0 \neq 4 \)
   - \( 9 \bmod 5 = 4 \)

   Therefore, the current implementation fails to meet the conditions for this test case, making the program incorrect.
