Output State: `trumps` is an empty list.

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `trumps` will be an empty list because the loop continues to run as long as `trumps` is not empty. Since the loop removes two elements from `trumps` in each iteration (with `trumps.pop()` called twice), eventually `trumps` will become empty, causing the loop to terminate. At this point, there are no more elements left to pop from `trumps`, so it remains empty.
