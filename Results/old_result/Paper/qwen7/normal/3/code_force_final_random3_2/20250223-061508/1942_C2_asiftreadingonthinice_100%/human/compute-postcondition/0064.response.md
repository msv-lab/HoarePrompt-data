Output State: **`tmp` is a non-empty list with length `len(tmp) - 1`, `y` is an integer equal to `y - (i - 1)`, `i` is the next element in `tmp`, `ans` is increased by the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code subtracts `i - 1` from `y`. The value of `i` remains the same as the next element in `tmp`. The value of `ans` was increased by the value of `i` before this line of code, but the code itself does not modify `ans`. Therefore, `ans` retains its previous value plus the original value of `i`.
