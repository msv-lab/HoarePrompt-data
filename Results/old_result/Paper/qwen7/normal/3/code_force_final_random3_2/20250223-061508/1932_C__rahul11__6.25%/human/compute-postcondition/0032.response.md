Output State: **`k` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `l` is 1, `r` is `r - 1`**

Explanation: The code `ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD` updates the value of `ans` by performing integer division by `arr[l]` and then taking modulo `MOD`. Since `l` is 1 (as given in the initial state), the updated value of `ans` is `ans // arr[1] % MOD`. The values of `k`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `l` is explicitly set to 1.
