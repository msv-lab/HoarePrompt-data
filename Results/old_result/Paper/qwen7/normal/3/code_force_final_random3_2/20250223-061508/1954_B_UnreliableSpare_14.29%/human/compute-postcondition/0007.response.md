Output State: **`flag` is False, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `arr[i]` is not equal to the previous value of `arr[i - 1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are reassigned or their values altered by the `break` statement, the values of `flag`, `i`, `n`, and the condition involving `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` remain unchanged.
