Based on the initial state provided:

- `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.
- `pl` is a list of unique elements in the order they appeared in `palka` initially.

To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the components involved:

1. `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in their original order.
2. For each `j` in `pl`, if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, we take `d[j] // 3` and add it to `shapes`.

Since the exact values of `d` and `palka` are not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `shapes`. However, we know that `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for those `j` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

Therefore, the print statement will output the computed value of `shapes`.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the sum of d[j] // 3 for all j in pl where d[j] >= 3)**
