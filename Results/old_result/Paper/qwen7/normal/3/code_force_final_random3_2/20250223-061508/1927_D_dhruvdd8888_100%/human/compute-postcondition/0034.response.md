Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `nums` is a list with at least `N + 1` elements, `l` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split, `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))` calculates the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` should be inserted to keep the list `arr` sorted. However, since `arr` is initially an empty list, the `bisect_left` function will return `0` because the tuple would be inserted at the beginning of the list. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
