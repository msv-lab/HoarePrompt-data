Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is currently 0.
   - `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration (assuming no other operations change `j`), at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `n` must be greater than 1 because `j` starts from 0 and needs to be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `j` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

So, the final state is:
State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
