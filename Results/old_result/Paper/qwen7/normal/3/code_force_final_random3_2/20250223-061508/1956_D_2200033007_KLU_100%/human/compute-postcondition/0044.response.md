Functionality: **The function `make_stairs` processes a list `arr` starting from index `start_index` to determine if a "stair" pattern can be formed. If a "stair" pattern cannot be formed, it attempts to create one by setting consecutive elements in `arr` to the value of `i`. The function does not return any value.**

- If the initial segment of `arr` starting from `start_index` up to `start_index + i` already forms a "stair" pattern (where each element equals its index), the function does nothing and returns.
- If `i` is 0, it appends a tuple `(start_index, start_index)` to `res` and sets `arr[start_index]` to 1.
- Otherwise, it recursively tries to form a "stair" pattern by decrementing `i` and appending operations to `res` until a valid "stair" pattern is achieved or `i` becomes 0. During this process, it sets the elements in the range `[start_index, start_index + i]` to the value of `i`.
