Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):`. This means the loop variable `c` will take values from 'a' to 'z'.

2. **Determine the initial state of `c`**: Since the loop starts iterating over the range from 'a' to 'z', the initial value of `c` should be 'a'. 

3. **Check the other variables involved**: The other variables mentioned in the problem are `decoded`, `mapping`, and `encoded`. However, these variables are not directly used in the loop head and their states do not affect whether the loop can execute.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**: Based on the loop head, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `c`. It should be set to 'a' to start the loop.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `c` being set to 'a'.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`c` is 'a'**
