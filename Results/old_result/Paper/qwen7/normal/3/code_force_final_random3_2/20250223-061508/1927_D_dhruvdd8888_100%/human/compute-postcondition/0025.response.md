Output State: **`i` is 2, `N` must be at least 2, `s` is 2, `arr` contains the tuples `(2, 1, num)`, `(2, 1, num)`, and `(2, 1, num)` where `num` is equal to `nums[2]`**.

Explanation: The code `s = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `s`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 2, `N` must be at least 2, `s` is now 2, and `arr` remains as it was initially defined.
