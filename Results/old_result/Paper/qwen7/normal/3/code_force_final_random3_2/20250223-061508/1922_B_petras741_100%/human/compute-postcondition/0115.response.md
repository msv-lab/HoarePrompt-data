Output State: **`w` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `q` of length `n + 1` where each element is set to 0. The other variables (`w`, `n`, `t`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
