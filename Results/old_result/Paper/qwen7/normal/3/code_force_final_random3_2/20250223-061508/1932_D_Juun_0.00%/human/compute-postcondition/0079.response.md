Output State: `suits` is an empty dictionary, `trumps` is an empty list, and `answers` is a list containing strings formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump' for each iteration executed.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `trumps` is not empty. After each iteration, two elements are popped from `trumps`, and these actions continue until `trumps` becomes empty. At this point, the loop terminates. Therefore, after all iterations, `trumps` will be an empty list. The `suits` dictionary remains unchanged as it was never modified within the loop. The `answers` list accumulates the printed statements from each iteration, so it will contain the formatted strings for all executed iterations.
