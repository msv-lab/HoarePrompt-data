Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This sets `t` to be an integer representing the number of test cases. The initial values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
