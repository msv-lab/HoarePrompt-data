Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `count` is 0, `n` is the first element of the next `test_case`, `x` is the second element of the next `test_case`, `y` is the third element of the next `test_case`, `arr` is the fourth element of the next `test_case`, `freq` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `arr` is the fourth element of the next `test_case` and contains at least one element; `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x; `ry` is a % y; `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y); `count` remains unchanged; `current_pair` is either incremented in frequency by 1 or added to `freq` with a count of 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `arr` is the fifth element of the next `test_case` and contains at least one element; `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x; `ry` is a % y; `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y); `count` is increased by either `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is found in `freq`, otherwise `count` is increased by 1; `freq[current_pair]` is set to either `freq[rx, ry] + 1` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, or 1 if `(rx, ry)` is not in `freq`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `arr` is the fifth element of the next `test_case` and contains at least one element; `a` is the value of `arr`; `rx` is ((-a % x + x) % x); `ry` is a % y; `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y); `freq[current_pair]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether `current_pair` is already present in `freq`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
