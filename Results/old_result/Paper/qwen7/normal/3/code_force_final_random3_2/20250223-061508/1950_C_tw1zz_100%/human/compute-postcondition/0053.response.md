Output State: **`h1` is '09', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'AM', and `h` is not equal to '08'.**

The code assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. This changes the value of `time` but does not affect the values of `h1`, `m1`, or `h`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
