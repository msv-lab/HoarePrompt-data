Postcondition: `trumps` remains the same if `suit` is not equal to `trump`. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` is updated to the value of `rank`. Additionally, `answers` either remains the same or contains one more element `' '.join([('hearts', rank), ('diamonds', rank)])` depending on whether `suits[suit]` is `None` or not. If `suits[suit]` is not `None`, it is set to `None`; otherwise, it is set to `rank`. `rank` is the first element of `card`, and `suit` is the second element of `card`.
