Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n):` statement. The only variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `bm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[b] * k + bp`.
   - `sm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `s` is `p[s] - 1`.
   - `sp` is increased by `a[s]`.
   - `bp` is increased by `a[b]`.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, it stays the same.

Given these points, the only variables that need adjustment are `i` and `n`.

- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Since `n` is greater than 0, it will still be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `n` remains greater than 0.

So, the final state is:
State: **`bm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[b] * k + bp`; `sm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 0; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `sp` is increased by `a[s]`; `bp` is increased by `a[b]`; `i` is `i + 1`**.
