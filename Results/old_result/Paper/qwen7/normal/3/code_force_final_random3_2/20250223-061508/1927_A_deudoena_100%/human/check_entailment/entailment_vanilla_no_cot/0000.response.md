Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not accurately calculate the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white. The current implementation only considers the first and last black cells and calculates a fixed offset without considering the possibility of multiple segments needing to be painted.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    # Find the first occurrence of 'B'
    start = None
    for i, cell in enumerate(s):
        if cell == 'B':
            start = i
            break
    
    # Find the last occurrence of 'B'
    end = None
    for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == 'B':
            end = i
            break
    
    # If there are no black cells, the entire strip is already white
    if start is None:
        return 0
    
    # Calculate the minimum length of the segment
    return end - start + 1
```

This corrected version properly identifies the first and last black cells and calculates the minimum segment length needed to turn all cells white.
