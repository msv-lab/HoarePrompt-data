### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads input from standard input using `[*open(0)][1:]`, which is correct for reading multiple test cases.

2. **Variable Extraction**:
   - For each test case, it extracts `k`, `x`, and `a` from the input string using `map(int, s.split())`. This is correct as per the problem statement.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks different conditions based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

4. **Case 1: \( x < k - 1 \)**:
   - If `x < k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 1`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
     - **Reasoning**:
       - If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can afford to lose up to `x` times in a row because he can always bet 1 coin after a loss without exceeding his current coins. After `x` losses, he will have at least `x + 1` coins, allowing him to continue betting and eventually accumulate more coins.
     - **Correctness**: This logic is correct.

5. **Case 2: \( x == k - 1 \)**:
   - If `x == k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 2`.
     - **Reasoning**:
       - If `x == k - 1`, Sasha can afford to lose up to `x` times in a row. After `x` losses, he will have at least `x + 2` coins, allowing him to continue betting and eventually accumulate more coins.
     - **Correctness**: This logic is correct.

6. **Case 3: \( x > k - 1 \)**:
   - If `x > k - 1`, it calculates `z` as `k - 2` and iterates over a range `x - k + 3` to update `z`.
     - **Reasoning**:
       - If `x > k - 1`, Sasha needs a more complex strategy to ensure he can recover from potential losses. The calculation of `z` seems to be an attempt to find a minimum number of coins required to ensure he can recover from `x` consecutive losses.
     - **Correctness**:
       - The logic here is more complex. Let's verify the formula:
         - The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is used to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to ensure recovery from `x` consecutive losses.
         - This formula ensures that even if Sasha loses `x` times in a row, he can still recover and continue betting.
     - **Verification**:
       - The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is correct for ensuring Sasha can recover from `x` consecutive losses. It effectively calculates the minimum number of coins needed to cover the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times in a row.

7. **Final Check**:
   - If `a >= z`, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
     - **Reasoning**:
       - This final check ensures that Sasha has enough initial coins to start the strategy and recover from potential losses.
     - **Correctness**: This logic is correct.

### Conclusion

After re-analyzing the program, we can confirm that it correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve his goal of obtaining any number of coins. The program handles all edge cases and ensures that Sasha can recover from potential losses based on the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
