Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing one more element 'Alice' than before, `i` is `test_cases`**.

Explanation: The code `answers.append('Alice')` adds the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. The lists `clues` and the variable `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
