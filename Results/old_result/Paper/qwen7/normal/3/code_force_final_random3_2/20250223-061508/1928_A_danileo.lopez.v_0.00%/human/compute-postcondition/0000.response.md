Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `t` remains within this range after the input is taken. All other variables (`a` and `b`) remain unchanged and are still within their respective ranges, but they are not affected by this line of code.
