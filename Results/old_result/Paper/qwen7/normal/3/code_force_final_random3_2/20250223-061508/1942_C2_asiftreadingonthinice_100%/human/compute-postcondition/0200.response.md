Output State: **`ans` is the value of `ans` plus `i`, `tmp` is a list of integers that does not contain the previous value of `i`, `i` is the next element in the updated `tmp`**.

This means that `ans` has been incremented by the value of `i`, `tmp` remains a list of integers without the previous value of `i`, and `i` is now set to the next element in the updated `tmp`.
