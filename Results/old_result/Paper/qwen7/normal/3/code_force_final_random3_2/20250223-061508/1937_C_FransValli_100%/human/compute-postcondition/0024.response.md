Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), meaning `i` will take values from `1` to `n-1`.
3. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**:
   - From the given state, `n` is equal to the final value of `i`.
   - Initially, `i` is not defined, but it will start from `1` because the loop starts with `range(1, n)`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means:
- `i` should start from `1`.
- `n` should be at least `1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`.

Since `n` is equal to the final value of `i`, and the loop starts with `i = 1`, `n` must be at least `1` for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be `1`.
- `n` must be at least `1`.

So, the final state adjustment is:
State: **`arr` is [0], `n` must be at least 1, `maxi` is 0**
