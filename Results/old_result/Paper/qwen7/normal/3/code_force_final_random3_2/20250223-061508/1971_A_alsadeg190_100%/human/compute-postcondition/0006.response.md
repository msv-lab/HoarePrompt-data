Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is 0.
- `x` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
- `x` is greater than or equal to `y`.

The `print(y, x)` statement will print the values of `y` and `x`.

Since the exact values of `y` and `x` are not specified beyond the conditions they must satisfy, the output will be the values of `y` and `x` as obtained from the input.

Output: **y, x (where y and x are integers with x â‰¥ y and both obtained from the input)**
