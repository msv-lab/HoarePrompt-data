Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program can be optimized and simplified significantly. The current implementation uses multiple `if-elif` statements to convert 24-hour format to 12-hour format, which is inefficient and error-prone. Here's a more concise and correct version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = input().split(':')
        h = int(h)
        if h > 12:
            h -= 12
            time = 'PM'
        else:
            time = 'AM' if h != 0 else '12'
        print(f'{h:02}:{m} {time}')
```

This version correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour to 12-hour format and outputs the time in the required format. The original program was incorrect because it did not handle all edge cases properly and was overly verbose.
