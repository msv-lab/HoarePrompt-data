Functionality: **The function reads multiple lines of input, each containing three integers \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \). Based on the values of \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \), it prints either 'YES' or 'NO'. After processing all input lines, it leaves the remaining unprocessed lines in the input buffer and updates \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \) to their last read values. The function does not return any value.**
