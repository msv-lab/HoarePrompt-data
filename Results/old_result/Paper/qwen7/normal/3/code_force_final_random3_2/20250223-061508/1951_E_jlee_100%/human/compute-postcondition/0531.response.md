Output State: **`done` is `True`, `count` is equal to `j`, `count2` is 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the values of `done`, `count`, and `count2` remain unchanged.
