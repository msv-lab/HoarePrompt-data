Output State: The value of `i` remains 1, `n` must be at least 3, and `x` is an input string. After all iterations of the loop, the following conditions hold:

- For each `j` from 2 to `n`, if `x[j-1]` is 'F', then `a[j]` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence of 'F' at position `j-1`.
- For each `j` from 2 to `n`, if `x[j-1]` is 'S', then `b[j]` will be incremented by 2 for each occurrence of 'S' at position `j-1`.

In summary, `a[j]` will count the number of 'F's preceding position `j` in the string `x`, and `b[j]` will count twice the number of 'S's preceding position `j` in the string `x`.
