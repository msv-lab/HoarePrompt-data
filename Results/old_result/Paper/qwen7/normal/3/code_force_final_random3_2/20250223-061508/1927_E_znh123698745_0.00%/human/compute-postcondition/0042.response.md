Output State: **`i` is an integer, and \((-1)^i\) is equal to 1; `answer` has an element appended from `array[a[0]]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `array[a[0]]` to the list `answer`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `array`, `a`, or `answer`. Therefore, the only change is that `answer` now contains an additional element, which is `array[a[0]]`. The value of `i` and the property \((-1)^i\) being equal to 1 remain unchanged.
