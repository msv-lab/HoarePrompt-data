Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of n-1 integers, and `n`, which is an integer representing the length of the list plus one. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element is calculated based on the formula `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` starting from `i = n - 2` down to `i = 0`, and the last element `ans[n-1]` is not defined as there is no `ans[n]`.**
