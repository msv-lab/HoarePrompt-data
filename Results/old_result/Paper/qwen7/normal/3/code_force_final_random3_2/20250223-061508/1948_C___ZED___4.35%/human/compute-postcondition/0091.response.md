Based on the initial state provided:

- `no_path` is `False`
- `k` is `3`
- `n` must be an integer such that `1 < n - 1`, which means `n` is any integer greater than 2
- The current value of `a[k]` is not `'>'`

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(k)
```

Since `k` is explicitly stated to be `3`, the print statement will simply output the value of `k`.

Output: **3**
