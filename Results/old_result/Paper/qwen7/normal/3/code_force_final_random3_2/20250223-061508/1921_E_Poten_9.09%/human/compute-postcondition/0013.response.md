Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `answers` is ['Bob'], `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces. The first element of `clues` is not 1, and the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`. Additionally, the current value of `clues[2]` is even and the current value of `clues[4]` is even, or the current value of `clues[2]` is odd and the current value of `clues[4]` is odd. The value of `clues[3]` is equal to the value of `clues[5]`.**

Explanation: The code appends 'Bob' to the `answers` list. The length of `test_cases`, the initial value of `i`, and the properties of the `clues` list remain unchanged. Therefore, these conditions are still valid post-execution.
