Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` and then `t` integers `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it constructs a string `ans` based on whether `n` is even or odd and prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string `ans`. The function does not return any value but prints output for each test case.**
