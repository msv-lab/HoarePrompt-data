Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by simply printing `x // 2` for each test case. However, the goal is to find an integer `y` (where `1 \le y < x`) such that the sum `\gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized. 

Let's analyze the logic:
- For any `x`, `x // 2` is always less than `x` and is a potential candidate for `y`.
- However, `x // 2` does not necessarily maximize `\gcd(x, y) + y`. For example, consider `x = 10`. The value `x // 2 = 5` gives `\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10`, but `y = 9` would give `\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 10`, which is the same but `y = 9` is not `x // 2`.

To properly solve the problem, we need to find a `y` that maximizes the expression `\gcd(x, y) + y`. A better approach would be to check values of `y` starting from `x - 1` down to `1` and find the maximum value of `\gcd(x, y) + y`.

Given the current implementation, it does not guarantee finding the maximum value of `\gcd(x, y) + y`. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
