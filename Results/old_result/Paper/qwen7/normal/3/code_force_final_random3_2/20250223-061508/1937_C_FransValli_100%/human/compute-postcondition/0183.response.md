Output State: **`res` is the new input string from the user, `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, `i` must be between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, and `arr` is a list containing only one element which is 0.**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `res`. The values of `maxi`, `i`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial state.
