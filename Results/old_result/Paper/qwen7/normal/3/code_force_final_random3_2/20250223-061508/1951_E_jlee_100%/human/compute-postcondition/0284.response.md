Postcondition: `j` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, and the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`; `done` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is equal to `j`, and `count` is greater than 0. The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is either greater than or equal to `count` (if the if part is executed). If the if part is not executed, `count2` is equal to `1`.
