You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n + 1`; `x` will be 1 if `a[i]` (which is `a[n + 1]`) is greater than 1, else 2; `b[i]` (which is `b[n + 1]`) will be the sum of all `x` values from `b[0]` to `b[n]`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be `n + 1`, `x` will depend on whether `a[n + 1]` is greater than 1, and `b[n + 1]` will be the cumulative sum of `x` values calculated during each iteration of the loop.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: [a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[n]]
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: `q` must be equal to the total number of iterations the loop will run, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the output is either 'NO' or 'YES' depending on the condition a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list `c` of n positive integers and handles q queries. For each query, it checks a range [l_i, r_i] within the list and returns the sum of elements within that range.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
