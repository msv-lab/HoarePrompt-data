Output State: **max_sum is 3, x is 0, y is 1, gcd_val is 1, current_sum is 2, best_y is 1, and results contain 1.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `x` will be decremented to 0 because it starts as 1 less than the length of `test_cases` (which remains constant), and the loop runs until `x` is greater than 0. The variable `y` will be set to 1 at the end of the last iteration since the loop decrements `y` from `x-1` to 1. The `gcd_val` will be 1 because the GCD of any number with 1 is 1. `current_sum` will be 2 because when `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is 1, so `current_sum` is `1 + 1`. `max_sum` remains 3 as it was updated to 2 but never exceeded during the last iteration. `best_y` is set to 1 because it was updated in the last iteration when `current_sum` became 2, which is greater than the previous `max_sum` of 1. The `results` list remains unchanged as no operation modifies it within the loop.
