The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `arr`, a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n. After processing the input, the function returns `max_beauty`, which is the sum of the absolute differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to n-1.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers, and returns the maximum beauty which is the sum of the absolute differences between each consecutive pair of elements in the sorted list `new_arr` from index 1 to n-1.**
