Postcondition: `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `y` is an integer, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `y` is the third integer input, `len(a)` must be at least 1, and `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even.
