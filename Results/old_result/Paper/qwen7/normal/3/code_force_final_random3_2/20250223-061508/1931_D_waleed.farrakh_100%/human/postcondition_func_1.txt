The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `t`, followed by `t` sets of integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `arr`. It then processes these test cases using `func_1`, which is not defined in this snippet, and prints the results returned by `func_1`. The function ensures that all input constraints are respected and organizes the test cases into a structured format before passing them to `func_1`. After processing, the function outputs the results of `func_1` for each test case.
