Output State: **`same` is 2, `num` is `ar[0]`, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is infinity, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The value of `same` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
