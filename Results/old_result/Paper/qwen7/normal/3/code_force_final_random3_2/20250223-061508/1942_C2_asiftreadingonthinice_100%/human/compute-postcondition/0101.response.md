Postcondition: `tmp` is a list, `y` is an integer, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `ii` is `ii + 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `y` is the third integer input, `len(a)` must be at least 1, and `i` is either 3 or 2. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `i` is 2 and `ans` is `x + y - 1`. Otherwise, `i` is 3 and `tmp` has an additional element which is `((a[2] - a[1]) // 2)`.
