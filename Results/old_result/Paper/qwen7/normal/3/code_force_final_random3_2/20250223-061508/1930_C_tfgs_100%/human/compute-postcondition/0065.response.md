Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 3, `adv` is `min(a[1] - a[2] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `ans` contains `a[1] - 3`, `ans` contains `a[2] - 3`, `ans` contains `a[1] - 4`, `ans` now also contains `a[1] - 4 - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, `cur` is `cur - adv`, `ans` now also contains `a[2]`**.

Explanation: The code `ans.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 2, `ans` now includes the value of `a[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
