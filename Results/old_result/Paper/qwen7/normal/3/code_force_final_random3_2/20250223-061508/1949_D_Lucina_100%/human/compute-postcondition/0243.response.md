Postcondition: `xx` is a 2D list, `i` and `j` are indices within `xx`, and `nx` is either 'F' or 'S'. If `i` or `j + 1` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'. Additionally, if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` is increased by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `nx` remains unchanged based on the condition of `i` or `j + 1` being in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`.
