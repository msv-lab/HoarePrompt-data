Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases. The initial values of `n`, `x`, and `y` for each test case are yet to be inputted, and the lists of x distinct integers from 1 to n are also yet to be inputted.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(tt):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = x + y - 2
    tmp = []
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
            tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
    if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)
    tmp.sort()
    for i in tmp:
        if y >= i - 1:
            ans += i
            y -= i - 1
        else:
            break
    ans += y
    print(min(ans, n - 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tmp` is an empty list, `y` is an integer, `ans` is the final accumulated value of `ans + y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is the final value of `ans` after all iterations, `y` is the remaining value after all possible subtractions, and all elements in `tmp` have been iterated over.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is the sum of all `i` values where `y` was greater than or equal to `i - 1` plus the current value of `y`, and `y` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
