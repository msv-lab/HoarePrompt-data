You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `a[i]` for each valid index `i` will be the original value of `a[i]` plus the sum of `(i + 1)` for each iteration `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
    #
    #In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations, each element `a[i]` (where `0 ≤ i < n`) will have been incremented by `i + 1` for every `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, the final value of `a[i]` will be the initial value of `a[i]` plus the sum of the series `(1 + 2 + ... + n)`, which is `n * (n + 1) / 2`. 
    #
    #So, the output state can be described as: Each element in the list `a` is incremented by the sum of the first `n` natural numbers starting from 1.
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
        cur += counter[a[i]]
        
    #State: All elements in the list `a` are appended to `ans`, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, and `ans` contains all the calculated values based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute `cnt` times, which is 1 time based on the given information. After the loop executes, `ans` is a list where each element is one less than the previous element, starting from the initial state where `ans` contains all elements from the list `a`. The last element of `ans` will be `a[0] - cnt`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `ans` will be a list where each element is reduced by 1 for every iteration of the loop, starting from the original elements of list `a`. Since the loop runs only once (`cnt` is 1), each element in `ans` will be exactly 1 less than its corresponding element in the original list `a`.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: a0-1 a1-1 a2-1 ... an-1-1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of integers `a` for each test case defined by an integer `t`. For each test case, `t` represents the number of test cases, `n` is the size of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers. The function returns a result based on the processing of these lists and integers, though the specific processing and return value are not detailed here.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
