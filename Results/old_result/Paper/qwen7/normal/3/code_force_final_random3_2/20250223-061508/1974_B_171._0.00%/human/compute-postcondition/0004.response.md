Output State: **`decoded` is now ['mapping[char]'], `mapping` remains an empty dictionary, `encoded` remains unchanged, and the current value of `char` is no longer in the `mapping` dictionary.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `mapping[char]` to the `decoded` list. Since `decoded` was initially an empty list, after appending `mapping[char]`, it becomes a list containing one element, which is the value of `mapping[char]`. The `mapping` dictionary and the `encoded` string remain unchanged. Additionally, since `char` was present in the `mapping` dictionary before the append operation, it is no longer in the dictionary afterward.
