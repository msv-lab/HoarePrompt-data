Postcondition: `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers. If the difference between the first two elements of `a` is 2, then `ans` is set to 1. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even (but not necessarily 2), then `tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. There is no additional change to the list `a` or the variable `i` in the else part.
