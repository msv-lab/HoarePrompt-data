Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
2. The solution provided attempts to solve this by simply printing \(x - 2\) for each test case.
3. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the number of triangles that can be formed from \(x\) chosen vertices in a polygon is indeed \(x - 2\).
4. This is because, in a polygon, any set of \(x\) vertices can form at most \(x - 2\) triangles without any intersections, as each triangle uses 3 vertices and each additional triangle shares at least one vertex with the previous ones.

Given the above points, the provided solution is correct as it follows the mathematical principle correctly.

Correctness: **True**
