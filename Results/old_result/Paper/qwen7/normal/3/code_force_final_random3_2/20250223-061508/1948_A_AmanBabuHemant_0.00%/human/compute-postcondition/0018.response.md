Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is an integer. If `n` is odd, `n` remains unchanged. If `n` is even, `n` is treated as an even integer, and `s` is set to '110' repeated `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, `s` remains as calculated. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, `s` is adjusted to have exactly 200 characters.
