Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 3\) and higher values of \(n\). 

For \(n = 3\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
2 3
```
However, the optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) should include three cells such that the Manhattan distances are maximized. A better arrangement would be:
```
1 1
2 1
3 1
```
This arrangement gives the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\), which has a size of 3. The program only outputs two cells, resulting in a smaller set of distances.

For \(n > 3\), the program's approach also fails to maximize the set of Manhattan distances. For example, for \(n = 4\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
2 4
4 4
```
A better arrangement for \(n = 4\) would be:
```
1 1
2 1
3 1
4 1
```
This arrangement gives the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4. The program's output does not achieve this maximum size.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\).
