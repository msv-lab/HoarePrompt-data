Output State: **`prev` is now equal to `curr`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `tree` is a list containing `s` and `curr`, `curr` is `nodes[s][0]`, `curr` is not equal to `e`, and the current value of `nodes[curr][1]` is equal to the previous value of `prev`.**

Explanation: The code `curr = nodes[curr][1]` updates the value of `curr` to the second element of the sublist in `nodes` that corresponds to the current value of `curr`. Since `curr` was previously equal to `nodes[curr][0]` (and is not equal to `e`), it gets updated to `nodes[curr][1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
