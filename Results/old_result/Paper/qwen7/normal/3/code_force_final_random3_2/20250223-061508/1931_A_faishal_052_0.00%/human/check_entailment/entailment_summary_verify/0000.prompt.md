You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case, it reads an integer `lex` and constructs a list `arr` based on certain conditions. It then sorts `arr` and prints the first three elements of the sorted list as characters using their corresponding ASCII values adjusted by adding 96. The function does not return any value but prints the output for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain inputs. 

For example, consider the input `24`. The correct output should be `"aav"`, but the program outputs something else. Let's break down the issue:

- The program initializes an empty list `arr` and reads the encoded value `lex`.
- It then tries to fill `arr` with the smallest possible values that fit the constraints.
- However, the logic inside the loop is flawed. It assumes that the first two characters will always be the smallest possible values (1 or 26) and the third character will be whatever remains after subtracting these values from `lex`.

Let's walk through the example `24`:
- The program starts with `lex = 24`.
- In the first iteration (`j = 0`), it checks if `lex <= 26`. Since `24 <= 26`, it appends `1` to `arr` and sets `lex = 24 - 1 = 23`.
- In the second iteration (`j = 1`), it again checks if `lex <= 26`. Since `23 <= 26`, it appends `1` to `arr` and sets `lex = 23 - 1 = 22`.
- Finally, it appends `22` to `arr` and sorts it, resulting in `arr = [1, 1, 22]`.
- Converting these values back to characters using `chr(arr[k] + 96)` results in `"aaz"` instead of `"aav"`.

To fix this, the program needs to properly handle the distribution of the encoded value across the three characters to ensure the lexicographically smallest word is generated.
