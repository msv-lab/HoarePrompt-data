Output State: **`n` must be non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than zero, `rep` must be less than 60, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**.

Explanation: The code calculates two new variables, `Min` and `Max`. `Min` is set to the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` is set to the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. The conditions for `n`, `k`, and `rep` remain unchanged.
