Output State: **`ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B', `c` is 0, `d` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables `c` and `d` to 0. The values of `ma`, `mi`, `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
