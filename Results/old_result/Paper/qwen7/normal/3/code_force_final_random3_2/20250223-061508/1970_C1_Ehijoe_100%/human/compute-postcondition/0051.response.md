Output State: **`prev` is equal to `curr`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `tree` is a list containing `s`, `curr`, and `curr` is `nodes[s][0]`, and `curr` is not equal to `e`; `prev` is now equal to `curr` appended to `tree`.**

Explanation: The line `prev = curr` updates the value of `prev` to be the same as the current value of `curr`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
