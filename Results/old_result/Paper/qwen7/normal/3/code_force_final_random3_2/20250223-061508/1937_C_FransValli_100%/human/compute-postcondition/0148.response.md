Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `item in arr[1:]`. This means the loop iterates over the elements of `arr` starting from the second element (index 1).

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mini` is equal to `arr[2]`.
   - `item` is `arr[2]`.
   - `res` is an input string.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `arr[1:]`, the next value of `item` will be the next element in `arr` after `arr[2]`. If `arr` has more than 3 elements, the next `item` will be `arr[3]`.
   - The variable `mini` will be updated if `item` is less than `mini` according to the loop body logic, but since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine if it was updated or not. However, the postcondition given does not specify any update to `mini` based on `res`, so `mini` remains unchanged unless the loop body updates it.
   - The variable `item` will be updated to the next element in `arr`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `mini` remains as `arr[2]` unless the loop body updates it, but since the postcondition does not specify any update, we assume it remains unchanged.
   - `item` will be the next element in `arr` after `arr[2]`, which is `arr[3]` if `arr` has more than 3 elements.
   - `res` remains unchanged as per the postcondition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`mini` is equal to `arr[2]`, `item` is `arr[3]`, `res` is an input string**.
