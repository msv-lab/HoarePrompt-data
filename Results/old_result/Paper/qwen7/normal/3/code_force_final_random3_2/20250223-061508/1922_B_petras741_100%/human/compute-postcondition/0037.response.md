Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variable `j` and the expression `eta_ln`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` set to 1 because the range is specified as `range(1, eta_ln)`. Therefore, `j` must be 1 at the start of the loop.

3. **Determine the Value of `eta_ln`**: Since `j` starts at 1 and the loop runs until `j < eta_ln`, `eta_ln` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute. If `eta_ln` were less than 2, the loop would not start.

4. **Other Variables**: The variables `eta`, `rho`, and `res` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be 1.
- `eta_ln` should be at least 2.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`j` is 1, `eta_ln` must be at least 2**.
