Output State: `res` is the final input string provided by the user after the loop has executed all its iterations, `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, and `i` is equal to `n`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. After each iteration, `maxi` is updated to `i` if `res` is `<`. Since the loop runs until `i` reaches `n-1`, `maxi` will be set to `n-1` once the loop completes. The value of `i` will also be `n-1` at the end of the loop. The variable `mini` and `item` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
