Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `e` is 0, `l` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers split from the input, `x` is the value of `nums[i]`, `y` is 100000000.**

In this step, the value of `x` is assigned the value of `nums[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `nums[i]` is greater than 0 is still valid.
