Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`**.

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
