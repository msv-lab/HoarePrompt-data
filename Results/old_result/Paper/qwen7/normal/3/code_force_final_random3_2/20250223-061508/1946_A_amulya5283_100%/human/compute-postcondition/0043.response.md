Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to `mdx + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `res` is 2, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, and the current value of `a[mdx + 1]` is yet to be determined.**

Explanation: The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Initially, `res` was 1, so after executing this line, `res` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
