Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x // 2`, and `x` is reassigned to an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `y = x // 2` calculates the integer division of `x` by 2 and assigns the result to `y`. However, since `x` is reassigned to an input integer after this line, the value of `y` will be based on the new value of `x`. The initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated assignment of `y` and the reassignment of `x` to an input integer, while keeping the other variables as they were initially.
