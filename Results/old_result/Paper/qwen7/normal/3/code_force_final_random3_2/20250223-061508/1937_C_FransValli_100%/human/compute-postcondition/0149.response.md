Based on the initial state provided:

- `mini` is equal to `arr[2]`. This means `mini` is the third element of the list `arr`.
- `item` is `arr[3]`. This means `item` is the fourth element of the list `arr`.
- `res` is an input string, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

This will print a string starting with a question mark (`?`), followed by the value of `mini` twice, then the value of `item` twice. Since `mini` is the third element of `arr` and `item` is the fourth element of `arr`, the output will be:

Output: **? [arr[2]] [arr[2]] [arr[3]] [arr[3]]**
