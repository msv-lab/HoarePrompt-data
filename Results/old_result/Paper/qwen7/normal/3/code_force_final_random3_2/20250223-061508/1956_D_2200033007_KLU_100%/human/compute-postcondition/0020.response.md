Output State: **`is_already_stairs` is True, `j` is equal to `i`, `i` is 0, `res` is a list containing the tuple `(0, 0)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(start_index, start_index)` to the list `res`. Given that `start_index` is equal to `i`, which is 0, the list `res` now contains the tuple `(0, 0)`. The other variables `is_already_stairs` and `j` retain their initial values since they are not affected by the code snippet.
