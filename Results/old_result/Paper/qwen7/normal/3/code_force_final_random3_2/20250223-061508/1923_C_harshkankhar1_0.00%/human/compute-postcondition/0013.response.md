Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n + 1`; `x` will be 1 if `a[i]` (which is `a[n + 1]`) is greater than 1, else 2; `b[i]` (which is `b[n + 1]`) will be the sum of all `x` values from `b[0]` to `b[n]`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be `n + 1`, `x` will depend on whether `a[n + 1]` is greater than 1, and `b[n + 1]` will be the cumulative sum of `x` values calculated during each iteration of the loop.
