Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `ans` is 0, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. It does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, while updating `ans` to 0.
