Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` which represent the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, Bodya's starting position, and Sasha's starting position, respectively.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Positions:**
   - The positions `b` and `s` are adjusted to be zero-indexed by subtracting 1 from their values.

3. **Initial Scores Calculation:**
   - The initial scores for Bodya and Sasha (`sp` and `bp`) are set to the values at their starting positions in the array `a`.
   - The maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha (`bm` and `sm`) are also initialized to the initial scores multiplied by `k`.

4. **Game Simulation:**
   - A loop runs `k` times, simulating each turn of the game.
   - In each iteration, the positions of Bodya and Sasha are updated to their new positions using the permutation `p`.
   - The scores are updated accordingly.
   - The maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha are updated to ensure they reflect the best possible outcomes after `k` turns.

5. **Determining the Winner:**
   - After the loop, the program compares the maximum possible scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, and 'Draw' if the scores are equal.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Position Adjustment:**
   - Adjusting positions to be zero-indexed is correct since the indices in the arrays start from 1.

2. **Initial Scores Calculation:**
   - The initial scores are correctly calculated based on the starting positions.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The loop correctly simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - The positions are updated correctly using the permutation `p`.
   - The scores are updated correctly based on the current positions and the values in the array `a`.

4. **Maximum Possible Scores:**
   - The maximum possible scores are updated correctly to reflect the best possible outcomes after `k` turns.

5. **Winner Determination:**
   - The logic for determining the winner is correct. It checks the maximum possible scores and prints the appropriate result.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
