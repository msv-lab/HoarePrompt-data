Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is 10^9 except `ans[i]` which is `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, `i` is now `n - 3`.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is decremented by 1. Initially, `i` was `n - 2`. After decrementing, `i` becomes `n - 3`. All other variables (`arr`, `ans`) remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
