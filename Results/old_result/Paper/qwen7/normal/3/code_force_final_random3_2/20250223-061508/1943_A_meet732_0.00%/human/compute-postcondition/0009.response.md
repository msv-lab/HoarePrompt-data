Output State: **`cntl[i]` is now 4, `i` is the third element of `a`, and `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is 0 except `cntl[i]` which is now 4.**

Explanation: The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. Since `cntl[i]` was previously 3, it is now 4. All other elements in the list `cntl` remain 0, and `i` remains the third element of `a`.
