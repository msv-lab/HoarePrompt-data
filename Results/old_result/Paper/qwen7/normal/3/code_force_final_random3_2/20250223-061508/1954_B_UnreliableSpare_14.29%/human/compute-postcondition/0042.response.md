Output State: **`ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr` plus one for any segment that does not start with `val`, and `cnt` is updated to be the new value of `ans`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and the value of `cnt`. This means `ans` is now the smallest value between its original value and the current value of `cnt`. The variable `i` is equal to `n`, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr` plus one for any segment that does not start with `val`. The variable `cnt` is updated to the new value of `ans`.
