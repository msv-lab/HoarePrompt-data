Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers t, a, and m, where t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ a, m ≤ 10^{18}. It returns a result based on these inputs.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes multiple test cases (t times) where for each test case, it takes integers a and m and performs some operation on them. However, without the specific operation details, the primary description focuses on accepting and processing these parameters.
