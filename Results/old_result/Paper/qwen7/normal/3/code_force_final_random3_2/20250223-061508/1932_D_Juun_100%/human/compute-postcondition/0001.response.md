Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string which is the input from the user, we read an input but did not assign it to any variable.**

The code assigns the input value to the variable `trump`, which was previously set to be one of "CDHS". Since the input is not assigned to any variable, the other variables (`t` and `n`) remain unchanged. The new state is that `trump` now holds the value of the input string.
