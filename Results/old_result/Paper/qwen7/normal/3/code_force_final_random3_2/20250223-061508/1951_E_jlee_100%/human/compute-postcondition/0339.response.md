Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `count + 1`
- `n` is greater than 0
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is set to `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
- If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, no changes are made to `done`.
- If `count` is equal to `j`, `done` remains unchanged and the loop continues.

The print statement is `print(2)`. This statement will simply print the number 2, regardless of the conditions described for `s`, `j`, `n`, and `done`.

Output: **2**
