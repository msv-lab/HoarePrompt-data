Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `u` is an input integer.
   - `v` is an input integer.
   - `nodes[v]` now contains `u`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Given that `i` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 1 (which is already given as `n` must be at least 2).

5. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 (which is already stated as `n` must be at least 2).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
