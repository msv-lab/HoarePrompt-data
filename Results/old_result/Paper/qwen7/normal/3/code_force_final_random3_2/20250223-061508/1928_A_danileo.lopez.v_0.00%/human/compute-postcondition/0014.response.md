Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `_` is 2, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, `a` is assigned the first integer from input, `b` is assigned the second integer from input.** 

This postcondition remains the same because both the if and else parts do not change the values of `t`, `_`, `a`, or `b`. The if and else parts do not modify these variables, so the postcondition simply reiterates the initial state of the variables as described in the precondition.
