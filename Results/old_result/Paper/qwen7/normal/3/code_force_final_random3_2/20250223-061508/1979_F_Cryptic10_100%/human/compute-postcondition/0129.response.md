Based on the initial state described:

- `ops` does not change and is not relevant to the print statement.
- `p2` starts with `['a', 'a']` and may have additional elements appended based on the loop conditions.
- `vx` remains as the set containing the last two integers originally in the set from 1 to n, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `p1[::-1]` reverses the list `p1`.
- `p1[::-1] + p2` concatenates the reversed `p1` with `p2`.
- `map(str, ...)` converts each element in the concatenated list to a string.
- `' '.join(...)` joins these strings with spaces.

Given that `p2` starts with `['a', 'a']` and may have additional elements, let's denote the elements of `p2` as `['a', 'a', v1, v2, ..., vn]` where `v1, v2, ..., vn` are the elements appended during the loop iterations.

The output will be:
```
! a a v1 v2 ... vn
```

Output: **! a a v1 v2 ... vn** (where `v1, v2, ..., vn` are the elements appended to `p2` during the loop iterations)
