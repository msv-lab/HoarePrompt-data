Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `s` is the start value of the tuple at the `min(eli, LA)` index.
- `e` is the end value of the tuple at the `min(eli, LA)` index.
- `arr` is an empty list.
- `nums` is a list with at least `N + 1` elements.
- `l` is an integer from the input split.
- `r` is an integer from the input split.
- `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`.
- The current value of `s` is less than or equal to `r`.

The `print(s - 1, s)` statement will print two values: `s - 1` and `s`.

Since `s` is the start value of the tuple at the `min(eli, LA)` index, and it is guaranteed that `s` is less than or equal to `r`, the values of `s - 1` and `s` are dependent on the actual value of `s`.

However, without knowing the specific value of `s`, we can only describe it in terms of the given conditions.

Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index)**
