### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the function `func_2` is not correctly implemented to solve the problem. However, upon closer inspection, the provided function summary for `func_2` states that the function always returns a value of 10, regardless of the input values \(n\) and \(m\). This directly contradicts the expected behavior derived from the example test cases, where the function returns the correct counts for various inputs.

Given the function summary, we can conclude that the implementation of `func_2` is indeed incorrect because it does not depend on the input values \(n\) and \(m\) and always returns a fixed value of 10. This is clearly not the intended behavior for the problem.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_2` is incorrect as it does not solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) as per the problem statement.
