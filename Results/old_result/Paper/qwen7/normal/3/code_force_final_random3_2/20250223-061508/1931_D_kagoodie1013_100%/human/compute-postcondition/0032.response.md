Output State: **`count` is 0 + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0), `results` contains the value of `count`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is calculated based on the last `num` processed, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**

In more natural language: The value of `count` is updated by adding the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` to its current value, which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged. `count` now holds the sum of its original value (0) and the value found in the `residue_map` dictionary for the key `(r_x, r_y)`, or 0 if the key does not exist.
