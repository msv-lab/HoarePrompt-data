Output State: **`h1` is '01', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'AM'**.

Explanation: The variable `time` is assigned the value `'AM'`. The values of `h1` and `m1` remain unchanged from their initial states. The initial state of `time` being an empty string is overridden by the assignment, resulting in `time` being set to `'AM'`.
