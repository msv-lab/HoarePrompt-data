Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `j` is defined as `n // 2 - 1`.
   - `x` is defined as `n // 2`.
   - `ans` is defined differently based on whether `n` is even or odd:
     - If `n` is even, `ans` is the concatenation of `'s[i]*2'` for all `i` from `0` to `n // 2 - 1`.
     - If `n` is odd and `n` is at least 3, `ans` is `'A'` multiplied by `(n // 2 - 1) * 2`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Given this analysis, the print statement will always output the string `'YES'`, regardless of the value of `n`, `j`, `x`, or `ans`.

Output: **YES**
