Output State: **`left` is 1; `right` is greater than or equal to 1; `new_arr` is a list containing `arr[0]`, `arr[right]`, and `arr[left]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `arr[left]` to `new_arr`. Given that `left` is 1, `new_arr` initially contains `arr[0]` and `arr[right]`. After appending `arr[left]`, `new_arr` now includes `arr[0]`, `arr[right]`, and `arr[1]`. The values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged.
