Given the initial state:
- `a` is an integer entered by the user.
- `b` is an integer entered by the user.
- `m` is an integer entered by the user.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `B` is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`.
- `A` is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`.

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print(A + B)` executes.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `A` is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`. This means `A` is the integer division of `m` by `a` plus 1.
2. `B` is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`. This means `B` is the integer division of `m` by `b` plus 1.
3. When the `print(A + B)` statement is executed, it will add the values of `A` and `B` together and print the result.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of `A` and `B`.

Output: **int(m / a) + int(m / b) + 2**
