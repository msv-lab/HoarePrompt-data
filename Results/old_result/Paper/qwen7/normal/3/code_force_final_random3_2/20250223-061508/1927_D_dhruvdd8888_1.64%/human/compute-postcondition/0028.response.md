Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `N + 1`, `s` is `N`, `num` is equal to `nums[N]`, `arr` contains tuples starting from (2, 0, `nums[0]`), followed by (1, 1, `nums[0]`), and ending with a tuple (1 + `s`, `N`, `nums[N]`), and `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the list `arr` and assigns it to the variable `LA`. Since `arr` contains `N + 1` elements (from the first tuple (2, 0, `nums[0]`) to the last tuple (1 + `s`, `N`, `nums[N]`)), the length of `arr` is `N + 1`. Therefore, `LA` is `N + 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `N`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
