Output State: **`p` is the length of the string `l`, which is the binary representation of the integer value of `f` without the '0b' prefix; `q` is 2 ** (p - 1)**.

Explanation: The code `q = 2 ** (p - 1)` calculates the value of `q` based on the value of `p`. Since `p` is the length of the binary representation of `f` (without the '0b' prefix), `q` is set to \(2^{(p-1)}\). The values of `p` and `f` remain unchanged, and the new value of `q` is calculated based on `p`.
