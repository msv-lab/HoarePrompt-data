Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The key variables here are `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `idx` is increased by `3 * n + 1`.
   - `results` is a list to which the return value of `func_1(n, a)` has been appended.
   - `n` is an integer obtained from `data[idx]`.
   - `a` is updated to be the map of integers from the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and of length `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since it was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will still be greater than 0 unless explicitly modified within the loop body (which is omitted).
   - `idx` will be increased by `3 * n + 1` again.
   - `results` will be updated by appending the return value of `func_1(n, a)` to the list.
   - `n` will be updated to the value of `data[idx]` again.
   - `a` will be updated to be the map of integers from the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and of length `n` again.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the necessary adjustments:

- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `idx` is increased by `3 * n + 1`.
- `results` is updated by appending the return value of `func_1(n, a)`.
- `n` is updated to the value of `data[idx]`.
- `a` is updated to be the map of integers from the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and of length `n`.

However, since we are only asked to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we focus on `t`:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by 3 * n + 1, `results` is a list to which the return value of `func_1(n, a)` has been appended, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[idx]`, and `a` is updated to be the map of integers from the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and of length `n`**.

Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment for the loop to continue, the final state is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.
