Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of stone piles. The key points are:
   - Alice and Bob take turns removing a number of stones equal to the smallest non-empty pile from all non-empty piles.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If the smallest pile has 1 stone, the player whose turn it is can always reduce all piles to zero in one move and win.
   - If the smallest pile has more than 1 stone, the game can be analyzed further based on the differences between consecutive piles.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to determine the winner based on specific conditions:
     - If the smallest pile has 1 stone (`set_[0] == 1`), Alice wins immediately.
     - Otherwise, it checks if the differences between consecutive piles are exactly 1. This is done using a loop that iterates through the sorted unique values of the piles.
     - The boolean variable `A` alternates between `True` and `False` based on the parity of the number of piles with a difference of 1 between them.
     - Finally, it returns 'Alice' if the condition matches the current state of `A`, otherwise 'Bob'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the smallest pile has 1 stone.
   - The logic for checking the differences between consecutive piles seems to be correct and aligns with the problem statement.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic of the function appears to be consistent with the problem requirements. It correctly identifies the winning condition based on the initial configuration of the piles.

Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
