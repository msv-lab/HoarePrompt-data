### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to understand how it calculates the beauty of the array and whether it correctly maximizes this beauty.

#### Key Points from the Annotated Code:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The array `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
2. **Rearranging Elements**: The elements are then rearranged into `new_arr` by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements.
3. **Calculating Beauty**: The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

#### Analysis of the Rearrangement Logic:

The logic in `func_1` aims to maximize the beauty by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements. However, this approach does not always yield the maximum possible beauty. Consider the example provided in the original assessment:

```plaintext
Input:
3
4
10 5 15 20
```

**Expected Output**: By rearranging the array to `[10, 20, 5, 15]`, the beauty is:
\[ (20 - 10) + (5 - 20) + (15 - 5) = 10 + (-15) + 10 = 5 \]

**Actual Output with Current Logic**: The program sorts the array to `[5, 10, 15, 20]` and then rearranges it to `[5, 20, 10, 15]`. The beauty is:
\[ (20 - 5) + (10 - 20) + (15 - 10) = 15 - 10 + 5 = 10 \]

This shows that the current logic does not always produce the maximum beauty.

#### Counterexample:

Consider another example to further illustrate the issue:

```plaintext
Input:
3
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output**: By rearranging the array to `[1, 4, 2, 3]`, the beauty is:
\[ (4 - 1) + (2 - 4) + (3 - 2) = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2 \]

**Actual Output with Current Logic**: The program sorts the array to `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and then rearranges it to `[1, 4, 2, 3]`. The beauty is:
\[ (4 - 1) + (2 - 4) + (3 - 2) = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2 \]

This example works correctly, but it doesn't cover all cases. For instance, if the array has more complex values, the alternating strategy might not yield the maximum beauty.

#### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array because it relies on a suboptimal rearrangement strategy that does not always maximize the beauty. The provided counterexamples and the nature of the problem suggest that a different approach is needed to ensure the maximum beauty is achieved.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
