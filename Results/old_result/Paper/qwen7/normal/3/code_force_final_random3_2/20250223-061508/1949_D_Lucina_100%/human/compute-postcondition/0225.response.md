Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for loop execution**: The loop `for j in range(1, n + 1):` will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1 (since the range starts from 1).
3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means `n` must be at least 1.

Given the initial states:
- `total` is 0
- `i` is 6
- `nx` is ''
- `j` is 7
- `n` is 4

We need to adjust the state of `n` to ensure the loop can execute. Since `n` is currently 4, which is greater than 1, no adjustment is needed for `n`.

However, we should also note the value of `j` in the loop. Initially, `j` is 7, but the loop starts with `j` being 1. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to 1.

So, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` to 1 and `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**State:**
**`total` is 0, `i` is 6, `nx` is '', `j` is 1, `n` is 4**
