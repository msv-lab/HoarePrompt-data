Output: **n // 2 * b + a (where n, a, and b are the first, second, and third integer inputs respectively, and `//` denotes integer division)**

Explanation:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), but this value is not used in the print statement.
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `a` is the second integer input.
- `b` is the third integer input.
- The expression `n // 2 * b + a` calculates:
  - `n // 2`: Integer division of `n` by 2, which means it divides `n` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
  - `n // 2 * b`: Multiplies the result of the integer division by `b`.
  - `n // 2 * b + a`: Adds `a` to the result of the previous multiplication.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of the expression `n // 2 * b + a`, where `n`, `a`, and `b` are the values of the first, second, and third integer inputs, respectively.
