Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input from the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found.**

This means that the variable `x` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of the character '1' within the string `arr`. If '1' is not found in `arr`, `x` will be set to -1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
