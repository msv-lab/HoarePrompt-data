Output: **NONE**

Explanation: The initial state provides the following information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) and \(t \geq 2\). This means `t` is any integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are the first, second, and third integers from the input respectively.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NONE'`. Since no other operations are performed on the variables `a`, `b`, or `c`, their values are not used in the print statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'NONE'`.
