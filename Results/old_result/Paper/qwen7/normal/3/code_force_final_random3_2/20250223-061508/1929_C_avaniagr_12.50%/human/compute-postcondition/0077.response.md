Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is set to `t - 1`, but since no specific value for `t` is given initially, we can only say that `t` is one less than its original value.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
