Output State: **`suits` is an empty dictionary, `trumps` is a sorted list of the original trump values, and `answers` is a list containing strings formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump' for each iteration executed.**

Explanation: The line `trumps = sorted(trumps)` sorts the list `trumps` in ascending order. The other variables (`suits` and `answers`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
