Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to perform a series of operations on the array `a` and then construct a new array `b` from the set `S` in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order of `b`.

2. **Operations**:
   - We need to ensure that each element `a_i` is processed exactly once.
   - For each element `a_i`, we insert `a_i + i` into the set `S` and then remove `a_i` from `a`.
   - After processing all elements, we sort the set `S` in descending order to form the array `b`.

3. **Key Insight**:
   - To maximize the lexicographical order of `b`, we should aim to have the largest possible values in `b`. This means we should try to maximize the values inserted into `S`.
   - The key observation is that the value `a_i + i` is unique for each `i` because `a_i` is unique and `i` is unique within the range `[1, n]`.

4. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The provided code correctly processes each element of `a` and inserts `a_i + i` into the set `S`.
   - It then sorts the set `S` in descending order to form the array `b`.
   - The logic to reduce the elements in `ans` by 1 for the remaining count `cnt` ensures that the final array `b` is constructed correctly.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where there might be duplicate elements in `a` by using a `Counter` to keep track of the counts.
   - The sorting and reduction steps ensure that the final array `b` is constructed correctly even when there are duplicates.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the required operations and constructs the lexicographically largest array `b`.

Correctness: **True**
