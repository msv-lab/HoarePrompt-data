Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial values**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 5 and `n` is 4.
3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`. Since `n` is 4, the loop will run for `j = 1, 2, 3, 4`.

Given that `j` is currently 5, it means the loop has already completed its iterations (since `j` starts from 1 and goes up to 4). Therefore, there is no next iteration of the loop to consider.

However, if we were to consider the next hypothetical iteration where `j` would be 6 (which is beyond the loop's range), we would need to adjust the state accordingly.

Since the loop has already completed, the state does not change for the next iteration. But let's assume hypothetically what the state would be if the loop were to continue:

- `j` would be incremented to 6.
- `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration (hypothetically) would be:

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 5, `nx` is either 'F' or 'S', `j` is 6, and `n` is 4**.
