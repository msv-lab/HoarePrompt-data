Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `j` and `n + r + 1`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the values are:
   - `j` is 2
   - `n` is the input integer
   - `r` is 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 1 to `n + r + 1`. Given that `r` is currently 0, the loop runs for `j` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

4. **Calculate the next value of `j`**: Since `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2. Therefore, in the next iteration, `j` will be 3.

5. **Check if the loop can continue**: For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`. Since `j` is now 3, the loop will continue if `n + 1` is greater than or equal to 3. This means `n` must be at least 2 (since `n + 1 >= 3` implies `n >= 2`).

6. **Adjust the state**: The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n + r + 1`. Since `r` remains 0, the upper limit of the loop is `n + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `j` is 3
- `n` is the input integer (and must be at least 2)

The final state is:
State: **`j` is 3, `n` is the input integer (and must be at least 2)**
