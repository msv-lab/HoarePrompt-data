### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. This is evident from the loop `for i in range(kreker)` where `kreker` is set to `int(input())`.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case. It correctly reads two integers `n` and `m` for each test case using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Condition Check**: The condition `if ((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0)` checks whether the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative. This is the correct logic to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves. 

   - If `n - m` is even and non-negative, it means that the number of additions and removals can balance out to result in `m` cubes.
   - If `n - m` is odd or negative, it means it's impossible to achieve `m` cubes with the given operations.

4. **Output**: The program prints 'Yes' if the condition is met and 'No' otherwise, which aligns with the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all edge cases within the specified ranges (1 ≤ t ≤ 100, 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program logic is sound and matches the problem requirements.
