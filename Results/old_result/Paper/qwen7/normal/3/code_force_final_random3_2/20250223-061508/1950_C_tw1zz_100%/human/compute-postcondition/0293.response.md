Based on the initial state provided:

- `h1` is either '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '13', or '14'.
- `m1` is equal to `m`.
- `h` and `m` are updated to the input values split by ':'.
- `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.

The `print` statement is:

```python
print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `h1` is a specific hour value from the list provided.
2. `m1` is equal to `m`, which means `m1` is the minute part of the time input.
3. `h` and `m` are the hour and minute parts of the time input, respectively, split by ':'.
4. `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.

Given these details, the `print` statement will concatenate `h1`, `:`, `m`, a space, and `time` with no additional separators due to the `sep=''` argument.

Therefore, the output will be a string in the format `h1 : m time`.

Output: **h1 : m time**
