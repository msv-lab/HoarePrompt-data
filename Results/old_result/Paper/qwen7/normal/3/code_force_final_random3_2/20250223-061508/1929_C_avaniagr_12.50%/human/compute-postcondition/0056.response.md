Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(x + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < x + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `x` must be a non-negative integer
   - `z` is `z // (k - 1) + 1`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must still be less than `x + 1`. Given that `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, `x` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `x` must remain a non-negative integer, but it must be at least 1 for the loop to continue.
   - The value of `z` does not change within the loop head and is not affected by the loop itself, so it remains `z // (k - 1) + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be at least 1, `z` is `z // (k - 1) + 1`**
