### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(n, a)` aims to calculate the maximum number of points you can get by optimally playing your cards.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`.
   - It calculates the number of pairs (integers that appear exactly twice) and returns the minimum of this number and `n // 2`.
   - This logic is correct because:
     - Each pair of identical cards can contribute to a point if played optimally.
     - Since Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours, she will always try to block your points by playing the same card if possible.
     - Therefore, the maximum number of points you can get is limited by the number of pairs and half the number of cards you have (since you can only play one card per turn and Nene will block one of them).

2. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2()` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1(n, a)` for each test case.
   - It correctly parses the input and processes each test case by calling `func_1(n, a)` and appending the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results.
   - The logic for parsing and processing the input is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input as specified and processes each test case appropriately.
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get by playing your cards optimally.
   - The overall structure and logic of the program are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

### Correctness:
