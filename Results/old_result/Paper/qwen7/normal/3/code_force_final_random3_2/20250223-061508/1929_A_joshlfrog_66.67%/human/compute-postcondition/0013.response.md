Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `e` is 0, `l` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers split from the input, `x` is the value of `nums[i]`, and `y` is the value of `nums[i]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `y`. Since `nums[i]` is less than 100000000, `y` now holds the same value as `nums[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
