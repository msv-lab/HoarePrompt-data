Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `possible` retains its original value, strings `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, strings `b` and `c` are the input strings stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().strip()` takes an input string, strips it of any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `a`. The values of `i`, `n`, `possible`, `b`, `c`, and `t` remain unchanged.
