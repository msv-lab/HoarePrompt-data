Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `answer` has an element appended from `array[a[-1]]`, `a[-1]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of list `a` by 1. Since `i` and `n` are not affected by this operation, their states remain the same. The `answer` list has an element appended from `array[a[-1]]`, which means the last element of `a` was used to index into `array`. After decrementing `a[-1]` by 1, the new value of `a[-1]` is used to append an element to `answer`.
