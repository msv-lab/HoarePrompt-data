Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1 and the element at index `ps` - 1 set to 1; `t`, `MOD`, `alpha`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, and `paths` remain unchanged; `paths` now contains the element `a[ps - 1]` added to it.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[ps - 1]` to the list `paths`. Since `ps` is already defined, `a[ps - 1]` refers to a specific element in the list `a`. This element is added to the list `paths`, which was previously unchanged. All other variables remain in their initial state.
