Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` is `True`
- `i` is `1`
- `string` is an input string
- `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string
- `n` is `1`
- `x` is the first character of the input string
- `count` is `1`
- `count2` is either `0` or `1`
- `j` is `1`
- The first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of `s`

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print('YES')` executes.

Let's break down the relevant parts:
- `s` is a list with one element, which is the first character of the input string.
- The condition `s[j] is not equal to x` does not apply because `j` is `1` and the first element of `s` is `x`.
- Since the condition `count < 1` is not met (as `count` is `1`), the `count` assignment inside the if-statement will not change the value of `count`.

Given this, the print statement `print('YES')` will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
