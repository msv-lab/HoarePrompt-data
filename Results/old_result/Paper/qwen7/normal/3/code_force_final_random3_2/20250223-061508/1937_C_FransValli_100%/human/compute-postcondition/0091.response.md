Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `res` is the input string, and if the current value of `res` is equal to '<', then `maxi` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `res`. The initial conditions for `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition for `maxi` also remains unchanged unless the value of `res` is specifically '<'. Since the value of `res` is now the input from the user, it is represented as "the input string" in the output state.
