Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on the binary string 'a' of length n, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, consisting only of '0' and '1'.**

This means the function `func_2` does not take any input parameters but works with a predefined string `a` that meets specific criteria (length and composition) and returns a value derived from analyzing this string.
