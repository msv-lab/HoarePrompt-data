Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new string input from the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` (considering the reversed string), `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`, `n` is updated to an input integer, `x` is assigned the value of `arr.find('1')`**.

This means that the variable `x` is now set to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the string `arr`. If '1' is not found, `x` remains -1. All other variables retain their previous states.
