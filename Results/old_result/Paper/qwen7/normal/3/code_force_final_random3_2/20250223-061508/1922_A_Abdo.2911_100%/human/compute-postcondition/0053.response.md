Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0.
- After the loop, the value of `possible` is determined to be either `True` or `False` depending on whether it was ever set to `True` within the loop.
- The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` up to index `i-1` reflect the conditions checked within the loop, while the elements from index `i` onwards will not be checked and thus their original values in `a`, `b`, and `c` will remain unchanged.
- The current value of `possible` is the same as its value after the loop.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
