Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `i` (where `i` is the last divisor of `x` that satisfied the condition `n <= i`), and `i` is incremented to `i + 1` where `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration and `i + 1 <= isqrt(x)`**.

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and the current value of `i`, where `i` is a divisor of `x` and satisfies the condition `n <= i`. The variable `i` is then incremented by 1, but only up to the square root of `x`. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
