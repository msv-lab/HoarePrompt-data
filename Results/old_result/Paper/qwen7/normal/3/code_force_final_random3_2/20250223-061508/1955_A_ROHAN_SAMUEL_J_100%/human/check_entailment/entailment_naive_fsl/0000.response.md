Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where it is more advantageous to buy some yogurts at the regular price and some at the promotion price. Specifically, when `n` is odd and `2*a >= b`, the program will incorrectly calculate the cost. For example, consider the case where `n=3`, `a=5`, and `b=11`. According to the problem description, the optimal strategy is to buy one yogurt at the regular price and two yogurts at the promotion price, which would cost `5 + 11 = 16` burles. However, the program will output `15` burles, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
