Output State: `arr` is a list containing sorted elements starting with 1s followed by 26s, and ends with the value of `lex`, `k` is 2, `lex` is an integer.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `k` will be 2, as the loop iterates three times and `k` ranges from 0 to 2. The list `arr` will contain elements that are initially set to 1s and 26s based on the conditions within the loop, and it will end with the final value of `lex`. The elements in `arr` are sorted, and the loop does not modify `lex` or `k` outside of its range. Therefore, the final state of `arr` will be a sorted list starting with 1s followed by 26s, and ending with the value of `lex`.
