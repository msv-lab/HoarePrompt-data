Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, and `arr` contains a tuple (2, 0, num)**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to the list `arr`. Given that `s` is not defined in the provided context, we assume `s` to be `1` (as it is commonly used in such contexts when not specified). Since `i` is `0` and `num` is not equal to `nums[i]`, the tuple added to `arr` is `(2, 0, num)`. The values of `N` and `nums[i]` remain unchanged.
