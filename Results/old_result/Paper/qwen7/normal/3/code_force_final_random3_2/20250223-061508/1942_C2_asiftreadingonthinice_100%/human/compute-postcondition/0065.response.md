Output State: **`tmp` is a non-empty list with length `len(tmp) - 1`, `y` is an integer, `i` is the next element in `tmp`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify the values of `tmp`, `y`, or `i`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was inside. Therefore, the lengths and values of `tmp` and `i` remain unchanged, and `y` remains an integer.
