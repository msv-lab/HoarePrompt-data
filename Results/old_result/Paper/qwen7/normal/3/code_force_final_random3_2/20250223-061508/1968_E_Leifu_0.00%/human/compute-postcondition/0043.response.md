Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial values and conditions**:
   - `t` must be greater than 2 (this variable is not in the loop head).
   - `i` is 2 (this variable is not in the loop head).
   - `n` is an input integer (this variable is in the loop head).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 4 to `n + 1`.

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
- `n` must be at least 4 because the loop starts from 4 and goes up to `n + 1`.

So, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be at least 4.

**State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 4**
