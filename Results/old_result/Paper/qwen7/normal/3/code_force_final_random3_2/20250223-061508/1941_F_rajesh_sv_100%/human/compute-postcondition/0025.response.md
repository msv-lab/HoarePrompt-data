Output State: **`i` is 5, `diff` is `A[5] - A[4]`, `max_diff` is `diff`, `next_max_diff` is `max_diff`, `index` is 5, `n` must be greater than 4**.

Explanation: The code `index = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 5) to the variable `index`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `index` is updated to 5, while `i`, `diff`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and the condition on `n` remain the same.
