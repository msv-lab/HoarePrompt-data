Output State: **`i` is 3; `tmp` contains an element which is `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`; `len(a)` is greater than 1**

Explanation: The code appends to `tmp` a tuple containing half the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. Given `i` is initially 2, after executing the line of code, `i` is incremented to 3. The value of `tmp` now includes the calculated value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`. The condition `len(a) > 1` remains true as it was part of the initial state and was not affected by the code execution.
