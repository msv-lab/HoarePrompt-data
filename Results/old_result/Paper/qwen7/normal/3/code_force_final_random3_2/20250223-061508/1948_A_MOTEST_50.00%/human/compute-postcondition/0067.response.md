Output State: **`ans` is increased by `s[x] * 2`, `x` is `x + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `j` is less than `n // 2 - 1`**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` increases the value of `ans` by `s[x] * 2`. It also increments `x` by 1. The conditions for `n` and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
