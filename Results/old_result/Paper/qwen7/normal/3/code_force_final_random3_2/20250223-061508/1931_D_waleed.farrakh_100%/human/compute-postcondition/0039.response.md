Postcondition: `a` is now the next element in `arr`; `current_pair` is \((a \% x, a \% y)\); `rx` is \((-a \% x + x) \% x\); `ry` is now \(a \% y\); `count` is increased by `freq[(rx, ry)]` if \((rx, ry)\) is in `freq`. Otherwise, `count` is increased by 1; `freq[current_pair]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1.
