Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4.
- `answers` is a list containing at least one of the strings 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw'.
- `j` is the second element of the `answers` list.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(j)
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. `answers` is a list containing at least one of the strings 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw'.
2. Since `j` is defined as the second element of the `answers` list, it must be one of these strings ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw').
3. The `print` statement will output the value of `j`.

Therefore, the output will be one of the strings 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw'.

Output: **'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw'**
