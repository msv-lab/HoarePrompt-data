Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `a[3]` is 0, `b[3]` is 0, `sa` is [1, 2, 3], `sb` is a list containing the numbers from 1 to `n`, and the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.** 

This postcondition remains the same as the precondition because the if part and the else part do not change the values of the variables mentioned in the precondition. The if condition simply checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, but since the else part is empty (or not provided), the postcondition does not change from the precondition.
