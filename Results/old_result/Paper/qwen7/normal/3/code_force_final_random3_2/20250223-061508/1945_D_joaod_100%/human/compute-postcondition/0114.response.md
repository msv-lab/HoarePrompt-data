Output State: **All iterations of the loop have executed.**

In the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, the following conditions hold:

- `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `custo_pra_passar_b` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `best` is set to the minimum cumulative cost considering either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` based on which is smaller, after evaluating all possible values of `v` from `na_frente` down to 0.
- `cases` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `pos_final` is an input integer decreased by 2, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `c` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v <= pos_final` and `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` during the last iteration, otherwise `c` is 0.
- `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, and it is decreased by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0.
- `total` is the cumulative cost calculated by adding either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total` based on which is smaller, for all values of `v` from `na_frente` down to 0.
