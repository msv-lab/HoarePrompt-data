Output State: The loop will execute exactly `N + 1` times, where `N` is the integer input from stdin. After all iterations, `i` will be `N`, `s` will be equal to `N`, and `arr` will contain `N + 1` tuples. Each tuple in `arr` will have the form `(i, j, num)`, where `j` ranges from `0` to `N`. The value of `num` will be the last element of `nums` (i.e., `nums[N]`), as `num` gets updated to `nums[i]` on each iteration of the loop.

In summary, `i` will be `N`, `s` will be `N`, and `arr` will contain `N + 1` tuples of the form `(j, j, nums[j])` for `j` ranging from `0` to `N`.
