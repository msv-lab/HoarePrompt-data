Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is decreased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code, the only effect is that the execution will exit the current context where the `break` statement is placed. The values of `n`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states, except for the fact that the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
