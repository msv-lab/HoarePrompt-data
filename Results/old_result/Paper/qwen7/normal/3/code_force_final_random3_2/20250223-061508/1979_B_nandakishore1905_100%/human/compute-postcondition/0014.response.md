Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `k` is not a power of 2, and `k` is even; `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `f` is `k - q`.**

Explanation: The code `f = k - q` assigns the value of `k - q` to `f`. Here, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), where `p` is the length of the binary string representation of `k`. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged.
