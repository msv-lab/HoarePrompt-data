Postcondition: `x` is a list of characters, `j` is previous_j + 2, `b[j]` is incremented by 1, and `n` is such that previous_j + 2 <= n. If the character at `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1. If the character at `x[j - 1]` is neither 'F' nor 'S', no changes occur to `a[j]` and `b[j]`.
