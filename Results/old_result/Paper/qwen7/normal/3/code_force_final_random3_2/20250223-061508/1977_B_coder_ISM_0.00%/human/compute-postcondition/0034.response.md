Output State: **`i` is 0; `flag` is 0; `s[0]` is '-1'; `s[0]` is no longer equal to `s[1]`; `flag` is set to 0.**

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '-1'` changes the value of `s[0]` from `'1'` to `'-1'`. Since `i` is 0, this directly modifies `s[0]`. The condition `s[0] is equal to s[1]` is no longer true because `s[0]` is now `'-1'` and `s[1]` is still `'1'`. The values of `i` and `flag` remain unchanged, so they stay as 0 and 0 respectively.
