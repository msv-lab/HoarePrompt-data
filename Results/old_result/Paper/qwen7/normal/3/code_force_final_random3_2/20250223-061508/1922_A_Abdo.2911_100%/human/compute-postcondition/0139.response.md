Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n-1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise `possible` remains `False`.
   - `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace.
   - `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace.
   - `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n-1`, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to `n` (which would make `i` equal to `n`).
   - However, since `i` is already `n-1`, incrementing it would make it `n`, and the condition `i < n` would no longer be true, thus ending the loop.
   - Therefore, the only way to allow the loop to continue is to increase `n` by 1, making the new condition `i < n` true again.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` remains `n-1` because the loop will not execute again due to the current value of `i`.
   - `n` must be increased by 1 to allow the loop to continue.
   - `possible` remains unchanged unless the loop body changes its value, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume `possible` remains `True` if `c[n-1]` meets the condition, otherwise `False`.
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `t` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `possible` is `True` if `c[n-1]` is not equal to `a[n-1]` or `c[n-1]` equals `b[n-1]`, otherwise `possible` remains `False`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0.**
