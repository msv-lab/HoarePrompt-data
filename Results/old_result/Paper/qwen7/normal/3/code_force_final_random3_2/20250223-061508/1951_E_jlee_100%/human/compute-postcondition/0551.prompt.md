Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `done` remains `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list representation of the input string, `x` is the first element of the list `s`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `done` remains `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list representation of the input string, `x` is the first element of the list `s`, `count` is `j` (where `j` is the index checked in the if condition) and its current value is greater than `0`, `count2` is either `0` or `1`, `n` must be greater than `0`, and if at any point `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to `True`. If `count2 < count` and `count > 0`, `done` is set to `True` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, if `count2 == count` and `count > 1`, `done` is set to `True` and the loop breaks. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` becomes `True`. If none of these conditions are met, the loop continues with the same conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `done` is `True` if the character at index `j` in the list `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` and `count` is less than 1; otherwise, `done` is `False` and `count` is equal to `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `done` is `True` and either `count` is greater than 1, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `count` is equal to `j`, `count2` is either 0 or `count2 + 1`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is `True` and `count` remains unchanged, continuing the loop or iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
