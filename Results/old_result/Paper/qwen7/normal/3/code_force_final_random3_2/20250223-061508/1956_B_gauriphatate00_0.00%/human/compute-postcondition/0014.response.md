Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by 2 * n + 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data[idx - n:idx]`, `results` is a list to which the return value of `func_1(n, a)` has been appended, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[idx]`**.

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Initially, `idx` was increased by `2 * n`. After this increment, `idx` is now increased by `2 * n + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
