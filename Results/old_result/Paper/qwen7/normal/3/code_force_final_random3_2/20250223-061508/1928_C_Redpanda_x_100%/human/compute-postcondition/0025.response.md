Output State: **`prime_to_i` is `factor * prime * prime_to_i`, `rest` is a non-empty list excluding its first element, `factor` is undefined, `factors[prime]` is at least 2**

Explanation: The line `prime_to_i *= prime` multiplies the current value of `prime_to_i` by `prime`. Since `prime_to_i` was initially `factor * prime_to_i`, after executing the line, `prime_to_i` becomes `factor * prime * prime_to_i`. The values of `rest`, `factor`, and `factors[prime]` remain unchanged.
