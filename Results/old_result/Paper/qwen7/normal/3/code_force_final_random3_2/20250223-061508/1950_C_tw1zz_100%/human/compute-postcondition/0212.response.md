Output State: **`h1` is '08', `m1` is equal to `m`, `h` and `m` are updated to the input values split by ':', `time` is 'AM'**.

The code simply assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. This does not affect the values of `h1`, `m1`, `h`, `m`, or any other variables. Therefore, the values of `h1` and `m1` remain unchanged, `h` and `m` retain their updated values from the input split, and `time` is now set to `'AM'`.
