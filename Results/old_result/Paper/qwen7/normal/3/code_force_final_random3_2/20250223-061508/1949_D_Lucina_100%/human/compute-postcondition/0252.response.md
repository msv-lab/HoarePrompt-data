Output State: `total` remains 0, `i` is 6, `nx` is a string that could be 'FFFFS', `j` is 9, and `n` is 4.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n + 1 - 1`, which means it will run 4 times since `n` is 4. Based on the given output states after the first three iterations, we can infer the possible value of `nx` after all iterations. Since `nx` could be 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions in the loop, and considering the pattern from the provided states, `nx` could be 'FFFFS' after all iterations. The variable `i` does not change within the loop, so it remains 6. The variable `j` starts at 7 and increases by 1 each iteration, so after 4 iterations, `j` would be 10. However, since the loop condition is `j < n + 1`, `j` will actually be 9 after the last iteration. `total` is not affected by the loop, so it remains 0.
