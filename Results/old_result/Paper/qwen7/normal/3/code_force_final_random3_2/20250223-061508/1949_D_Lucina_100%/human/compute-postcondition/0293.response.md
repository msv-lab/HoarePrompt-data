Output State: **`i` is less than `4`, `n` is `3`, `nx` is either `'SF'` or `'FS'`, `j` is `2`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the end of the string stored in `nx`. Since `nx` is either `'S'` or `'F'`, appending 'S' results in either `'SF'` or `'FS'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
