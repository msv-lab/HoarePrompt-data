Output: **YES**

Explanation:
- The initial state does not provide any specific values for the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, or `z`. However, the value of `z` is explicitly stated as 8.
- The print statement simply outputs the string 'YES', regardless of the values of other variables.
- Therefore, the output will be the string 'YES'.
