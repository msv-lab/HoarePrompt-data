Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(1, 1)
    print(1, 2)
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        print(i, i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `i` is 6, `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop variable `i` will have incremented from 3 to 6 (since the loop runs from 3 to `n` inclusive and prints each value of `i`). The variable `n` must be at least 6 for the loop to run exactly 3 times. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 8, `n` is greater than 7.

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged and stays within the range of 1 to 50. The variable `i` is now 8, as it was incremented by the loop each time it ran. The variable `n` must still be greater than 7 for the loop to have completed all its iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `i` is 11, `n` must be at least 11.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` by 1 for each iteration, starting from 3 up to `n`. After 3 iterations, `i` is 10, meaning `n` must be at least 10. For the loop to complete all its iterations, `n` must be greater than or equal to 11. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be `n + 2`, which is 11 in this case, given that `n` is at least 11. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
