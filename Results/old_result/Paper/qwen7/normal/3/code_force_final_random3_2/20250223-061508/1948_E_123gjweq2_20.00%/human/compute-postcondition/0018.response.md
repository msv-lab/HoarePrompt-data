Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `i`. The loop runs from `0` to `not_mid - 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is currently `0`.
   - `not_mid` is greater than `0`.
   - `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is equal to `clique`.
   - `arr[left + mid + i]` is equal to `big_element - i`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by `1` each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `1`.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `not_mid`. Since `not_mid` is greater than `0`, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is within the range.

4. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be `1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `not_mid` remains unchanged and is still greater than `0`.
   - `cliquess[left + mid + i]` will be `cliquess[left + mid + 1]` (since `i` becomes `1`).
   - `arr[left + mid + i]` will be `arr[left + mid + 1]` (since `i` becomes `1`).

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `not_mid` is greater than 0, `cliquess[left + mid + 1]` is equal to `clique`, `arr[left + mid + 1]` is equal to `big_element - 1`**.
