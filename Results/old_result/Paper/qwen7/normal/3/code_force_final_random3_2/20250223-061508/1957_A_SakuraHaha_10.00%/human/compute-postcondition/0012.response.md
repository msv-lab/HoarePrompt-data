Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in cnt.values()`. This means the loop iterates over the values in the dictionary `cnt`.

2. **Determine the Variables Involved**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `x`, which takes the value of each item in `cnt.values()`.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution**: The loop will execute once for each value in the dictionary `cnt`. Since `cnt` is a dictionary where keys are elements from the list `a` and values are their counts, `x` will take on the count values (which are integers).

4. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop does not modify `ans`, `t`, `n`, or `a`, these states do not need to be adjusted. The only thing that changes during the loop is the value of `x`, but this is not something we need to adjust because it is part of the loop itself.

5. **Final State**: The final state after the loop should reflect that `x` will iterate over all the values in `cnt`, but since no other variables are modified, their states remain unchanged.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are the values in the dictionary `cnt`. However, since we cannot directly adjust the values in the dictionary, we need to ensure that the dictionary `cnt` is correctly initialized and contains the necessary counts.

**State:**
- `ans` is 0 (unchanged)
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 (unchanged)
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 (unchanged)
- `a` is a list of integers (unchanged)
- `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in the list `a` (unchanged)

Since the loop itself does not change these states, the final state remains as given in the problem statement.

**State:**
**`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in the list `a`.**
