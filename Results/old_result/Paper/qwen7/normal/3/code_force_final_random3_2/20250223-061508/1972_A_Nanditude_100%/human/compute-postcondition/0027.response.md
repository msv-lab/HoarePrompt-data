Output State: `cnt` is between 0 and n (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is `n-1`. The value of `cnt` is determined by how many times the condition `b[j] < a[i]` was true during the loop's execution. If the condition was never true, `cnt` remains 0. If it was true at least once but `i` did not reach `n` before the end of the loop, `cnt` will be between 1 and `n-1`. If `i` reaches `n` before the end of the loop, `cnt` will be `n`.
