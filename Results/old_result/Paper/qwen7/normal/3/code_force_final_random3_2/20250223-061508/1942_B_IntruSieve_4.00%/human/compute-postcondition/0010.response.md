Postcondition: **`minn` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `mex` is a list containing 0, `maxx` is 0, and the current value of `minn` is equal to the current value of `maxx`.**
