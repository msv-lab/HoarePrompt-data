Output State: `max_diff` is the maximum difference found across all elements in the array `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference found or remains unchanged, `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs or remains `None`, `i` is `n-1`, and `diff` is `A[n-1] - A[n-2]`.

In this final output state, `max_diff` will hold the greatest difference between any two consecutive elements in the array `A`, `next_max_diff` will hold the second greatest difference (or remain unchanged if no such difference was found), `index` will hold the index where `max_diff` occurs (or remain `None` if `max_diff` is `-inf`), and `i` will be the last index `n-1` that the loop processed. The variable `diff` will be the difference between the last two elements of the array `A`.
