Output State: `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `adv` is `min(a[1] - a[2] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `ans` contains `a[1] - 2`, `ans` contains `a[2] - 1 - 1`, `ans` contains `a[1] - 2 - 1`, `ans` contains `a[1] - 2 - 2`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = adv - 1`. After 3 iterations as given, `j` reaches 2. Therefore, it will run one more iteration, making `j` equal to 3. During each iteration, the value `a[i-1] - j - 1` is appended to `ans`. Given `i` remains 2 throughout, the values appended to `ans` are `a[1] - 0 - 1`, `a[1] - 1 - 1`, `a[1] - 2 - 1`, and `a[1] - 3 - 1`, which simplify to `a[1] - 1`, `a[1] - 2`, `a[1] - 3`, and `a[1] - 4`. However, since `i` is fixed at 2 and does not change, the actual values appended are `a[1] - 2`, `a[2] - 1 - 1`, `a[1] - 2 - 1`, and `a[1] - 2 - 2`. Thus, the final state of `ans` will contain these four values.
