Output State: **`mini` is equal to `arr[n-1]`, `item` is `arr[n-1]`, `res` is an input string, `maxi` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `maxi` is assigned the value 0. The values of `mini`, `item`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `n` remains an input integer greater than 0.
