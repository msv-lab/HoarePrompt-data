Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the maximum number of points you can get. Specifically, the dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` does not accurately model the optimal strategy for both players. Hereâ€™s a counterexample to illustrate this:

Consider the following input:
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```

According to the problem description, the optimal strategy for Nene is to maximize her score while minimizing your score. However, the current implementation does not account for this dual objective properly. In this specific case, the correct output should be `1`, but the program might output `2` because it does not correctly simulate Nene's optimal strategy.

To verify this, let's manually go through the steps:

1. You start with cards 1, 1, 2, and 3.
2. Nene starts with cards 2, 3, 4, and 4.

If you play optimally, the sequence could be:
- You play a 1, Nene plays a 4, you get 0 points.
- You play a 1, Nene plays a 4, you get 0 points.
- You play a 2, Nene plays a 2, you get 1 point.
- You play a 3, Nene plays a 3, you get 1 point.

Thus, the maximum points you can get is `1`.

However, the provided program might incorrectly calculate this as `2` due to its flawed dynamic programming approach. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
