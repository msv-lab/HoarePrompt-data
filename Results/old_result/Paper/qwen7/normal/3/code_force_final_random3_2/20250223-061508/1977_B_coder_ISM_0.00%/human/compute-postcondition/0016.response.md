Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list. If `x` has the bit at position `i` set (i.e., `x & pow(2, i)` is true), then `s` is a list with '1' appended to it. Otherwise, `s` is a list containing '0'. `i` remains 29.
