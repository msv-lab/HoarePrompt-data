Output State: The loop will continue to iterate from `i = mdx + 3` up to `i = n - 1`. For each iteration, if `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]`, the value of `res` will be incremented by 1. If they do not match, `res` will remain unchanged. After all iterations, `res` will hold the count of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.

In more detail, the final output state will be:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
- `i` will be the last index of the list `a` (i.e., `n - 1`).
- `res` will contain the total number of occurrences of the element `a[mdx]` in the list `a`.
