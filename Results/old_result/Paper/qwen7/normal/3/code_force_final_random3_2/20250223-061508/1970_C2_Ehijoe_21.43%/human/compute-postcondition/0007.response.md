Output State: **`empty` is True, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing one tuple (u, v), `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `nodes` is a defaultdict where all values are initially lists, `i` is 0, `nodes[u]` now contains the values `[v]` and `nodes[v]` now contains the value `[u]**.

The code updates the `nodes` dictionary such that both `nodes[u]` and `nodes[v]` now include each other. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
