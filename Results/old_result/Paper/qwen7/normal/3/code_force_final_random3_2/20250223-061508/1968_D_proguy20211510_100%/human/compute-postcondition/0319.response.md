Output State: **`resb` is the maximum value obtained from the loop's iterations, `ress` is `max(ress, paths[1] * k + paths[2] * (k - 3))`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` plus the last computed `pathb[i]`, `pres` is `paths[1] * k + paths[i]`, `i` is 6, `curr` is `paths[1] * k + paths[2] * (k - 3) + paths[6] * (k - 6)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` to `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`. Given the initial values, `i` is 5, `pres` is `paths[1] * k + paths[i]`, and `i` is updated to 6. Therefore, `curr` becomes `paths[1] * k + paths[2] * (k - 3) + paths[6] * (k - 6)`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
