The only variable in the loop head is the variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, and `t` must be greater than 0**
