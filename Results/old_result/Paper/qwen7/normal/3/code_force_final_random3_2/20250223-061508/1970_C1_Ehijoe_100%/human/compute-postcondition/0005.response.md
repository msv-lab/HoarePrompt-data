Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
