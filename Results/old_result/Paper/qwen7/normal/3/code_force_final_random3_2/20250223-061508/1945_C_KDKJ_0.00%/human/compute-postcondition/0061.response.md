Output State: **`i` is 2, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1] + S[2][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1] + S[2][1]) - (S[2][0] + S[2][1] + S[2][1])`, `ans` is 2, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
