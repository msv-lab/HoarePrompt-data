Output State: **`left` is an integer and it is increased by 1, `right` is an integer at least 3, and `new_arr` is a list containing `arr[0]`, `arr[right]`, and `arr[left-1]` if `left` does not equal `right`, otherwise `new_arr` is a list containing `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`**.

Explanation: The variable `left` is incremented by 1. The value of `right` remains unchanged since no operation was performed on it. The condition for `new_arr` depends on whether `left` equals `right`. If they are not equal, `new_arr` will contain `arr[0]`, `arr[right]`, and `arr[left-1]`. If they are equal, `new_arr` will contain `arr[0]` and `arr[1]` as per the initial state.
