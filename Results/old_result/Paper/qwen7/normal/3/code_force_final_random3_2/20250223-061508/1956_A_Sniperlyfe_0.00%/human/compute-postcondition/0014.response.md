Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice.
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though it's not used in the print statement).
- `k` is an integer input from the user.
- `q` is an integer input from the user.
- `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `qs` is a list of integers obtained from splitting another input string and converting each element to an integer (with the first element removed).
- `n` is the first element of the updated `qs`.
- `func_1(n, p)` is appended to `res`.

The `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))` statement will join the elements of `res` into a single string with spaces between them and then print that string.

Since `res` contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice, the output will be the result of `func_1(n, p)` followed by a space, and then the result of `func_1(n, p)` again.

Output: **func_1(n, p) func_1(n, p)**
