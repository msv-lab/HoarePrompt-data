Based on the initial state, `mex` is described as a non-empty list. Since no specific values or further details about the elements in the list are provided, we can only describe the general form of what will be printed.

The print statement `print(itm, end=' ')` will print the first element of the list `mex` followed by a space (`end=' '` ensures that the next print statement will continue on the same line if there were any subsequent prints).

Output: **itm (where itm is the first element of the non-empty list mex)**
