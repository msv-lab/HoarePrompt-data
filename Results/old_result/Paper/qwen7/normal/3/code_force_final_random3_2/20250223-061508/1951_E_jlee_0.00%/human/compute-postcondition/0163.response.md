Output State: **`done` is True, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string, `n` is 1, `x` is the first character of the input string, `count2` is 0, `j` is 1.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables or the overall state of the program.
