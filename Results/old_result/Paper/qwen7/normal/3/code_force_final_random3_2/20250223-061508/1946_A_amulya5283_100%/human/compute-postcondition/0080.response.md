Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of the array `a`), and an array `a` of `n` integers. It sorts the array `a` and then counts how many elements from the middle index to the end of the array are equal to the element at the middle index. The function prints the count for each test case and returns nothing.**
