Output State: **`inp` is a non-empty list of integers, `a` is the second element in `inp`, `x` is equal to `y`, and the equality comparison `x == y` has been performed but no value assignment took place.**

Explanation: The code `x == y` performs an equality comparison between `x` and `y`, but it does not assign the result of this comparison to any variable. Therefore, the values of `inp`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
