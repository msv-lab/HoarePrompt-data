Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `arr` is a list containing sorted elements starting with 1s followed by 26s, and ends with the value of `lex`.
   - `k` is 2.
   - `lex` is an integer.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - Since `k` is 2, we need to determine the value of `arr[2]`.
   - According to the initial state, `arr` starts with 1s, followed by 26s, and ends with `lex`.
     - If `lex` is greater than 26, then `arr` would look something like `[1, 1, 26, ..., lex]`.
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, then `arr` would look like `[1, 1, 26, ..., 26, lex]`.

4. **Determine `arr[2]`**:
   - Given that `arr` starts with 1s and then transitions to 26s, the first two elements of `arr` are 1s.
   - Therefore, `arr[2]` must be 26 because it is the first element in the sequence of 26s.

5. **Calculate `chr(arr[2] + 96)`**:
   - `arr[2]` is 26.
   - Adding 96 to 26 gives us 122.
   - `chr(122)` returns the character corresponding to ASCII value 122, which is `z`.

6. **Final Output**:
   - The code snippet `print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')` will print the character `z`.

Output: **z**
