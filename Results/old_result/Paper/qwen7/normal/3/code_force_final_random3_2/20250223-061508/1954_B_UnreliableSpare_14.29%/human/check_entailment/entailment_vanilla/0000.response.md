### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given array to make it non-beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if it can be made into an array of all identical elements by repeatedly applying a specific operation.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The array is initially beautiful, meaning it can be reduced to a single value by the given operation.
   - We need to find the minimum number of removals to break this property.
   - If the array already consists of all identical elements, no removals are needed, and the answer is -1.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same).
     - If the array is uniform, it prints `-1`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of removals required to break the beauty property.

4. **Detailed Breakdown**:
   - The function `func_1()` is called for each test case.
   - It checks if the array is uniform using a simple loop.
   - If the array is not uniform, it counts the occurrences of the first element (`val`) and finds the minimum count of consecutive non-uniform segments.
   - This logic ensures that the minimum number of removals is calculated correctly.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the uniform array case correctly by printing `-1`.
   - It also correctly identifies non-uniform arrays and calculates the minimum removals.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem statement provided.
