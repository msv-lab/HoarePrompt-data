Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is controlled by the expression `range(int(input()))`. This means the loop will run for as many times as the integer input provided by the user.

2. **Understand the initial state**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is the first integer input
   - `a` is the second integer input
   - `b` is the third integer input

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue to execute based on the integer input provided by the user.
   - Each iteration of the loop will take another integer input.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `range(int(input()))`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input for the next iteration, which will be the next integer input provided by the user.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

- `t` remains the same (since it is not involved in the loop control)
- `n` is the first integer input for the current iteration
- `a` is the second integer input for the current iteration
- `b` is the third integer input for the current iteration
- The next integer input will be the control for the loop, which we denote as `next_input`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, and the next integer input will control the loop.**
