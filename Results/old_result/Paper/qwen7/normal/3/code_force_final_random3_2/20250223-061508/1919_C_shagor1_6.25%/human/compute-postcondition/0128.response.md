Postcondition: `inp` is a non-empty list of integers, `a` is the third element in `inp`, `x` and `y` remain unchanged, and `ans` is determined as follows: if `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 1, `x` is set to `y`, and `a` remains the third element in `inp`.
