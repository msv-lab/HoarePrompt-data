### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the logic of the `func_2` function using the provided function summary and the problem description.

#### Function `func_2` Breakdown

1. **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**
   - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` calculates the number of screens needed for `2x2` icons.
   - `x` is adjusted by subtracting `15 * bxsfory` (since each `2x2` icon takes up 4 cells, and there are 3 columns, so 15 cells per row) plus `4 * y`.
   - `bxsfory1` is calculated as the ceiling of the adjusted `x` divided by 15 plus 1.
   - The total number of screens is `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.

2. **Case 2: Only `y` is greater than 0**
   - The number of screens needed is the ceiling of `y / 2`.

3. **Case 3: Only `x` is greater than 0**
   - The number of screens needed is the ceiling of `x / 15`.

4. **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**
   - The number of screens needed is 0.

#### Testing the Logic with Examples

Let's re-test the logic with the provided examples:

#### Example 1: `1 1`
- `x = 1`, `y = 1`
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(1 / 2) = 1`
- `x = 1 - 15 * 1 + 4 * 1 = 1 - 15 + 4 = -10` (Should be 1 - 4 = -3, but since we can't have negative icons, it should be 1)
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(1 / 15) + 1 = 1`
- Total screens = `1 + 1 = 2` (Correct, should be 1)

#### Example 2: `7 2`
- `x = 7`, `y = 2`
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(2 / 2) = 1`
- `x = 7 - 15 * 1 + 4 * 2 = 7 - 15 + 8 = 0`
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(0 / 15) + 1 = 1`
- Total screens = `1 + 1 = 2` (Correct, should be 1)

#### Example 3: `12 4`
- `x = 12`, `y = 4`
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(4 / 2) = 2`
- `x = 12 - 15 * 2 + 4 * 4 = 12 - 30 + 16 = -2` (Should be 12 - 20 + 16 = 8)
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(8 / 15) + 1 = 1`
- Total screens = `1 + 2 = 3` (Correct, should be 2)

#### Example 4: `0 3`
- `x = 0`, `y = 3`
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(3 / 2) = 2`
- Total screens = `2` (Correct)

#### Example 5: `1 0`
- `x = 1`, `y = 0`
- `bxsfory = 0`
- `x = 1`
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(1 / 15) + 1 = 1`
- Total screens = `1` (Correct)

#### Example 6: `8 1`
- `x = 8`, `y = 1`
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(1 / 2) = 1`
- `x = 8 - 15 * 1 + 4 * 1 = 8 - 15 + 4 = -3` (Should be 8 - 4 = 4)
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(4 / 15) + 1 = 1`
- Total screens = `1 + 1 = 2` (Correct, should be 1)

#### Example 7: `0 0`
- `x = 0`, `y = 0`
- Total screens = `0` (Correct)

#### Example 8: `2 0`
- `x = 2`, `y = 0`
- `bxsfory = 0`
- `x = 2`
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(2 / 15) + 1 = 1`
- Total screens = `1` (Correct)

#### Example 9: `15 0`
- `x = 15`, `y = 0`
- `bxsfory = 0`
- `x = 15`
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(15 / 15) + 1 = 2`
- Total screens = `2` (Correct)

#### Example 10: `8 2`
- `x = 8`, `y = 2`
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(2 / 2) = 1`
- `x = 8 - 15 * 1 + 4 * 2 = 8 - 15 + 8 = 1`
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(1 / 15) + 1 = 1`
- Total screens = `1 + 1 = 2` (Correct)

#### Example 11: `0 9`
- `x = 0`, `y = 9`
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(9 / 2) = 5`
- Total screens = `5` (Correct)

### Conclusion

Upon re-evaluating the logic, we can see that the function still has issues with the adjustments for `x` and `y`. The logic for calculating the number of screens needed is flawed, leading to incorrect results in multiple cases.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
