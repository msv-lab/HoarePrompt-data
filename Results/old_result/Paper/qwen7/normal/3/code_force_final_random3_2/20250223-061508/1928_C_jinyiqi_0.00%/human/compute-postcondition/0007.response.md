Postcondition: `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `output1` is a list containing 1, `output2` is a list containing the integer value of `x / 2`. If `x % i == 0`, then `x` is divided by 2 and the result is added to `output2`; otherwise, `output1` and `output2` remain unchanged.
