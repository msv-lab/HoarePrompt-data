Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of the new input string, `count` is 1, `count2` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, and the first element of `s` is now the first character of `string`. We continue the loop or statement we were inside.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables and the program continues with the next iteration of the loop or statement, the values of all variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.
