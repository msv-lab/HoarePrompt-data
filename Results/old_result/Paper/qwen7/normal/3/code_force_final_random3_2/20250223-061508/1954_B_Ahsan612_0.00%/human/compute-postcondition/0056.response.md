Output State: **`same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `i` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is infinity, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
