The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of houses, and `a`, a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. It calculates the optimal index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `i` and `n/2` while ensuring that the number of '0's to the left of `i` is at least half the number of positions to the left of `i`, and the number of '1's to the right of `i` is at least half the number of positions to the right of `i`. If no such index exists, it returns `-1`. The function returns the optimal index `i` or `-1`.
