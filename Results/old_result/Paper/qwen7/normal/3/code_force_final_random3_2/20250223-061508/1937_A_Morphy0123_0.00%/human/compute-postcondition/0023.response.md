Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` ranges from 0 to `n_cases - 1`.
   - The loop itself does not directly modify `n_cases`, `power`, or `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n_cases`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n_cases` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `i` is either 1 or the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15.
   - `n` must be an input integer, and `power` is either equal to or not equal to `n` depending on the condition in the if statement.
   - If `n` equals 1, `i` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15, and `n` must be greater than \(2^{15} = 32768\).

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is one less than the current value of `i`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n_cases`.

Given the current state:
- `i` is either 1 or the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15.
- `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n_cases` remains the same.

If `i` was 1, it becomes 2. If `i` was the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15, it becomes `i + 1`.

Since `n_cases` is unchanged and `i` is incremented, the new state is:

State: **`n_cases` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be an input integer, and `power` is either equal to or not equal to `n` depending on the condition in the if statement.**

To be specific:
- If `i` was 1, then `i` is now 2.
- If `i` was the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15, then `i` is now `i + 1`.

So, the final state can be summarized as:

State: **`n_cases` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2 (if it was 1) or `i + 1` (if it was the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15), `n` must be an input integer, and `power` is either equal to or not equal to `n` depending on the condition in the if statement.**
