Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `res` is 0**

Explanation: The line `res = 0` initializes the variable `res` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables `t`, `n`, or `a`. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `res` is set to 0.
