Output State: **`ans` is -1, `i` is 1, `lsum` is 0, `rsum` is `n - 0`, we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `ans`, `i`, `lsum`, and `rsum`, along with the indication that the loop continues.
