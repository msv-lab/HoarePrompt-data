Postcondition: `i` is 4, `not_c` is False, and `A` is False.

Explanation: Given the initial state where `i` is 4, `not_c` is False, and `A` is False, the if statement checks whether `not_c` is False. Since `not_c` is indeed False, the if block is executed. The if block does not alter the values of `i`, `not_c`, or `A` further, so they remain as 4, False, and False respectively. Therefore, the overall postcondition after the if else block executes is that `i` is 4, `not_c` is False, and `A` is False.
