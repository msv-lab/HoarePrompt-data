Functionality: **The function processes multiple sets of three non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) representing the counts of introverts, extroverts, and universals respectively. For each set, it calculates a value based on specific conditions involving \(b\) and \(c\). If certain conditions are met, it increments a cumulative count \(k\). Finally, it prints the accumulated value \(k\) for each set of inputs.**
