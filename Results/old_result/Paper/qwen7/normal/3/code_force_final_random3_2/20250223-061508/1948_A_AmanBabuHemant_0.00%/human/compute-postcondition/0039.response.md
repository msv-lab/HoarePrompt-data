Output State: **t must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is either '110' repeated `n // 2` times (if `n % 2` is not true) or remains unchanged from the precondition.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` will be reduced by the number of iterations, which is equal to its initial value. Since `t` starts between 1 and 50, after 50 iterations, it would reach 0. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 0, which means `t` effectively becomes 0. The values of `n` and `s` will follow the same rules as described in the previous states, with `s` being '110' repeated `n // 2` times if `n` is even and the length of `s` is less than 200.
