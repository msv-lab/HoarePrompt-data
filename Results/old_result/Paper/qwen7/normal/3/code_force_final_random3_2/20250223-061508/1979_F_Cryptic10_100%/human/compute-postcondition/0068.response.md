Output State: **`vx` has one less element than before, `v1` is no longer in `vx`, and `v2` is the new last element of `vx`; `ops` is a list containing a tuple `(v1, v2)`**.

This means that the operation `ops += [(v1, v2)]` has added a tuple containing `v1` and `v2` to the list `ops`. The precondition that `vx` had one less element than before, `v1` was removed from `vx`, and `v2` became the new last element of `vx` remains true after the code execution.
