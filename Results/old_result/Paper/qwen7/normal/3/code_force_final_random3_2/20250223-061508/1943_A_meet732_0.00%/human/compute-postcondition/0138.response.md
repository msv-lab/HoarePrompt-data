Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( n \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers. For each test case, it constructs a frequency count of the numbers in the list \( a \) using the `cntl` list. It then checks if any number in \( a \) appears fewer than 2 times (excluding zero). If such a number exists, it prints the smallest one; otherwise, it prints nothing.**
