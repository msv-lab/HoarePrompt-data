Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing '1', `i` is 30**.

The code `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the list `s`. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, and `i` is 30 is still valid.
