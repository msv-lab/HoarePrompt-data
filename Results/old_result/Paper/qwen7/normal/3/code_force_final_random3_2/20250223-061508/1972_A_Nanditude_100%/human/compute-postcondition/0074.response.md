Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is 2 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, otherwise `cnt` is 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is `n-2`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `t` is decreased by 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
   - `b` is a list of integers obtained from input.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop runs as long as `j < n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 (assuming `j` starts from `n-2`).
   - Therefore, `j` will become `n-1`.
   - `n` remains the same as it does not change within the loop.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `cnt` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it.
   - `i` remains 2 as it is not modified in the loop.
   - `j` changes to `n-1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `t` is decreased by 1, so it will be further decreased.
   - `a` and `b` remain the same as they are not modified in the loop.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`cnt` is 2 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, otherwise `cnt` is 1, `i` is 2, `j` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is further decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input**.
