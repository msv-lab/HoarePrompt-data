Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for j in range(n // 2 - 1):`. The variables involved in this loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus 2 times the value of `s[x]`.
   - `x` is increased by 1.
   - `s` remains unchanged.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs as long as `j < n // 2 - 1`. This means that at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was less than `n // 2 - 1`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `x` is increased by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `x` must have been equal to the current value of `x` plus 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n // 2 - 1`. Therefore, `j` should be incremented by 1.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `ans` remains unchanged from the previous state.
   - `x` is increased by 1 from the previous state.
   - `j` is increased by 1 from the previous state.
   - `s` remains unchanged.

Given the above steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ans` is the original value of `ans` plus 2 times the value of `s[x]`, `x` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1, `s` remains unchanged.**
