### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to place \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
   - The goal is to output a configuration that maximizes the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` as input, indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, representing the size of the grid.
   - The function always prints the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
   - If `n` is 3, it additionally prints `(2, 3)`.
   - For `n > 3`, it prints `(1, 4)` and then prints pairs of coordinates from `(4, 4)` to `(n, n)`.

3. **Checking the Output for Different Values of `n`**:
   - **For \( n = 2 \)**:
     - Output: `1 1\n1 2`
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1\}\)
     - This matches the expected output.

   - **For \( n = 3 \)**:
     - Output: `1 1\n1 2\n2 3`
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\)
     - This matches the expected output.

   - **For \( n = 4 \)**:
     - Output: `1 1\n1 2\n2 4\n4 4\n4 5`
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\)
     - This does not match the expected output, as the expected output should include all possible distances up to \( n-1 \). The correct output should be `1 1\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5`.

   - **For \( n = 5 \)**:
     - Output: `1 1\n1 2\n2 4\n4 4\n4 6`
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\)
     - This does not match the expected output, as the expected output should include all possible distances up to \( n-1 \). The correct output should be `1 1\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n5 6`.

   - **For \( n = 6 \)**:
     - Output: `1 1\n1 2\n2 4\n4 4\n4 7`
     - Distinct Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}\)
     - This does not match the expected output, as the expected output should include all possible distances up to \( n-1 \). The correct output should be `1 1\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n5 6\n6 7`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not correctly generate the maximum set of distinct Manhattan distances for \( n > 3 \).
   - The solution only works for \( n = 2 \) and \( n = 3 \), but fails for larger values of \( n \).
