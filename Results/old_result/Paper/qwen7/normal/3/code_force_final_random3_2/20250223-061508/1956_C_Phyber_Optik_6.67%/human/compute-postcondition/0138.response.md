Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `r` is any non-negative integer.
- `j` is `j_prev + 1` where `j_prev` was less than or equal to `n + r`.

The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we will express the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **1 2 ... n** (where `n` is the value of `n` and the range includes all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive)
