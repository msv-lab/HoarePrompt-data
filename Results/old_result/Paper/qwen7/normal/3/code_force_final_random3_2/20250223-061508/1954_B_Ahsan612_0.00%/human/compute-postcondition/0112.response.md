Output State: **`same` is 2, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 2, `num` is `ar[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The line `minn = min(minn, same)` updates `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value and `same`, which is 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
