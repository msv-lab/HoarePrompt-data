Output State: **`ans` is 1, `n` is 1, `m` is the second integer input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `res` is a list containing one element which is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 1. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, or `res`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
