Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `mak` is `i`, `n` must be at least 3, `s` is an input string, `pans` is a list containing the value of `i` from the previous iteration, which is `[i]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pans = [i]` updates the list `pans` to include the current value of `i`, which is `n + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
