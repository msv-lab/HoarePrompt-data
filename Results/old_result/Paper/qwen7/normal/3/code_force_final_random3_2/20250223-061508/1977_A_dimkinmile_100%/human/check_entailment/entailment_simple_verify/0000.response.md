### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to verify the correctness of the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Nikita can only add or remove exactly one cube per move.
- After \( n \) moves, the resulting tower must have exactly \( m \) cubes.
- The difference between \( n \) and \( m \) must be even and non-negative for it to be possible to achieve \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves.

#### Given Program:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

#### Annotated Code:
- The program iterates over \( t \) test cases.
- For each test case, it calls `func_1()` and passes two integers \( n \) and \( m \).
- Inside `func_1()`, it checks if \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( n - m \geq 0 \).
- If both conditions are met, it prints "Yes".
- Otherwise, it prints "No".

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program incorrectly handles the case where \( n < m \) and suggests adding the condition `n >= m`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Case \( n \geq m \)**:
   - If \( n \geq m \), then \( n - m \) is non-negative.
   - If \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \), it means the difference is even, which is valid since Nikita can add or remove cubes in pairs.
   - This part of the logic is correct.

2. **Case \( n < m \)**:
   - If \( n < m \), then \( n - m \) is negative.
   - The condition \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \) is irrelevant because \( n - m \) is negative.
   - The program correctly prints "No" because it is impossible to end up with more cubes than the number of moves.

3. **Edge Case \( n = m \)**:
   - If \( n = m \), then \( n - m = 0 \), which is even.
   - The program correctly prints "Yes" because no moves are needed.

#### Conclusion:
The given program already correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement. It checks if \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \) and ensures \( n - m \geq 0 \). There is no need to add the condition `n >= m` because the current logic already covers all necessary scenarios.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was inaccurate because the given program correctly implements the logic required to determine if it is possible to end up with \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves.
