Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is an input integer (its specific value is not provided).
- `r` is explicitly given as 0.
- The current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

This statement will print the integer 1, followed by the value of `j`, which is 1, and then a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **1 1**
