Output State: **`rep` is 60, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is the last value appended to `tab` during the 60th iteration, and `tab` is a list containing the string representations of numbers from 0 to 59 inclusive.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (which it does since `t` is the number of times the loop runs and we assume `t` is within the given constraints), the following conditions hold:
- The variable `rep` reaches its maximum limit of 60 because the loop exits only when `n` becomes 0, `k` becomes 0, or `rep` reaches 60.
- Since `n` is reduced to 0 through the loop's operations, `n` will be 0.
- `k` will also be 0 as the loop continues to subtract `Min` and `Max` until `k` is depleted.
- `Min` and `Max` will both be 0 since they are set to 0 at the start of each new iteration and no further updates are made once the loop exits.
- `number` will be the last value appended to `tab` during the 60th iteration.
- `tab` will contain the string representations of the numbers from 0 to 59 inclusive, as the loop iterates 60 times appending each `number` to the list.
