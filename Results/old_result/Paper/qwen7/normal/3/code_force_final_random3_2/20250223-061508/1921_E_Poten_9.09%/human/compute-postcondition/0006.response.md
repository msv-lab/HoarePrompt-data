Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and either the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues` or the first element of `clues` is equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The length of `test_cases`, the initial value of `i`, and the condition involving `clues` remain unchanged. Therefore, these details are included in the output state.
