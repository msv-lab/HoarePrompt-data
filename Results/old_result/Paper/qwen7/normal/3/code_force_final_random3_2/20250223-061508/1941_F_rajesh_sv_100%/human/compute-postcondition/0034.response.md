Output State: **`i` is 6, `diff` is `A[6] - A[5]`, `max_diff` is `diff`**

Explanation: The code updates `max_diff` to be equal to `diff`. Since `diff` is defined as `A[6] - A[5]`, `max_diff` now holds the same value as `diff`. The values of `i` and `diff` remain unchanged from their initial states.
