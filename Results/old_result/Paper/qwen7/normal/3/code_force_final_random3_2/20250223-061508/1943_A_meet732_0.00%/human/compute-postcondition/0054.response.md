Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cntl[i]` is increased by 1.
   - `a` must not be empty.
   - `i` is the next element in `a`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `a` must still contain elements (i.e., it must not be empty).
   - `i` will be the next element in `a`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `a` must not be empty for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `a` still contains elements.
   - `i` will be the next element in `a`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `a` must not be empty.
- `i` will be the next element in `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`cntl[i]` is increased by 1, `a` must not be empty, `i` is the next element in `a`**
