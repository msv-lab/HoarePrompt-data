Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `x` is the minimum value in the list `inp`.
- `y` is the second smallest value in the list `inp`.
- `ans` is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than `y`.
- `inp` is the same list as before.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than `y`.

To determine the value of `ans`, we need to know the specific values in `inp`, but since those are not provided, we can only describe it in terms of the list `inp`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the count of elements in inp that are greater than y)**
