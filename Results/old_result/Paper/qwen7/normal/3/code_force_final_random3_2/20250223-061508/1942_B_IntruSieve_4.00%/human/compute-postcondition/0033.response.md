Postcondition: `minn` is either `maxx` + 1 or `maxx` + 2, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `mex` is a list containing either the absolute difference between each element in `arr` and `minn`, followed by `minn`, or one additional element which is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`, and `maxx` is updated to the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` if `abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1.
