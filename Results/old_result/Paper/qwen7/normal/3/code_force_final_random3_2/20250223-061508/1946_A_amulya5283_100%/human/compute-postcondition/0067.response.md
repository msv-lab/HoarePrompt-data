Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `n` is an input integer.
- `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
- If `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]`, then `res` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(mdx, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the range function.
   - `mdx` is a constant determined before the loop starts and does not change within the loop.
   - `n` is a constant determined before the loop starts and does not change within the loop.
   - `a` is the array being iterated over, but its state is not directly modified by the loop head.
   - `res` is a variable that might be modified inside the loop body, but we are only concerned with the loop head here.

2. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop starts from `mdx` and goes up to `n-1`, the value of `i` will be incremented by 1 at each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `mdx + 1`.

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was `mdx`, so for the next iteration, `i` should be `mdx + 1`.

### Updated State
- `mdx` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `i` is updated to `mdx + 1`.
- `res` is not directly affected by the loop head, so it remains the same.

### Final Answer
State: **`n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, and `res` remains unchanged.**

So, the final state is:
State: **`n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, and `res` remains unchanged.**
