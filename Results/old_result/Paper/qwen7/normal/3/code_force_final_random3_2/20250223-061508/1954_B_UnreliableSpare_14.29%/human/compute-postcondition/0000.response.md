Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`.**

This means that the value of `t` remains unchanged, the value of `n` is updated to the integer input from the user, and the array `a` is yet to be defined as per the initial state.
