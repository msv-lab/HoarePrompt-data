Output State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` is `n`, `i` is 0, `pans` is ['0'], `s` is the string '<', `n` is the input integer from the user.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the current value of `i` (which is 0) to the list `pans`. Therefore, `pans` becomes a list containing the single element '0'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
