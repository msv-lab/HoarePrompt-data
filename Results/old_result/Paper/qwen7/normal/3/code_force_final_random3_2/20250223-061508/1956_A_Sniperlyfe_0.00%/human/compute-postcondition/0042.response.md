Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for n in qs:`. The variables involved here are `n` and `qs`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `qs` is a list of integers with at least two elements.
   - `n` is the second element of `qs`.
   - `res` is a list with two elements where each element is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more elements in `qs` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `n` is the second element of `qs`, after the first iteration, `n` would have been set to the second element of `qs`.
   - For the loop to continue, `qs` must still have at least one more element (the third element).

5. **Update the States**:
   - `qs` should now be a list with at least three elements (since it had at least two elements initially and one was consumed in the first iteration).
   - `n` should now be the third element of `qs`.
   - `res` is not directly affected by the loop head, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: `qs` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `n` is the third element of `qs`, `res` is a list with two elements where each element is the result of `func_1(n, p)`**.
