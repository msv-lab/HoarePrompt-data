t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n represents the integers on the cards in your hand, and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
