Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `tab`.

2. **Understand the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is the second element of `tab`.
   - `tab` is a list containing at least 60 elements.
   - `rep` is 60.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `Min` is 0.
   - `Max` is 0.
   - `number` is the last value appended to `tab` during the 60th iteration.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop iterates over each element in `tab`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `tab` for `i` to iterate over.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently the second element of `tab`, the next value of `i` will be the third element of `tab`.
   - The list `tab` will still contain at least 60 elements because no elements have been removed or modified in the loop body (based on the given information).

5. **Adjust the other variables**: The variables `rep`, `n`, `k`, `Min`, `Max`, and `number` are not directly affected by the loop head and do not need to be updated for the next iteration based on the information provided.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`i` is the third element of `tab`, `tab` is a list containing at least 60 elements, `rep` is 60, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is the last value appended to `tab` during the 60th iteration.**

State: **`i` is the third element of `tab`, `tab` is a list containing at least 60 elements, `rep` is 60, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is the last value appended to `tab` during the 60th iteration**
