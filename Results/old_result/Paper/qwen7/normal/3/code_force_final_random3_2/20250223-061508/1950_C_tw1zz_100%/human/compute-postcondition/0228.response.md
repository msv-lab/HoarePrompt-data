Output State: **`h1` is '04', `m1` is equal to `m`, `h` and `m` are updated to the input values split by ':', `time` is 'PM'**.

The code simply assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. This does not affect the values of `h1`, `m1`, `h`, `m`, or any other variables. Therefore, the values of `h1`, `m1`, `h`, `m`, and `time` remain as they were before the assignment.
