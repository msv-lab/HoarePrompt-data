Output State: **`prev` is `s`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `tree` is a list containing `s`, `curr` is `nodes[s][0]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `nodes[s][0]` to the variable `curr`. The other variables (`prev`, `s`, `e`, and `tree`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
