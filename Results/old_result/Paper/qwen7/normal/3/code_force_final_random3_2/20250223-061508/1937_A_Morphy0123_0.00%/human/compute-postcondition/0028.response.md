Output State: **`power` is 2, `n_cases` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2 (if it was 1) or `i + 1` (if it was the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15), and `n` must be greater than 2.**

Explanation: The code `power += 1` increments the value of `power` by 1. Initially, `power` is 1, so after executing the code, `power` becomes 2. The values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
