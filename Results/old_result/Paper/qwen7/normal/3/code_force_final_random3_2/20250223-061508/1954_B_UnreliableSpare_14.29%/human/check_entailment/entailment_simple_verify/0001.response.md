### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made into an array of all identical elements by repeatedly applying a specific operation.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The array is initially beautiful, meaning it can be reduced to a single value by the given operation.
   - We need to find the minimum number of removals to break this property.
   - If the array already consists of all identical elements, no removals are needed, and the answer is -1.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same).
     - If the array is uniform, it prints `-1`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of removals required to break the beauty property.

4. **Detailed Breakdown**:
   - The function `func_1()` is called for each test case.
   - It checks if the array is uniform using a simple loop.
   - If the array is not uniform, it counts the occurrences of the first element (`val`) and finds the minimum count of consecutive non-uniform segments.
   - This logic ensures that the minimum number of removals is calculated correctly.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the uniform array case correctly by printing `-1`.
   - However, there is a flaw in the logic for calculating the minimum number of removals. The code only considers the first element (`val`) and does not account for other possible starting elements in the array.

6. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code confirms that the array is checked for uniformity and the minimum number of removals is calculated based on the first element.
   - The logic for finding the minimum number of removals is flawed because it only considers the first element and does not consider other possible starting points for consecutive segments.

7. **Correctness**:
   - The code fails to handle cases where the array is not uniform but the minimum number of removals should be calculated differently.
   - For example, in the test case `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the code correctly identifies that one removal is needed, but it does not handle more complex cases correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly calculate the minimum number of removals for all test cases. The logic is flawed and does not account for all possible starting points for consecutive segments.

### Final:
**False**
