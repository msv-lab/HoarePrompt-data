Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer, `test_cases` is a list containing a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `idx` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The line `idx += 2` increments the value of `idx` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
