Output State: **`i` is 2; `adv` is `min(a[1] - a[2] - 1, cnt, cur)`**

Explanation: The variable `adv` is assigned the value of the minimum between `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`. Given that `i` is 2, `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]`, and `a[i]` is `a[2]`. Therefore, `adv` is calculated as `min(a[1] - a[2] - 1, cnt, cur)`. The values of `i`, `cnt`, `cur`, and `a` (except for `a[1]` and `a[2]`) remain unchanged from the initial state.
