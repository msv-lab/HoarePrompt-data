Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values of the integers entered by the user during the input. This holds true whether the condition `2 * a < b` is met or not.**
