Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \). For each test case, it calculates a sequence of integers stored in `mex` based on the input array and a variable `minn`. After processing all test cases, it prints the elements of `mex` for each test case. The final state of the program includes the printed sequence of integers for each test case, while the input variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.**
