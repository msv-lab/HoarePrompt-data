Output State: **`card` is split into `rank` and `suit`; `trumps` remains unchanged; `answers` is appended with a string ' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]).**

Explanation: The code appends to the list `answers` a string created by joining elements from a list comprehension. The list comprehension sorts `[suits[suit], rank]` and then concatenates each element of the sorted list with `suit`. Since the exact values of `suits[suit]`, `rank`, and `suit` are not provided, we keep them in their general form. The `trumps` variable remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
