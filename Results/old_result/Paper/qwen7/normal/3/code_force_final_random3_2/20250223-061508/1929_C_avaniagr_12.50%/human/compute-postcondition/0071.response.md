Postcondition: `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` are integers. If `x` is less than `k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 1`, then no changes are made to `k`, `x`, `a`, or `t`. If `x` equals `k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, then no changes are made to `k`, `x`, `a`, or `t`. Otherwise, `x` is a non-negative integer, `z` is the sum of `z` initialized to 0 plus the value of `z // (k - 1) + 1` added for each iteration from 0 to `x`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `z` if the if condition is true, and `a` is less than `z` if the else condition is true.
