Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `output1` is a list containing 1, `output2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is initially 1) to the list `output1`. After appending, `i` is incremented to 2 due to the condition \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\). The other variables remain unchanged.
