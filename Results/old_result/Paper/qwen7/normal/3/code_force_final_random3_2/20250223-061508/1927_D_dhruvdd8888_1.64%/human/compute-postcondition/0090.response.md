Based on the initial state provided:

- `eli` is the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`. This means `eli` is the position where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted into `arr` to keep it sorted.
- `N` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `N + 1`.
- `l` and `r` are assigned the values from the tuple split by space and converted to integers.
- `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.
- `tc` is greater than 5.
- `s`, `e`, and `_` are updated to the values from the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.

The `print(-1, -1)` statement simply prints the values `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
