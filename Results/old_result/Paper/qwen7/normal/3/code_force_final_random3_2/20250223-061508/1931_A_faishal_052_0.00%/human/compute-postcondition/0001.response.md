Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `cases`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `cases`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be 0 (or 1 if the loop starts from 1), and `cases` must be a positive integer.

3. **Initial Values**:
   - `cases` is given as an input integer with the constraint \(1 \leq cases \leq 100\).
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be initialized to 0 (or 1 if the loop starts from 1).

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can start executing. Specifically, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 0 (or 1) and `cases` is a valid positive integer within the specified range.

**State:**
- `cases` is an input integer, \(1 \leq cases \leq 100\).
- `i` is 0 (or 1 if the loop starts from 1).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`total` is not mentioned, `i` is 0 (or 1 if the loop starts from 1), `cases` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq cases \leq 100\)**.
