Based on the initial state provided:

- `power` is explicitly given as 15.
- `i` is explicitly given as 15.
- `n` must be greater than \(2^{15} = 32768\), and it is also stated that the current value of `power` is equal to `n`. Since `power` is 15, this implies that `n` is 15.
- `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), but its value is not relevant to the print statement.

The print statement is `print(2 ** power)`. Given that `power` is 15, the expression `2 ** power` calculates \(2^{15}\).

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the value of \(2^{15}\).

Output: **32768**
