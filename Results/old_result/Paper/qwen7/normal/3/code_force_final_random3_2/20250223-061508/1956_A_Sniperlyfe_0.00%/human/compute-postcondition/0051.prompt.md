You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k and q are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100; p is a list of k positive integers where 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100; qs is a list of q positive integers where 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = []
        
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
            print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
        
    #State: Output State: `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, for all iterations of the loop. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is an integer input from the user. After all iterations, `res` will contain `t * len(qs)` elements, with each element being the result of applying `func_1` to each integer in `qs` for each iteration of the loop. The values of `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` remain as they were after the last iteration of the loop, and `t` is reduced to 0 after all iterations have completed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but works with predefined lists k and q, where k and q are positive integers within the range of 1 to 100, and p is a list of k positive integers in ascending order within the range of 1 to 100, and qs is a list of q positive integers within the range of 1 to 100. The function returns a result based on the relationship between the elements of p and qs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
