Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 Analysis**: This function correctly calculates the number of pairs (integers with a count of exactly 2) in the list `a`. It then returns the minimum value between the number of such pairs and half the number of cards in your hand (`n // 2`). This logic aligns with the problem statement, as it determines the maximum number of points you can get by ensuring that you do not give Nene too many opportunities to score points.

2. **Function 2 Analysis**: This function reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` three times for each test case. The results are stored in a list `results` and printed out. Given that the problem specifies that each test case should be processed independently and the results should be printed for each test case, calling `func_1` three times per test case seems unnecessary and could lead to incorrect results if the problem description changes in the future. However, since the problem description indicates that each test case should be handled independently and the results should be printed, this function is designed to handle multiple test cases as required.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**: The overall program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get by ensuring that you do not give Nene too many opportunities to score points. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the number of pairs and ensures that the result is within the constraints of the problem. Function `func_2` correctly processes each test case and prints the results, even though it calls `func_1` three times for each test case, which is redundant but does not affect the correctness of the solution for the given problem.

Given the above analysis, the program is designed to meet the problem requirements and the provided examples confirm that the logic works as intended.

Correctness: **True**
