The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a`, which is a list of `n` integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, and `n`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Each integer in the list `a` is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9. Based on the given cases, the function returns either 1 or 2. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`, and return either 1 or 2 based on certain conditions that are not specified in the provided information.
