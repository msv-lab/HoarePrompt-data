Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `num` is equal to `nums[0]`, and `arr` contains a tuple (2, 0, num).**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `num`. Since `i` is 0, `num` is assigned the first element of the list `nums`, which is `nums[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
