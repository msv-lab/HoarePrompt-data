Output State: **`i` is 2; `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`; `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is assigned the value 0. The values of `i` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `ans` is still the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and now `cnt` is explicitly set to 0.
