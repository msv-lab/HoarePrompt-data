Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop `for j in range(4, n + 1):` will execute if `n` is greater than 3 (since the range starts from 4).
3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 3, as this is the minimum value required for the loop to start. The other variables `j` and `i` will be initialized within the loop itself.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50
- `n` is an input integer
- `i` is 0
- `n` is not equal to 3

We need to focus on adjusting the state of `n` to ensure the loop can execute. The other variables (`t`, `i`) are not directly related to the loop's execution and do not need adjustment based on the loop head.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to be greater than 3.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 0**
