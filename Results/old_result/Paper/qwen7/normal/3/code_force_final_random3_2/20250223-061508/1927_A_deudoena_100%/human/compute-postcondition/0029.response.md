Output State: **`d` is increased by 1, `s` is a sequence of 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one 'B', `j` is the last 'B' in the reversed string `s[::-1]`, `c` is the length of `s`, `mi` is the index of the first 'B' in the original string `s`, and `ma` is the length of `s` - `d`.**

Explanation: The code `ma = len(s) - d` calculates the value of `ma` by subtracting the value of `d` from the length of the string `s`. The values of `s`, `j`, `c`, `mi`, and `d` remain unchanged. Therefore, `ma` is updated to the value of `len(s) - d`.
