Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, where `x` represents the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and `y` represents the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon. The function processes this input data for each test case without returning any value.**
