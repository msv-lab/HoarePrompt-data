Output State: **`left` is 1, `right` is greater than or equal to 0, and `new_arr` is a list containing either the element `arr[0]` (if `left` equals `right`) or the elements `arr[0]` and `arr[right]`.**

Explanation: The variable `left` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The conditions and values of `right` and `new_arr` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
