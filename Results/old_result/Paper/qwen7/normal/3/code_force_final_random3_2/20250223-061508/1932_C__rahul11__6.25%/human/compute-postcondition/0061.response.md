Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `ans` is the product of `ans` and `i`.**

Explanation: The code `ans *= i` multiplies the current value of `ans` by the value of `i`. Since `i` is the next element in `arr`, the updated value of `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` up to the current element `i`. The precondition that `arr` must contain at least one element and `i` is the next element in `arr` remains valid.
