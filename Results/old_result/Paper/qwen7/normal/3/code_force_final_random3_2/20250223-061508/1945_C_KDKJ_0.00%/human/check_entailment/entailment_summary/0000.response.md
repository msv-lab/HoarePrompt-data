Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's as it iterates through the string `a`.
   - It then checks for each position `i` whether placing the road after house `i` satisfies the condition that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
   - Specifically, it checks if `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` where `left` is the count of '0's and `lsum` is the total count of residents on the left side, and `right` is the count of '1's and `rsum` is the total count of residents on the right side.
   - If the condition is met, it updates the answer `ans` if the current position `i` is closer to the middle of the village (`abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)`), or if it is equally close but smaller than the current answer.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is designed to handle multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - However, the provided code snippet for `func_2` only shows a loop that calls `func_1` three times regardless of the actual number of test cases `t`.

Given the problem statement, `func_2` should read the number of test cases `t` and call `func_1` exactly `t` times. The current implementation of `func_2` only calls `func_1` three times, which is incorrect if `t` is greater than 3.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic for handling multiple test cases. It should read the number of test cases `t` and call `func_1` exactly `t` times, not just three times. Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the provided problem description.
