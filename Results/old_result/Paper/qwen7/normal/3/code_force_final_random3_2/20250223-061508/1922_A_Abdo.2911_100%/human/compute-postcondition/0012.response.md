Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the value of `a[0]` is equal to the value of `b[0]`. The current value of `c[0]` is not equal to the value of `a[0]`. `possible` is True.**

Explanation: The variable `possible` is assigned the boolean value `True`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `a[0]`, `b[0]`, or `c[0]`. Therefore, the postconditions remain the same, and `possible` is now set to `True`.
