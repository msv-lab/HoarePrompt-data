Postcondition: `i` is 1, `left` is `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is `S[1][0] + S[1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[1][0] + S[1][1])`, `ans` is 1, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]`. If the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` is updated to 1.
