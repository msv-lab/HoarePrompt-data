You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        tmp = a[0]
        
        aa = set(a)
        
        if len(aa) == 1:
            print(-1)
        
        cnt = 0
        
        ans = n
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == tmp:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                ans = min(ans, cnt)
                cnt = 0
        
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `ans` will hold the overall minimum value of `cnt` encountered across all iterations, `t` will be 0, `i` will be `n-1`, `tmp` will be equal to the last element of the list `a`, `cnt` will be 0, and `aa` will still contain all elements of the list `a` as a set.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It returns a result based on the processing of these inputs for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
