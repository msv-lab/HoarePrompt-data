Output State: **`i` is 2, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1] + S[2][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1] + S[2][1])`, and `ans` is either 0 or 1.**

Explanation: The code updates `lsum` to `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, which means `lsum` is now `S[2][0] + S[2][1] + S[2][1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
