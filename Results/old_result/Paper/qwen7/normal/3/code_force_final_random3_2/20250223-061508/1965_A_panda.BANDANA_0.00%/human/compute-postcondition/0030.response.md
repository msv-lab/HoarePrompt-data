Output State: **t is an input integer, i is t-1, n is an input integer, l is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, e is a set containing unique elements from the list l, m is the length of the list l.**

In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `t-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `e`, and `m`) retain their last assigned values from the last iteration of the loop. The value of `n` and `m` will be the inputs from the last test case processed, and `l` will be the list of integers from the last test case, while `e` will be the set of unique elements from that list.
