Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is `N + 1`.
   - `s` is `N`.
   - `num` is equal to `nums[N]`.
   - `arr` contains tuples starting from (2, 0, `nums[0]`), followed by (1, 1, `nums[0]`), and ending with a tuple (1 + `s`, `N`, `nums[N]`).
   - `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one.
   - The value of `ppp` is 23.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(nums)
   ```

Given the information about `arr`, let's determine the structure of `nums`:
- The last tuple in `arr` is (1 + `s`, `N`, `nums[N]`).
- Since `s` is `N`, the last tuple is (1 + `N`, `N`, `nums[N]`).

From this, we can infer that `nums` must have at least `N + 1` elements because the last tuple references `nums[N]`.

However, the print statement is `print(nums)`, which will print the entire `nums` list. Given the information provided, we know the last element of `nums` is `nums[N]`, but we do not have any explicit values for the other elements of `nums`.

Therefore, the output will be the list `nums` itself, which includes `nums[0]`, `nums[1]`, ..., `nums[N]`.

Output: **[nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[N]]**
