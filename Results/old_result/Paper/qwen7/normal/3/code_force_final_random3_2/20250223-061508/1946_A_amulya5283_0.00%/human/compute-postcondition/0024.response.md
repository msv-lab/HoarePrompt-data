Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `operations` is 3
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`
   - `arr` is a sorted version of the second element of `test_cases[i]`
   - `median_index` is `n // 2`
   - `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`
   - `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr` with the smallest element being `smallest + 3`
   - `smallest` is decreased by 1
   - `heap` now contains `smallest + 3`

3. **Determine the changes for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `t` must still be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it becomes 1.
   - `t` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `operations` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `t` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`operations` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is a sorted version of the second element of `test_cases[1]`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr` with the smallest element being `smallest + 3`, `smallest` is decreased by 1, and `heap` now contains `smallest + 3`**
