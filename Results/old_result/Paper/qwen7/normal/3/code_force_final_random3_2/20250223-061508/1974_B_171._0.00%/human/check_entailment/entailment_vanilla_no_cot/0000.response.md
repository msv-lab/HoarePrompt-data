Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to decode the encoded string but does not correctly implement the decoding logic. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly create the reverse mapping of characters from the auxiliary string `r`. Instead, it tries to map each character in the encoded string to the next available character in alphabetical order, which is not what is required.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline

if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        
        # Step 1: Construct the auxiliary string r
        r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
        
        # Step 2: Create a mapping from r to its symmetric character
        mapping = {char: r[-i-1] for i, char in enumerate(r)}
        
        # Step 3: Decode the encoded string using the mapping
        decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
        
        print(decoded)
```

This corrected program first constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting and removing duplicates from the encoded string. Then, it creates a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character. Finally, it decodes the encoded string using this mapping.
