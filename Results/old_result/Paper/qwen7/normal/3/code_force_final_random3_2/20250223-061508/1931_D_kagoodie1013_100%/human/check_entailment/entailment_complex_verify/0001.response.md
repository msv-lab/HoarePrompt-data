### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key steps and logic of the program. Let's break down the program and verify each part:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into tokens. This is correct and efficient for handling large inputs.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it extracts the values of \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \). This is straightforward and correct.

3. **Finding Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The program uses a dictionary (`residue_map`) to keep track of the residues of each element modulo \( x \) and \( y \). This is a clever and efficient way to solve the problem.
   - For each element in the array, it calculates the required residues and uses these to find pairs that satisfy the conditions.
   - Specifically, for each element, it checks if there exists another element with the same residues modulo \( x \) and \( y \). This is correct because it ensures that both conditions \( a_i + a_j \) is divisible by \( x \) and \( a_i - a_j \) is divisible by \( y \) are met.

4. **Counting Pairs**:
   - The count of such pairs is accumulated in the variable `count`. This is done correctly by checking the frequency of the residues in the dictionary.
   - The final count for each test case is appended to the `results` list. This is correct and ensures that the result is returned as expected.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Residue Calculation**:
   - The calculation of residues `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y` ensures that we correctly handle negative numbers and find the correct residues. This is correct because `-num % x` effectively computes the positive remainder when \(-num\) is divided by \(x\).

2. **Dictionary Usage**:
   - The use of a dictionary to store and count occurrences of residues is efficient and correct. The key `(r_x, r_y)` uniquely identifies each combination of residues, ensuring accurate counting of pairs.

3. **Pair Counting Logic**:
   - The logic for counting pairs is sound. For each element, it checks if there exists another element with the same residues, which directly translates to the problem's requirements. This is correct and ensures that all beautiful pairs are counted.

### Conclusion

After re-analyzing the program, it is clear that the logic and implementation are correct according to the problem statement. The program correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
