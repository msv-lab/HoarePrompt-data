Output State: **`total` is determined by the summation of either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each iteration of `v` in the range from `na_frente` to -1, inclusive, `best` remains unchanged, `cases` remains unchanged, `pos_final` remains unchanged, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, `custo_pra_passar_b` remains unchanged, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `na_frente` and `pos_final`. However, since the initial values of these variables are defined in terms of the summation of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each iteration of `v`, and no new summation is performed, the initial state for `total` remains unchanged. All other variables remain unchanged as well.
