Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - The variable `j` is initialized to `n`.
   - The variable `n` remains as an input integer.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will iterate from `j = n` to `j < n + 1`.

4. **Check the First Iteration**: For the loop to execute at least once, `j` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `j` starts as `n`, the first iteration will occur if `n` is at least 0 (because `n < n + 1`).

5. **Adjust the States**: Based on the above analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`. Specifically, `j` should be set to `n`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`j` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0**
