Postcondition: `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then:
- If the first element of `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, the first element of `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the length of `a` is less than `x + 3`.

Otherwise (`x` is not equal to `k - 1`):
- `i` will be equal to `x`, `x` remains greater than `k - 1` and at least 2, and `z` will be `2^x - 1`.
- If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is less than `z`.
