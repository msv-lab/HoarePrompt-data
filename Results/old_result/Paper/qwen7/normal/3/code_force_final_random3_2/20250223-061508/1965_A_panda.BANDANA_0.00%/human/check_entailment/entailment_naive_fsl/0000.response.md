Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the smallest nonempty pile has more than one stone but no pile has exactly one stone. For example, consider the input:

```
3
2 2 2
```

In this case, Alice can choose \( k = 2 \) and remove 2 stones from each pile, making all piles empty. Therefore, Alice wins. However, the program incorrectly prints "Bob" because it only checks if 1 is in the list, which is not sufficient to determine the winner according to the game rules.
