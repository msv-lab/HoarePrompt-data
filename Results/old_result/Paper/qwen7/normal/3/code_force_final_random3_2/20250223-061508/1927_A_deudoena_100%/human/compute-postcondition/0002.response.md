Output State: **`ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10 and `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B'; `s` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` assigns the input value to the variable `s`. All other variables (`ma`, `mi`, `t`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The string `s` now holds the input value provided by the user.
