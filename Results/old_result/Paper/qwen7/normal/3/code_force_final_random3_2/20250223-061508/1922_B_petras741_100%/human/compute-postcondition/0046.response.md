Output State: **`res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`, `eta[j]` is unchanged, `q` is unchanged.**

This means that the value of `res` has been updated by adding the expression `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` to its current value. The variables `eta[j]` and `q` remain unchanged from their previous states.
