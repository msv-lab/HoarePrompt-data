Output State: **`custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from a new input split by spaces, `best` remains unchanged, `cases` remains unchanged, `pos_final` remains unchanged, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an input integer decreased by 1, `pos_final` is an input integer.**

The variable `na_frente` is decremented by 1, making it one less than its original value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
