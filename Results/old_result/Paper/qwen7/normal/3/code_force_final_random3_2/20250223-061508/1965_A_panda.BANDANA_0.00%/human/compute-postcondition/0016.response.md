Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `e` is a set containing unique elements from the list `l`, `m` is the length of the list `l`, `n` is an input integer, the input string is split into a list of integers which is assigned to `l`.**

The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `l`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `e`, `m`, and the original `n` remain unchanged.
