Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user**.

The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into integers, assigning them to `n` and `m` respectively. The initial state of no specific state needing adjustment for the loop to execute one more time is maintained, and the precondition that the loop will wait for the next input from the user remains valid.
