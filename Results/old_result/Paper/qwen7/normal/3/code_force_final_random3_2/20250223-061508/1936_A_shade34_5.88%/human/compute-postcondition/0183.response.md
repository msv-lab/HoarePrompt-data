Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 3, `pans` is a list of length `n`, `mak` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the input is '<' or not, and `k` is `k-2`.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not modify any variables or their values. It only ensures that all previously written output is flushed (sent to the standard output). Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
