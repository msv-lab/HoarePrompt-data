Output State: The array `arr` will be filled with values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` starting from index `left`. The list `cliquess` will be updated such that each element from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` will be set to the value of `clique`. All other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`) will remain unchanged.

In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations, the elements of `arr` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` will be filled with consecutive integers starting from `small_element`, and the corresponding elements in `cliquess` will all be set to `clique`. The rest of the array and the lists will retain their initial or unchanged states.
