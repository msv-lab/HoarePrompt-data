### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated code to determine its correctness.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend will come to the party if both the friend and their best friend receive an invitation.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of friends) and the list `p` where `p[i]` is the best friend of the `i`-th friend.
   - It then constructs a list `v` where `v[i]` is the best friend of the `i`-th friend.
   - The program checks if there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such an index is found, it means there is a pair of friends who can come to the party together, and the program prints `2`.
   - If no such index exists, the program prints `3`.

3. **Annotated Code Evaluation:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic of the function `func_1`.
   - The function handles the case where `n == 2` separately and prints `2` immediately.
   - For `n > 2`, it checks if there is any pair of friends who can come to the party together. If such a pair is found, it prints `2`. Otherwise, it prints `3`.

4. **Original Assessment Re-evaluation:**
   - The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where no pair of friends can come to the party together, specifically mentioning the input `3\n2 3 1`.
   - Let's verify this:
     - For `n = 3` and `p = [2, 3, 1]`, the best friend list `v` would be `[2, 3, 1]`.
     - Checking `v[v[v[1]]] == 1` gives `v[v[2]] == v[3] == 1`, which is true.
     - Therefore, the program should print `2` for this case, and it does.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The annotated code and the logic of the program are consistent with the problem statement.
   - The program correctly identifies when a pair of friends can come to the party together and prints `2` in those cases.
   - The program also correctly prints `3` when no such pair exists.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.
