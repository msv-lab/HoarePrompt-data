Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of length 30, `flag` is 0.**

The code simply initializes the variable `flag` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `nalla`, `x`, or `s`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
