Reasoning:
The provided program does not match the requirements of the problem. The main issue is that it uses a default value for the `defaultdict` but does not define what this default value is. Additionally, the logic to calculate the minimum number of problems needed to be created is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that each difficulty level needs to be sufficient for `m` rounds without properly accounting for the distribution of existing problems.

Given the execution summary, the function `func_1()` always returns 0, which means the program is not correctly implementing the logic to solve the problem. Instead, it is simply returning 0 for every test case.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
