Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is an integer read from the standard input, `k` is either 0 or greater than 0, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is 0, and `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` after each iteration, which will have 60 elements.**

Explanation: The line `rep = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `rep`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
