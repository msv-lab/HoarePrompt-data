Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1)`. The variable `c` is being iterated over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is 'b'. This means that the loop has already processed the character 'a' and is currently processing 'b'.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `c` is within the range `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`. Since `c` is currently 'b' (which is within the range), the loop will continue unless a break condition is met.

4. **Check the break condition**: The break condition is `if chr(c) is not in mapping.values()`. However, since we don't have information about the `mapping` dictionary, we cannot determine if this condition will be met. But based on the current state, we know that the loop will continue unless the break condition is explicitly triggered.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: Since `c` is 'b' and it is within the range, the next value of `c` will be 'c'. Therefore, we need to update the state to reflect this.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`c` is 'c'**
