Output State: **`total` is 0, `cases` must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is `na_frente` - 1, `pos_final` is `pos_final` - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from another input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `total` to 0. All other variables retain their initial conditions as described in the initial state.
