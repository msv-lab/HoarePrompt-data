Output State: **`preb` is 0, `pres` is 0**

Explanation: The code initializes `preb` to 0 and `pres` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `vis[ps - 1]` is set to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is now the final value reached when `vis[pb - 1] == 1`, `ps` is updated to the final value of `ps` when the loop breaks, `curr` is `pres + paths[length_of_paths] * (k - length_of_paths)` evaluated at the last iteration, `ress` is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `[a[pb - 1], a[pb - 1], ...]` (where the number of elements is determined by how many times the loop executed until `vis[pb - 1] == 1`), and `paths` is a list containing all the elements added during the loop iterations, `resb` and `ress` are both set to 0. After executing the given code, the only changes are that `preb` is 0 and `pres` is 0.
