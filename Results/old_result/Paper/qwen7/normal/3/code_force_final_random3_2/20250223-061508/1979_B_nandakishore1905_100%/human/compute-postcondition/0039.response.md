Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is "0", `p` is 1, and `q` is 2.**

The code updates the value of `k` to be the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
