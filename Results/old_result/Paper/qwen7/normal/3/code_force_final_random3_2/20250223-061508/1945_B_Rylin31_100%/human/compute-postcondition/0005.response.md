Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is converted from the first input integer, `b` is converted from the second input integer, `m` is converted from the third input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated according to the input. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged, and `i` is still 2. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are now the integers obtained from the input.
