Output State: `wins` is 10000, `i` is 9999.

Explanation: The loop runs from `win_with_swap` (which starts at 4) to `k-1` (where `k` is 10000), incrementing `win_with_swap` each time. Since `i` starts at 9999 and the loop increments `win_with_swap` without changing `i`, `i` remains 9999 throughout the loop. The loop will continue to run until `win_with_swap` reaches `k-1`, which is 9999 in this case. Given that the loop increments `win_with_swap` 9996 times (from 4 to 10000), it will execute exactly 9996 times. Therefore, `wins` will be 10000 after the loop completes all its iterations, and `i` will still be 9999.
