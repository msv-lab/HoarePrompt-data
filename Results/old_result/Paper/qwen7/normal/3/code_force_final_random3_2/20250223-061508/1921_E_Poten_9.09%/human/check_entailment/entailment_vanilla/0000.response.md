Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input and Setting Up:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It correctly initializes the test cases and splits the input into individual variables for each test case.

2. **Initial Conditions Check:**
   - The program checks if Alice's position (`x_a`) is greater than Bob's position (`x_b`) or if Alice is already in the last row (`x_a == h`).
   - If either condition is true, it directly appends "Draw" to the answers list. This part is correct because if Alice is in the last row, she cannot move further down, and if Alice's position is greater than Bob's, Bob cannot catch Alice.

3. **Parity Check:**
   - The program checks the parity (even or odd) of Alice's and Bob's positions.
   - If both positions have the same parity, it further checks the relative positions of Alice and Bob.
   - If Alice is to the left of Bob, it checks the distance between them and whether Alice can move to Bob's position before Bob can reach Alice.
   - If Alice is to the right of Bob, similar checks are performed.
   - If Alice and Bob have different parities, it directly assigns "Alice" as the winner. This is correct because Alice can always force a win by moving diagonally when the parities differ.

4. **Detailed Checks for Specific Cases:**
   - The program handles specific cases where Alice and Bob are close to each other and checks if Alice can force a win or if the game results in a draw.
   - These checks involve comparing distances and ensuring that Alice can always move to Bob's position before Bob can reach Alice, considering the constraints of the board.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the outcomes are determined accurately based on the given rules. The program does not contain any logical errors or omissions that would lead to incorrect results.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
