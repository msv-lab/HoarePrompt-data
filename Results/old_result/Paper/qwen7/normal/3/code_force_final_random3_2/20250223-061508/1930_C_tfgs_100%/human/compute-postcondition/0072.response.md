Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(cnt):`. The only variable mentioned here is `cnt`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `cnt` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` must be greater than 0.
   - `ans` is a list where the last element is decreased by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues if `cnt` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must still be greater than 0.
   - The state of `ans` does not change based on the loop head, so it remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `cnt`, which must remain greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cnt` must be greater than 0; `ans` is a list where the last element is decreased by 1**.
