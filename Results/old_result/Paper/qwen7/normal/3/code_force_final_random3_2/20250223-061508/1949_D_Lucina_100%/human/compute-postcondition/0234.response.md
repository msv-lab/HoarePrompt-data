Postcondition: `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `i` is an index within the bounds of `xx`, and `j - 1` is an index within the bounds of `xx[i]`; `nx` is either 'F' or 'S' depending on whether `i` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`. If either `i` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S' added to the previous value of `nx`.
