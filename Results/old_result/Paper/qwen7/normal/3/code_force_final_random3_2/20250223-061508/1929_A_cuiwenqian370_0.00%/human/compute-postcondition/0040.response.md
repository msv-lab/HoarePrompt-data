Output State: `max_beauty` is increased by the sum of absolute differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `new_arr`, `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to the length of `new_arr`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `max_beauty` will hold the total sum of the absolute differences between every pair of adjacent elements in the `new_arr` list. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. Additionally, the length of `new_arr` should be at least `n` to ensure the loop runs fully.
