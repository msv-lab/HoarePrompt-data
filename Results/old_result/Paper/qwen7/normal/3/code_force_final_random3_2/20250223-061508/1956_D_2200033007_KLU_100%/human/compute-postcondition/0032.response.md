Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head defines the variables `j` and the range `start_index` to `start_index + i + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - `j` is initialized to `i` (as stated in the problem).
   - The range `start_index` to `start_index + i + 1` must be valid and non-empty.

3. **Check the given conditions**:
   - `is_already_stairs` remains True (this is not relevant to the loop execution).
   - `j` equals `i` (initial value of `j`).
   - The value of `i` is not equal to 0 (ensures the range is not empty).
   - `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i` (not directly relevant to the loop execution).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` is initialized to `i`, this condition is already satisfied.
   - `i` should be greater than 0 to ensure the range is non-empty.
   - `start_index` and `i` define the range, and since `i` is not 0, the range is valid.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and the range defined by `start_index` and `i`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` must be greater than 0, `start_index` and `i` define a valid range**
