Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `left` is `S[0][0]`
   - `lsum` is `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`
   - `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`
   - `ans` is 0

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop head only involves `i`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

5. **New State After Incrementing `i`:**
   - `i` will become 1.

6. **Other States Remain Unchanged:**
   - `left`, `lsum`, `rsum`, and `ans` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless the loop body changes them, but since no loop body is given, these states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `left` is `S[0][0]`, `lsum` is `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`, and `ans` is 0**
