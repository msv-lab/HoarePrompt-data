Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 2, `adv` is `min(a[1] - a[2] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `ans` contains `a[1] - 2`, `ans` now also contains `a[2] - 1 - 1`, `ans` now also contains `a[1] - 2 - 1`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 2, `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]`. So, `a[1] - j - 1` becomes `a[1] - 2 - 1`. Since `ans` already contains `a[1] - 2` and `a[2] - 1 - 1`, it now also contains `a[1] - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
