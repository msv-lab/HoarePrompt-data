The only variable in the loop head is the condition itself, which is `True` for a `while True` loop. Since the loop will always execute as long as it is not explicitly broken out of, no adjustments are necessary to the given states.

However, to ensure the loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the loop's exit condition (if any) is not met within the loop body. In this case, the loop exits if `vis[pb - 1] == 1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `vis[pb - 1]` remains 0 so that the loop continues.

Given the states at the end of the previous iteration, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `vis[pb - 1]` to remain 0.

State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `MOD` is 1000000007, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original `n` string to an integer, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original `k` string to an integer, `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original `ps` string to an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting another input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, and `vis[pb - 1]` must remain 0**
