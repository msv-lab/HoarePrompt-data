Postcondition: `tmp` is a list of integers, `i` is the next element in `tmp` (if it exists), and `y` is either decreased by `i - 1` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, or remains unchanged. Additionally, `ans` is increased by `i` if the condition `y >= i - 1` is true; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
