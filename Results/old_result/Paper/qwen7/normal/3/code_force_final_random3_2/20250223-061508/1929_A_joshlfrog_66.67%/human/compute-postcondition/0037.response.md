Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `i` is `l-1`, `x` is 0, `y` is 100000000, and `nums` is a list of integers created by splitting the input string.**

The code sets `y` to 100000000. This does not affect the values of `t`, `e`, `l`, `i`, `x`, or `nums`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
