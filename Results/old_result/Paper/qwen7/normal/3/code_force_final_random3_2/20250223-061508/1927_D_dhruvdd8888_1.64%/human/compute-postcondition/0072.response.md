Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `eli` is the result of `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`. This function returns the position in the sorted list `arr` where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` should be inserted to maintain order. Since `arr` starts with tuples like `(2, 0, nums[0])`, `(1, 1, nums[0])`, and ends with `(1 + s, N, nums[N])`, the position of `(l, 0, 0)` depends on the value of `l`.
   - `N` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is `N + 1`.
   - `s` is `N`.
   - `num` is `nums[N]`.
   - `arr` contains tuples starting from `(2, 0, nums[0])`, followed by `(1, 1, nums[0])`, and ending with `(1 + s, N, nums[N])`.
   - `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one.
   - `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting it to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s - 1, s)
   ```

Given this, let's determine the values of `s - 1` and `s`:

- `s` is explicitly defined as `N`.
- Therefore, `s - 1` is `N - 1`.

So, the print statement will output `N - 1` followed by `N`.

Output: **N - 1 N**
