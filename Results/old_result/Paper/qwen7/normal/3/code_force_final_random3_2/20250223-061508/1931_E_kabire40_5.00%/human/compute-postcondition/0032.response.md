Output State: **`x` is 1, `rev_res` is `rev_res` + `val_in` reversed.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res += val_in[::-1]` takes the value of `val_in` (which is the element at index 1 in `rev_val`), reverses it (`val_in[::-1]`), and adds it to `rev_res`. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, `x` is still 1, and `rev_res` is updated to include the reversed version of `val_in`.
