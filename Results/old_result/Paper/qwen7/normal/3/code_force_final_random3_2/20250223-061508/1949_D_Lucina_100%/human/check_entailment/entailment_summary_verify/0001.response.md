### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires generating a complete transition video plan such that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type (`F` or `S`) appear for any permutation of scenarios.
   - The input consists of an \( n \times n \) matrix where each cell represents the transition video between two scenarios. The matrix is symmetric, and some cells are undecided (`?`).

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The function `func()` reads the input and initializes some lists and variables.
   - It counts the number of `F` and `S` transitions for each scenario.
   - It separates the scenarios into two lists (`sa` and `sb`) based on the count of `F` and `S`.
   - Depending on the sizes of `sa` and `sb`, it decides how to assign `F` or `S` to the undecided transitions (`?`).

3. **Key Issues in the Code:**
   - **Incorrect Handling of Undecided Transitions:**
     - The code attempts to assign `F` or `S` to undecided transitions based on the size of `sa` and `sb`. However, this logic is flawed because it does not consider the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.
   - **Incorrect Logic for Assigning Values:**
     - The code tries to assign `F` or `S` to undecided transitions based on whether the scenario is in the first \(\frac{n}{4} - 1\) positions of `sa` or `sb`. This logic is overly simplistic and does not guarantee the required constraint.
   - **Lack of Consideration for All Permutations:**
     - The code does not ensure that the solution works for all possible permutations of scenarios, which is a critical requirement.

4. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function summary states that the function calculates the cumulative counts of `F` and `S` characters across all input strings and then generates a new set of transition video plans based on these counts. If the count of `F` is greater than or equal to the count of `S`, it fills in `?` with `F`; otherwise, it fills in `?` with `S`.
   - This summary is misleading because it does not reflect the actual logic used in the code, which is flawed and does not ensure the required constraint.

5. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the first example, the code fails to produce a valid solution. The output does not satisfy the constraint of no more than 4 consecutive `F` or `S` videos.
   - For the second example, the code also fails to produce a valid solution. The output does not satisfy the constraint for certain permutations of scenarios.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type appear for any permutation of scenarios. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness:** False

Final: **False**
