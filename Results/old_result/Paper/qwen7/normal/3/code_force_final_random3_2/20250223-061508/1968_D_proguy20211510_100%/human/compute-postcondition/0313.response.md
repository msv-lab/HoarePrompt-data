Output State: **`resb` is the maximum value obtained from the loop's iterations, `ress` is `paths[2] * k`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` plus the last computed `pathb[i]`, `pres` is `paths[1] * k + paths[i]`, `i` is 4, `curr` is `paths[1] * k + paths[2] * (k - 3)`**

Explanation: The line `pres += paths[i]` increments `pres` by the value of `paths[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 3, after executing this line, `i` is incremented to 4. Therefore, `pres` is updated to `paths[1] * k + paths[i]`, which is `paths[1] * k + paths[4]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
