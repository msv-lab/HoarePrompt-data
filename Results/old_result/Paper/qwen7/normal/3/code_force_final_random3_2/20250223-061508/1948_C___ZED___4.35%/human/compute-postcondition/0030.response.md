Output: **1**

Explanation: According to the initial state, `k` is explicitly given as 1. Since there is no other information provided about `n` besides it being greater than 1, we do not need to include `n` in the output as it is not referenced in the print statement. Therefore, the print statement will simply output the value of `k`, which is 1.
