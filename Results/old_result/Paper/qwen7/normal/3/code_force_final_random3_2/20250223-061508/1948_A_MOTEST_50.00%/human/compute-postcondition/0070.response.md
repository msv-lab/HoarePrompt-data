Output State: `ans` is increased by `s[x] * 2` for each iteration of the loop, `x` is increased by 2 for each iteration, `n` is at least 2, and `j` is less than `n // 2 - 1` until the loop finishes all iterations.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will have been incremented by `s[x] * 2` for every iteration, `x` will have been increased by 2 for each iteration, `n` will still be at least 2, and `j` will be less than `n // 2 - 1` when the loop ends.
