State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` must be 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains two variables: `i` and `t`.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a valid value that allows the loop to run at least once. Since `t` is the upper limit of the range function, it must be at least 1.
3. The variable `i` starts at 0 when the loop begins.
4. Therefore, the state before the loop should reflect that `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive), and `i` is 0.

Thus, the state to be adjusted is: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` must be 0**.
