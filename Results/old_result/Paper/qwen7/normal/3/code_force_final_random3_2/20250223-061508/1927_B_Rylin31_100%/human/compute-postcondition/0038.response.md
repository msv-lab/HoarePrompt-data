Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in array:`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `array`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is not explicitly defined in the given state before the loop starts, but it will take values from the `array`.
   - `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `array`. For the loop to execute, `array` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop will iterate over `array`, `array` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. The other variables (`ans`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `s`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `array` must contain at least one element.

**State:**
**`array` must contain at least one element**
