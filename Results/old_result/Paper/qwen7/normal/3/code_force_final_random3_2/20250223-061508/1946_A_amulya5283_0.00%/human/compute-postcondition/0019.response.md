Output State: **`operations` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is a sorted version of the second element of `test_cases[i]`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr` with the smallest element being `smallest + 1`, `smallest` is the previous smallest element popped from the heap, `smallest` is decreased by 1, and `heap` now contains `smallest + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value `smallest + 1` into the heap.
- Since `smallest` was previously the smallest element popped from the heap and was then decreased by 1, the new value of `smallest` is now one less than its previous value.
- Therefore, `smallest + 1` is the new smallest element being pushed into the heap.
