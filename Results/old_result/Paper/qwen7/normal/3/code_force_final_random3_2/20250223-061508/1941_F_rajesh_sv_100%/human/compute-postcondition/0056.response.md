Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `l < h`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `l` is less than `h`.

2. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `l` and `h`.

3. **Determine the Current Values**:
   - `mid` is updated based on the comparison between `mid_sum - left` and `right - mid_next_sum`.
   - If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `mid` is updated to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `mid` remains as `l + (h - l) // 2` with `h` updated to `mid`.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, the condition `l < h` must still hold true.
   - If `mid` is updated to `mid + 1`, then `l` will be incremented, and `h` will remain the same. This could potentially change the relationship between `l` and `h`.
   - If `mid` remains as `l + (h - l) // 2` and `h` is updated to `mid`, then `h` will be set to the new value of `mid`, and `l` will remain the same.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `l < h` holds true.
   - Given the possible updates to `mid`, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where `mid` is updated to `mid + 1` and `l` is incremented while `h` remains the same.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `h` must be greater than `l + 1` to ensure the loop can execute again.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mid` is updated to either `mid + 1` or `l + (h - l) // 2`, depending on the condition; if `mid` is updated to `mid + 1`, then `l` is incremented, and `h` remains the same; to ensure the loop can execute again, `h` must be greater than `l + 1`**.
