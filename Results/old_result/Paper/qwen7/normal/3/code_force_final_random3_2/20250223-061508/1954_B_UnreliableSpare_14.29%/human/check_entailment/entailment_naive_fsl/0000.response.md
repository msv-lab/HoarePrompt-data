Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to consider the requirement of removing elements to make the array stop being beautiful. Instead, it checks if the array is already beautiful and prints `-1` if it is, which is not the intended behavior.

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

The expected output is `1`, as explained in the example. However, the program incorrectly outputs `-1` because it checks if the array is already beautiful and prints `-1` without considering the possibility of removing elements to make the array stop being beautiful.

To fix this, the program needs to identify positions where the condition `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}` holds and calculate the minimum number of elements to remove to break this condition.
