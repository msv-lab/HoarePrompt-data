Output State: **`operations` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is a sorted version of the second element of `test_cases[i]`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr`, `heap[0]` is now the smallest element popped from the heap, `smallest` is the smallest element popped from the heap, `heap` now contains the smallest element (previously `heap[0]`) with a new value of `smallest + 1`, `smallest + 1` is less than or equal to `current_median`, `smallest` is the previous smallest element popped from the heap, `smallest` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to `smallest`. Since `smallest + 1` was previously less than or equal to `current_median`, and `smallest` is now the smallest element popped from the heap, `smallest` is effectively decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
