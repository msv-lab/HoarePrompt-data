Output State: **`cases` is an input integer, and all other variables are not yet defined.**

The code `cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `cases`. Since the input for `cases` is not specified in the initial state, it remains as an input integer. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`) are not yet defined and retain their initial state descriptions.
