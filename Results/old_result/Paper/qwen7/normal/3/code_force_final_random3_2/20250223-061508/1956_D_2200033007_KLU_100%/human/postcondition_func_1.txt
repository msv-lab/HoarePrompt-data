The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `start_index` and `end_index`, representing the indices of a sublist in a list `arr` of non-negative integers. It aims to find a specific configuration of sublists based on certain conditions and returns a list of tuples representing these configurations. If no valid configuration is found, it returns an empty list.
