Postcondition: **`count2` is either 0 or equal to `count`, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the new input string, `n` must be at least 1, `done` is True, `x` is the first character of the new input string, `j` is 1, the first element of `s` is now the first character of `string`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `s[j]` is equal to `x`.**

This postcondition summarizes both cases: if `count > 1`, then `count2` remains as `count`; otherwise, `count2` becomes 0. All other conditions remain unchanged.
