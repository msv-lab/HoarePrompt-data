Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t` which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each testcase, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000. The total length of all strings `s` does not exceed 5000. The function does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code snippet.**
