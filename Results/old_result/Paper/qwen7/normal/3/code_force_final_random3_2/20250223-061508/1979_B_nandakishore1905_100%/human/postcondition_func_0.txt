The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two distinct non-negative integers `n` and `m`. It calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m` for each test case. Depending on the value of `k`, it prints one of three possible values: `k` itself if it is a power of 2, 1 if `k` is odd, or 0 if `k` is even and not a power of 2. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
