Postcondition: **`minn` is either `maxx` + 1 or equal to the current value of `maxx`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `mex` is a list containing 0 if the condition `arr[i] > 0` is true, otherwise `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between each element in `arr` and `minn`, and `maxx` is updated to the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` if `abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx`. Otherwise, `maxx` remains unchanged.**
