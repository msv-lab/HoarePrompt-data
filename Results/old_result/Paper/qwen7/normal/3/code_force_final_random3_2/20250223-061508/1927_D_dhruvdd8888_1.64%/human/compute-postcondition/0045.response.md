Based on the initial state provided:

- `N` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `N + 1`.
- `s` is `N`.
- `num` is equal to `nums[N]`.
- `arr` contains tuples starting from (2, 0, `nums[0]`), followed by (1, 1, `nums[0]`), and ending with a tuple (1 + `s`, `N`, `nums[N]`).
- `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one.
- `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting it to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
- `eli` is the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`.
- `s` is updated to the value of `arr[min(eli, LA)][0]`.
- `e` is updated to the value of `arr[min(eli, LA)][1]`.
- `_` is updated to the value of `arr[min(eli, LA)][2]`.
- The current value of `s` is 1.

The `print(-1, -1)` statement will print the literal values `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
