Output State: **`j` is 0 or 1; `lex` is a value between 2 and 26; `arr` is a list containing the element 26.**

Explanation: The variable `lex` is decreased by 26. Since `lex` was initially greater than 26 and less than 52, subtracting 26 from it results in a value between 2 and 26. The values of `j` and the list `arr` remain unchanged.
