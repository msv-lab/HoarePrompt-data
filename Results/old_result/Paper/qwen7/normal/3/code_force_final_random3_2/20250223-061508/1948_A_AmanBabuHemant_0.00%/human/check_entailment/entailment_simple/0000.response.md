### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Special Character Count**: The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly `n` special characters in a string where each special character must have exactly one neighbor that is different. This logic is correct.

3. **String Construction**: For even `n`, the program constructs a string `s` using the pattern "110" repeated `n // 2` times. Each "110" segment ensures that the middle character ('0') is a special character, and the neighboring '1's are not special. This pattern guarantees that exactly half of the characters in the constructed string will be special. Since `n` is even, `n // 2` will be an integer, and the constructed string will have exactly `n` special characters.

4. **Length Check**: The program checks if the constructed string `s` has a length less than 200. If it does, it prints "YES" followed by the constructed string. Otherwise, it prints "NO". Given that `n` is at most 50, the length of the constructed string will always be within the limit of 200.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all specified edge cases correctly:
   - When `n` is odd, it correctly prints "NO".
   - When `n` is even, it constructs a valid string with exactly `n` special characters and prints "YES" followed by the string.

### Conclusion:

The program logic is sound and correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:

**True**
