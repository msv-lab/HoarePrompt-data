Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `MOD` is 1000000007, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original `n` string to an integer, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original `k` string to an integer, `pb` is an integer obtained from converting the original `pb` string to an integer, `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original `ps` string to an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`**.

This means that the input string is split and each element is converted to an integer, forming a list `p`. The values of `t`, `MOD`, `alpha`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged from their initial states.
