Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white so that all cells become white. This means we need to find the longest segment of consecutive black cells and paint it white to ensure all remaining black cells are also painted.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` is supposed to find the minimum length of a segment to paint white.
   - However, the current implementation does not correctly identify the longest segment of consecutive black cells.
   - Instead, it calculates the distance between the first and last black cells in the string and adds 2, which is incorrect.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - We should iterate through the string to find the longest segment of consecutive black cells.
   - Keep track of the start and end indices of the longest segment of black cells.
   - The length of this segment is the answer.

4. **Current Implementation Issues**:
   - The function uses two separate loops to find the first and last black cells but does not handle the longest segment correctly.
   - The calculation `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect because it does not account for the longest segment of consecutive black cells.

Given the above analysis, the current implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
