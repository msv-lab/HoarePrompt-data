Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `arr` is a list of tuples. It starts with `(2, 0, nums[0])`, followed by `(1, 1, nums[0])`, and ends with `(1 + s, N, nums[N])`.
   - `eli` is the result of `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`. This means `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to keep `arr` sorted.
   - `N` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is `N + 1`.
   - `s` is `N`.
   - `num` is `nums[N]`.
   - `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one.
   - `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting it to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   ```python
   print(s, e + 1)
   ```
   - `s` is `N`.
   - `e` is part of the tuple at the index determined by `min(eli, LA)`. Since `s` and `e` are assigned from this tuple, and `s` is `N`, we need to determine `e`.

Given the structure of `arr`, let's consider the possible values:
- If `l` is less than or equal to `nums[0]`, then `eli` will be `0` because `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted before `(2, 0, nums[0])`.
- If `l` is greater than `nums[0]` but less than or equal to `nums[N]`, then `eli` will be `N + 1` because `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted after the last tuple `(1 + s, N, nums[N])`.

Since `s` is `N`, and assuming `l` is such that `eli` is `N + 1` (the most general case):
- The tuple at index `N + 1` is `(1 + N, N, nums[N])`.
- Therefore, `e` will be `N`.

Thus, the print statement will output `N` and `N + 1`.

Output: **N N + 1**
