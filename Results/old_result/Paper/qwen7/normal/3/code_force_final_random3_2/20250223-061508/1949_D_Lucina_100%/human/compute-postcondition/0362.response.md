Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 3, `j` is 2, `nx` is 'xS' or 'FS' or 'SF'**.

Explanation: The variable `nx` is concatenated with the string `'S'`. Since `nx` was either `'x'`, `'S'`, or `'F'`, after concatenation, `nx` becomes `'xS'`, `'FS'`, or `'SF'`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
