Based on the initial state provided, `answers` is described as a non-empty list. However, no specific values or further details about the contents of the list are given. Since the list is non-empty, it contains at least one element, but we do not know the exact value of the element that would be accessed by `answer`.

Given this information, we cannot determine the exact value that will be printed without additional context. Therefore, the most precise description we can provide is that `answer` refers to an element from the non-empty list `answers`.

Output: **an element from the non-empty list answers**
