Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `while l < h:`.
   - The variables involved in the loop condition are `l` and `h`.

2. **Current States:**
   - `l` is the index of the smallest item in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`.
   - `h` is the index of the largest item in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - f`.
   - `f` takes the next value from the set `F`.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `l < h`.

4. **Initial Values:**
   - We need to ensure that `l` is less than `h` for the loop to execute at least once.
   - Since `f` changes with each iteration, we don't need to adjust its state directly for the first iteration.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - We need to ensure that `l` is less than `h` initially.
   - If `l` is already less than `h`, no adjustment is needed.
   - If `l` is not less than `h`, we need to adjust the states to make `l < h`.

### Conclusion:

Given the current states, we need to ensure that `l` is less than `h` for the loop to execute the first time. Since `f` is updated with each iteration, the initial values of `l` and `h` should be such that `l < h`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure `l < h`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`l` is the index of the smallest item in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`, `h` is the index of the largest item in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - f`, and `l` must be less than `h`.**
