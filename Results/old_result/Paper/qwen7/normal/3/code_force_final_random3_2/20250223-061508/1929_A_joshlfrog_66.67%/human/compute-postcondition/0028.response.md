Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `e` is 0, `l` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `x` is equal to `nums[2]`, `y` is equal to `nums[2]`**.

The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `y`. Given that `i` is 2, `y` becomes `nums[2]`, which is the same as `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
