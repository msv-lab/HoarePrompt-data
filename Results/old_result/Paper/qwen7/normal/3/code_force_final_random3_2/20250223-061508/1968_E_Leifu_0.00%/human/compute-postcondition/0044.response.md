Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be at least 4.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

However, the value of `j` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since `j` is not mentioned in the initial state and no default value is provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `j`. Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `j`.

Output: **str(j) + ' ' + str(j) (where j is an undefined variable)**
