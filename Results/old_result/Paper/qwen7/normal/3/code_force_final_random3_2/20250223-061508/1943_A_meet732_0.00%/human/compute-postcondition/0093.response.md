Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in a:`. This means the loop variable `i` is taken from the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `i`: This variable will take values from the list `a` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `a`: This is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

3. **Understand the loop execution condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `a`. Once `a` is empty, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` will take values from `a`, we need to ensure that `a` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `i` will be the first element of `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements, each initialized to 0.

For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `a` has at least one element.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `a` must have at least one element.
- The first element of `a` will be assigned to `i` in the first iteration of the loop.

Thus, the state to be adjusted is:
State: **`a` must have at least one element, and the first element of `a` will be assigned to `i`**
