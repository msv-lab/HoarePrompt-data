Output State: **`mdx` is less than `n`, and `res` is increased by 1, `i` is `mdx + 1`, and `mdx + 1` must be less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code `res += 1` increases the value of `res` by 1. The conditions and relationships between `mdx`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `mdx` is still less than `n`, `i` is still `mdx + 1`, and `mdx + 1` must still be less than `n`.
