Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1, `i` is 3, `n` is the original input integer and is not equal to 1, `ans` is the string `s[0]` repeated `n` times, `x` is `n // 2`, and `j` is `n // 2` if `n` is even; otherwise, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus 6 times the value of `s[x]`, `x` is increased by 3, and `j` is increased by 2.
