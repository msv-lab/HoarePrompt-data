Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and we have read one line of input which contains the value of `t`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    len_a, len_b = len(a), len(b)
    count_a, count_b = 0, 0
    d = k // 2
    for i in range(max(len_a, len_b)):
        if len_a > i + 1:
            if a[i] <= k:
                count_a += 1
        if len_b > i + 1:
            if b[i] <= k:
                count_b += 1
    print('YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All elements in list `a` and `b` up to the maximum length of the two lists have been checked against the condition `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is equal to the maximum value between `len_a` and `len_b`, `count_a` is incremented by 1 for every index `i` where `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k` and `i` is less than the length of `a`, `count_b` is incremented by 1 for every index `i` where `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k` and `i` is less than the length of `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `max(len_a, len_b)`, `count_a` will be a value between 0 and `min(len_a, max(len_a, len_b))` inclusive, and `count_b` will be a value between 0 and `min(len_b, max(len_a, len_b))` inclusive. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `len_a`, `len_b`, and `d` will remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
