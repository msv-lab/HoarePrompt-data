Output State: **`max_sum` remains 0, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `y` remains 1, `gcd_val` remains 1, `current_sum` remains 2.**

Explanation: The given code does not perform any operations that would change the values of the variables. It only updates `x` to the next element in `test_cases`. The other variables (`max_sum`, `y`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
