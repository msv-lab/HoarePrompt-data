Output State: `total` is 0, `i` is 5, `nx` is either 'FFxF', 'FSxF', 'SFSx', 'SSxF', 'FFSx', 'FSSF', 'SFFx', or 'SSSx', `j` is 4, `n` is 4.

Explanation: After the loop completes all four iterations (since `n` is 4), the value of `i` will be incremented from 1 to 5. The variable `nx` will contain a string of length 4, which can be any combination of 'F', 'S', and 'x' based on the conditions inside the loop. The value of `j` will be 4 because the loop runs from 1 to `n+1`, and `n` is 4. The variable `total` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop.
