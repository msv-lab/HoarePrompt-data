Reasoning:
The problem requires finding the maximum possible beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \). The key insight here is that to maximize the beauty, we should sort the array in either ascending or descending order. This ensures that the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) are maximized.

However, the provided program does not sort the array. Instead, it simply finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and calculates their difference. This approach is incorrect because:

1. The beauty is calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
2. Sorting the array in ascending or descending order would ensure that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
3. The current implementation only computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which does not necessarily maximize the overall beauty.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
