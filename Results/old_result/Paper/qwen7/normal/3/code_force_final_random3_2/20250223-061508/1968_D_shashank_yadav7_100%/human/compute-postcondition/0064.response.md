Output State: **`k` is 1, `b` is `input integer - 1`, `s` is `input integer - 1`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `sm` is `a[s] * k`, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is now equal to `a[b]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `sp` is now equal to `a[s]`**.

Explanation: The code `sm = a[s] * k` updates the value of `sm` to be `a[s] * k`. Given that `k` is 1, this simplifies to `sm` being updated to `a[s]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
