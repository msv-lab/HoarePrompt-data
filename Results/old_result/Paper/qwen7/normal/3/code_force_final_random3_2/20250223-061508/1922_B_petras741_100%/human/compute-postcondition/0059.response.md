Output State: **`w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is a list of n+1 elements, each initialized to 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes a list `q` with `n+1` elements, all set to 0. The list `w` and the integer `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
