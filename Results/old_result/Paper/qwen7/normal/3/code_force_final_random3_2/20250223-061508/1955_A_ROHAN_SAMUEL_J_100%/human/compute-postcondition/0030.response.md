Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values of the integers entered by the user during the input.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the input operation. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are now updated to the values of the integers entered by the user, but their original constraints (i.e., `n`, `a`, and `b` being integers) are maintained.
