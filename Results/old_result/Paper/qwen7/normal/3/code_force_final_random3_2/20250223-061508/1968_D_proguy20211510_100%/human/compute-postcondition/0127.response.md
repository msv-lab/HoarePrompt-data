Postcondition: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb - 1` set to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is now the value of `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `curr` is `pres + paths[length_of_paths] * (k - length_of_paths)`, `ress` is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, and the element at index `pb - 1` of `vis` is equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `vis[pb - 1] == 1` is true or false, the state of the variables remains as described. Specifically, if the condition is true, the loop or if statement is exited, and the element at index `pb - 1` of `vis` is already set to 1. If the condition is false, the state of the variables does not change from their initial or intermediate states as described.
