Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Rectangle Dimensions**: For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.
3. **Logic Check**: The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If at least one of them is even, it prints 'Yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
4. **Edge Cases**: 
   - A \(1 \times 1\) rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles, hence it returns 'No'.
   - Rectangles like \(2 \times 1\) and \(1 \times 2\) can only result in themselves after cutting, thus returning 'No'.
   - Rectangles like \(2 \times 6\), \(3 \times 2\), \(2 \times 2\), and \(2 \times 4\) can indeed be cut and rearranged to form other rectangles, thus returning 'Yes'.

The logic in the program accurately follows the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.
