### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the array and the array elements.
   - It then calls `func_1(n, arr)` to compute the maximum beauty.
   - In `func_1`, the array is sorted and then rearranged by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements.
   - Finally, it calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - Sorting the array helps in easily pairing the smallest and largest elements.
   - Alternating between the smallest and largest elements ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
   - Summing the absolute differences between these pairs gives the maximum possible beauty.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all elements in the array are the same, sorting and rearranging will not change the beauty, which should be zero.
   - If the array has only two distinct values, the maximum beauty is the difference between these values multiplied by the number of elements minus one.

5. **Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement match the expected behavior of the solution.
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the rearrangement and calculation of the beauty.

However, upon closer inspection of the `func_1` function, we notice that the logic for rearranging the array is flawed. Specifically, the code alternates between the smallest and largest elements without ensuring that the differences are maximized in a way that would yield the highest possible beauty.

Let's consider the following example:
- Input: `n = 5`, `arr = [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
- Sorted array: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
- Rearranged array: `[43, 100, 54, 90, 80]`

The beauty calculated is:
\[ |100 - 43| + |54 - 100| + |90 - 54| + |80 - 90| = 57 + 46 + 36 + 10 = 149 \]

However, the optimal rearrangement to maximize the beauty would be:
\[ [100, 54, 90, 80, 43] \]
The beauty calculated is:
\[ |54 - 100| + |90 - 54| + |80 - 90| + |43 - 80| = 46 + 36 + 10 + 37 = 129 \]

This shows that the current implementation does not always produce the maximum possible beauty.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the provided solution does not guarantee the maximum beauty for all possible input arrays. The logic in `func_1` does not ensure that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized in the most optimal way.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
