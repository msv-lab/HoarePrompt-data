Postcondition: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least one element, `x` is the next element in the list (after reversing it and converting to integer), `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`. If the length of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is incremented by `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`.**
