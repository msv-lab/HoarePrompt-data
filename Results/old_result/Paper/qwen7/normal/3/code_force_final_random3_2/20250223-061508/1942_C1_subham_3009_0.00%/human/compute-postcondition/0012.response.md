Output State: **`t` is greater than -1, `__name__` is `__main__`, `n` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers where each element is the integer from the input corresponding to its index.**

Explanation: The code snippet converts each of the first `x` elements in the list `arr` (which are initially strings) into integers. These integers are then stored back into the list `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `__name__`, `n`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.
