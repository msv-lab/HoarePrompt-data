### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Rules**:
   - Players take turns removing a positive integer `k` from each non-empty pile, where `k` is at most the size of the smallest non-empty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., all piles are empty) loses.
   - Alice goes first.

2. **Analyzing the Functions**:
   - **func_1(a)**: This function sorts the unique elements of the list `a` and then calculates the differences between consecutive elements. However, this function does not seem to be directly related to determining the winner of the game.
   - **func_2(a, n)**: This function is intended to determine the winner based on the number of piles (`n`) and the sizes of the piles (`a`). It uses recursion to determine the winner based on the parity (odd or even) of the number of piles and the sizes of the piles.

3. **Game Analysis**:
   - For 1 pile, the player who faces an odd-sized pile loses because they can only reduce it by an even amount (since `k` is at most the size of the pile).
   - For 2 piles, if both piles are even, the second player wins. If one pile is odd and the other is even, the first player wins by reducing the odd pile to zero.
   - For more than 2 piles, the game can be reduced to the parity of the number of piles and the largest pile. If the number of piles is even, the first player can always force the second player into a losing position. If the number of piles is odd, the second player can always force the first player into a losing position.

4. **Function Implementation**:
   - **Base Cases**:
     - If `n == 1`, the player with an odd-sized pile loses.
     - If `n == 2`, the player with an even-sized pile loses.
   - **Recursive Case**:
     - If the next player can force a win (i.e., `winNext == 2`), the current player wins.
     - If the next player cannot force a win but the current pile is not 1, the current player wins.
     - Otherwise, the next player wins.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the game rules and the optimal strategy for determining the winner based on the number of piles and their sizes.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the optimal strategy.

**Correctness: True**
