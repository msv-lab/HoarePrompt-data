Output State: **`rev_val` must have at least 1 element, `x` is equal to `k + 1`, and `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[x]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value of `rev_val[x]` to `val_in`. Since `x` is already defined as `k + 1`, `val_in` will be the integer value of `rev_val[k + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
