Output State: **`v1` is `len(vx) - 4`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 2`, `vx` has one less element than before the removal, `len(vx)` must be greater than 1, `v3` is the return value of `q(0)`, and `_` is the discarded return value of `q(0)`**.

This means that `v3` has been assigned the return value of the function `q(0)`, while `_` (which is typically used for a variable that is not going to be used) has received the second return value from `q(0)`, which is discarded. The values of `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged, and the length of `vx` is reduced by one, but still greater than 1.
