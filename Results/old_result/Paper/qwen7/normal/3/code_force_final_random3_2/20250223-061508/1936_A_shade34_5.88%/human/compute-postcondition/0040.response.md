Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the initial conditions**:
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `mak` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `pans` is a list that either contains the element `n-1` or contains `i` (which is `n-1`).
   - `s` is the string input by the user.
   - `s` is either not equal to `<` or equal to `=`.

3. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop runs for each value of `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. Since `i` is currently `n-1`, the loop will not execute again because `i` is already equal to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will remain `n-1` because the loop will not execute again.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Other states**: The other states (`mak2`, `mak`, `pans`, `s`) do not change based on the loop head variables alone. They depend on the loop body, which is omitted here.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list that either contains the element `n-1` or contains `i` (which is `n-1`), `s` is the string input by the user, and `s` is either not equal to `<` or equal to `=`.**
