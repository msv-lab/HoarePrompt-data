Output State: **`total` is `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v - 1]`, `best` remains unchanged, `v` is either less than or equal to `pos_final` or greater than `pos_final`, `cases` must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is unchanged, `pos_final` is unchanged, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` updates the value of `total` by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged as per the given code snippet.
