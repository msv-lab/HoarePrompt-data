Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 48, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 48.
