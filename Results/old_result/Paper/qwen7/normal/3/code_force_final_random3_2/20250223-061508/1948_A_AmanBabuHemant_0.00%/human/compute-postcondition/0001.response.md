State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at all, `t` must be a positive integer.
3. Since `t` is given as an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `t` must be within this range for the loop to execute.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
