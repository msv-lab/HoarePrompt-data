Output State: **`trumps` now contains the value of `rank`, `answers` is the same as before, `rank` is the first element of `card`, `suit` is the second element of `card`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `rank` to the list `trumps`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `trumps` now includes the value of `rank`, while `answers`, `rank`, and `suit` retain their original values.
