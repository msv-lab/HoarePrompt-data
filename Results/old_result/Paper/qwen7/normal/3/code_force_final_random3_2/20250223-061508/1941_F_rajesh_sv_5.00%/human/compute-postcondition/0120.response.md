The loop head contains the variables `l` and `h`. The condition for the loop to continue is `l < h`. At the end of the previous iteration, the values of `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, and `mid` are given, but these do not affect the loop condition directly. Therefore, we only need to ensure that the loop condition `l < h` still holds true.

Given that the loop condition is `l < h`, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than `h`. Since no specific values for `l` and `h` are provided, we cannot assume any particular values. However, we know that if `l` is not less than `h`, the loop would terminate. Thus, we need to ensure that `l` is still less than `h`.

State: **`mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is equal to `l` + (`h` - `l`) // 2, and `l` is less than `h`.**
