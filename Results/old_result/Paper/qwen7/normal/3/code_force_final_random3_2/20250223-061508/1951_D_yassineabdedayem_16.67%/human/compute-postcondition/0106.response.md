Based on the initial state provided:

- `rep` is 60
- `n` is 0
- `k` is 0
- `Min` is 0
- `Max` is 0
- `number` is the last value appended to `tab` during the 60th iteration
- `tab` is a list containing the string representations of all `number` values from each iteration

The if condition `if k == 0:` is satisfied because `k` is 0. This implies that during the 60th iteration, `number` was appended to `tab`.

Since `tab` contains the string representations of all `number` values from each iteration, and there have been 60 iterations, `tab` will have 60 elements.

Therefore, the length of `tab` is 60.

Output: **60**
