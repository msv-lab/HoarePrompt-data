You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - Functions `func_1`, `wrapper` are defined but not used in the main logic.
   - Functions `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7` are defined but not used in the main logic either. This suggests these functions might be placeholders or helper functions not utilized in the problem-solving part.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic is contained within `func_7`.
   - `func_7` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of prepared problems (`n`), the number of models (`m`), and the number of functions (`k`).
   - It then reads the complexities of the prepared problems (`A`), the models (`D`), and the functions (`F`).
   - The function calculates the current maximum difference (`max_diff`) between consecutive elements in `A`.
   - It also calculates the next maximum difference (`next_max_diff`) to handle edge cases where the new problem could potentially reduce the next gap more than the current gap.
   - It then iterates through each function complexity `f` and uses binary search (`bisect_right`, `bisect_left`) to find the optimal insertion point in `D` to minimize the imbalance.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum possible imbalance after considering all potential new problems.

### Detailed Analysis of the Main Logic:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The input reading and processing logic seems correct and follows the problem statement.

2. **Calculating Current Imbalance**:
   - The calculation of `max_diff` and `next_max_diff` is correct. It correctly identifies the largest gaps in the sequence.

3. **Binary Search for Insertion Points**:
   - The use of `bisect_right` and `bisect_left` to find the optimal insertion points in `D` is appropriate. This ensures that the new problem complexity `d_i + f_j` is placed optimally to minimize the imbalance.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The logic handles the edge case where the new problem could potentially reduce the next gap more than the current gap by comparing the calculated differences.

5. **Output**:
   - The final output is the minimum possible imbalance, which is correctly calculated.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at most one new problem. The main logic is sound and follows the problem requirements accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
