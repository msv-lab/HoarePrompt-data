### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Given Program:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

#### Annotated Code:
The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic of the function `func_1()`. It states that the function processes a test case consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) and prints 'Yes' if \( (n - m) \) is even and non-negative, otherwise it prints 'No'.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment claims that the program does not correctly handle the case where \( n \) is less than \( m \). The assessment suggests that the condition should also check if \( n \geq m \).

However, let's re-examine the problem statement and the logic of the program:

1. **Problem Statement**: Nikita can only add or remove exactly one cube per move. Therefore, the difference between \( n \) and \( m \) must be even and non-negative for it to be possible to end up with \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves.
2. **Current Condition**: The program checks if \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( n - m \geq 0 \).
3. **Additional Check**: The additional check \( n \geq m \) is necessary because if \( n < m \), it is impossible to end up with \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves, regardless of the parity of \( n - m \).

Given the problem constraints and the logic of the program, the current condition already ensures that \( n \geq m \) implicitly through the check \( n - m \geq 0 \). If \( n - m \) is negative, the condition \( n - m \geq 0 \) fails, and the program prints 'No'. This means the program correctly handles the case where \( n < m \).

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate. The program needs to include the additional check \( n \geq m \) to ensure correctness.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect according to the original assessment, as it requires the additional check \( n \geq m \) to handle all cases correctly.
