Output State: **`max_diff` is -inf, `next_max_diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`, `index` is None, `i` is 3, `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `diff` to `next_max_diff`. Since `diff` is initially `A[1] - A[0]`, `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[1] - A[0]`. The other variables (`max_diff`, `index`, `i`, and `diff`) remain unchanged.
