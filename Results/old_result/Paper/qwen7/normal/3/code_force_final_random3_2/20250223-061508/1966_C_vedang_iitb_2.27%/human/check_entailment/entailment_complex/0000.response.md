Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the initial configuration of stone piles. Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move to win the game.

2. **Key Insight**: The game can be analyzed using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is zero, the player about to move (the second player) will lose if both players play optimally. Otherwise, the player about to move (the first player) will win.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function sorts the unique values of the piles and then modifies them. However, the description of the function and its purpose do not align with the problem's requirement to determine the winner based on the Nim-sum. The function does not compute the Nim-sum or any relevant value for determining the winner.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to determine the winner by recursively checking the configuration of the piles. However, it does not correctly implement the logic for determining the Nim-sum or the optimal strategy. Specifically, the base cases and recursive logic do not cover all scenarios and do not correctly simulate the game's outcome.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The annotated function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner based on the Nim-sum. The function's approach to recursion and base cases is flawed and does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy for the game.
   - The function `func_1` does not contribute to solving the problem as it does not compute the Nim-sum or any relevant value for determining the winner.

Given the above analysis, the provided functions do not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
