Output State: **`eta_ln` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, and the list `eta` contains the values `[n, n, n, ..., n]` (a list of `n + 1` elements, all being `n`).**

Explanation: The code `eta_ln = len(eta)` calculates the length of the list `eta`, which is `n + 1`. The variables `j` and the list `eta` remain unchanged from their previous states.
