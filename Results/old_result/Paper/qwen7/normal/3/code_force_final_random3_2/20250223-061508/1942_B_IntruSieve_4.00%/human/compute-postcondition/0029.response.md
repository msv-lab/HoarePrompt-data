Output State: **`minn` is either `maxx` + 1 or equal to the current value of `maxx`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `mex` is a list containing one additional element which is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`, `maxx` is updated to the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` if `abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates `maxx` to the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` if this difference is greater than the current value of `maxx`. If `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is not greater than `maxx`, `maxx` remains unchanged. The other variables (`minn`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `mex`, and `i`) are not affected by this line of code.
