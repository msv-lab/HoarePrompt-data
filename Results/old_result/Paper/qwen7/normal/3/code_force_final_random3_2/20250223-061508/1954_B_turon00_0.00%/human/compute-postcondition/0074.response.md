Postcondition: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `tmp` is now equal to `a[0]`, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of unique integers, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`. If the set `aa` contains exactly one element, then no changes are made to `ans`, `tmp`, `t`, `a`, and `aa`.**
