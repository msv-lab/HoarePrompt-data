Output State: **`mini` is equal to `n+1`, `res` is the input string, `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, `i` is either `n` or `n+1`, `arr` must be one of `[n, n+1]` or `[n, n, n+1]`**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `res`. The other variables (`mini`, `maxi`, `i`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
