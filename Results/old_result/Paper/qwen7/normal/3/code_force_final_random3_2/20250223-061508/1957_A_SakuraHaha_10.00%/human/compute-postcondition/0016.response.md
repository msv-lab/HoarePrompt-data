Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `x` and `cnt`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over the values of `cnt`. In each iteration, `x` takes the next value from `cnt.values()`, and `ans` is updated by adding `x // 4` to its current value.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is increased by the previous value of `x // 4`.
   - `x` is the next value from `cnt.values()`.
   - `ans` is now `ans` plus `x // 4`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is the next value from `cnt.values()`, it means `x` will take the next key value from the dictionary `cnt`.
   - `ans` will be updated by adding the new value of `x // 4` to its current value.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The variable `ans` will be updated by adding the new value of `x // 4`.
   - The variable `x` will be the next value from `cnt.values()`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ans` is `ans` plus the next value of `x // 4`, `x` is the next value from `cnt.values()`**
