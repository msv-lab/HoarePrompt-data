Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `adv` is `min(a[1] - a[2] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `ans` contains `a[1] - 2`, `ans` now also contains `a[2] - 1 - 1`**

Explanation: The code appends `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 1, `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]`. Therefore, `a[i - 1] - j - 1` simplifies to `a[1] - 1 - 1`, which is `a[1] - 2`. Since `ans` initially contains `a[1] - 2`, it now also contains `a[2] - 2`. However, since `a[2] - 2` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, we only confirm the addition of `a[2] - 1 - 1` (which is `a[2] - 2`). The values of `i`, `j`, `adv`, and the existing content of `ans` remain unchanged.
