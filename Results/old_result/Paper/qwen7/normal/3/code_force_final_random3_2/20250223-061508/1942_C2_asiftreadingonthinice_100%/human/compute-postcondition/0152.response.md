Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, the difference between the first two elements of `a` is not equal to 2, and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even; `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given that `i` is 1, this translates to `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`. Since the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, `(a[1] - a[0])` is even, and thus `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` is an integer. The other conditions remain unchanged.
