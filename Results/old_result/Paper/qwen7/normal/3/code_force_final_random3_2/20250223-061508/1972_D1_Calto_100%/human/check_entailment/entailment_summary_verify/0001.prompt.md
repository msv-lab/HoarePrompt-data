You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts two positive integers, n and m, and returns a value cnt that is always 10, regardless of the values of n and m within the specified range.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Functions:**
   - `func_1(a, b)` is a function to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - `func_2(n, m)` is supposed to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) for the given \(n\) and \(m\).

3. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It is correct and will work as expected.

4. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
   - It then increments the count `cnt` using `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

### Issues with `func_2`:

- **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs:**
  - The logic inside the loop does not correctly determine the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
  - The variables \(x\) and \(y\) do not seem to be related to the problem statement at all.
  - The expression `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` does not correctly count the valid pairs.

### Example Test Cases:

Let's manually check a few test cases to see if `func_2` works correctly:

- **Test Case 1: \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\)**
  - Expected output: 1 (only pair \((1, 1)\))
  - Actual output: 1 (correct)

- **Test Case 2: \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)**
  - Expected output: 3 (pairs \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 1)\))
  - Actual output: 3 (correct)

- **Test Case 3: \(n = 3\), \(m = 5\)**
  - Expected output: 4 (pairs \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), \((2, 1)\))
  - Actual output: 4 (correct)

- **Test Case 4: \(n = 10\), \(m = 8\)**
  - Expected output: 14 (pairs include \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), etc.)
  - Actual output: 14 (correct)

- **Test Case 5: \(n = 100\), \(m = 1233\)**
  - Expected output: 153 (more complex, but the function should handle it correctly)
  - Actual output: 153 (correct)

- **Test Case 6: \(n = 1000000\), \(m = 1145141\)**
  - Expected output: 1643498 (very large, but the function should handle it correctly)
  - Actual output: 1643498 (correct)

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the code and the test cases, it appears that the function `func_2` is not correctly implemented to solve the problem. The logic inside the loop does not match the required conditions.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **False**
