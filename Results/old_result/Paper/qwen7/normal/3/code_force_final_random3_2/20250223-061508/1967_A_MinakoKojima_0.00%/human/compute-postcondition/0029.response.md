Output State: `ans` is updated to its current value multiplied by the difference between each consecutive element in the array `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `k` is `0`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached `n`, as the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n-1`. The value of `ans` will be the product of differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the array `a` starting from index 1 to `n-1`. The variables `k` and `a[i]` (which is updated to `m` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
