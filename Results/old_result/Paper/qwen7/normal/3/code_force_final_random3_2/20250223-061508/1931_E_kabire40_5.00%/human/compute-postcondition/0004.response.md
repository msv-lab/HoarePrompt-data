Output State: **`operational_list` is a list containing the split elements of the input string, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the length of the input string, `max_power` is the maximum power of the input string.**

Explanation: The code `operational_list = input().split()` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on whitespace, and assigns these elements to the list `operational_list`. The other variables (`rev_val`, `rev_res`, `list_len`, and `max_power`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
