Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be set to `n`, `j` will be `n + 1`, and both `a` and `b` will be lists of length `n + 1`. For each index `k` from 2 to `n + 1`, if the character `x[k - 2]` is 'F', then `a[k]` will be the count of 'F's before index `k - 1` in `x`; if the character `x[k - 2]` is 'S', then `b[k]` will be the count of 'S's before index `k - 1` in `x`.**

This means that after the loop completes, the array `a` will contain the cumulative counts of 'F' characters up to each index, and the array `b` will contain the cumulative counts of 'S' characters up to each index, starting from index 2. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, and `j` will be one more than `n` since the loop increments `j` from 1 to `n + 1`.
