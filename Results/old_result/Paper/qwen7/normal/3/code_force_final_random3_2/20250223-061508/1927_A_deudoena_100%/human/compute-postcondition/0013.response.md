Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` as it iterates over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `s`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must have at least one 'B'.
   - `j` is the first character in `s` and its value is 'B'.
   - `c` is 1.
   - `mi` is 1.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` is the first character in `s` and its value is 'B', the loop will continue if there are more characters in `s`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should now point to the second character in `s`.
   - The string `s` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications are made to `s`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `s` remains the same.
   - `j` moves to the second character in `s`.
   - `c` and `mi` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must have at least one 'B', `j` is the second character in `s`, `c` is 1, `mi` is 1**.
