Output State: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in the list `a`.

This final output state indicates that after all iterations of the loop have been executed, the dictionary `cnt` contains the count of each unique element in the list `a`. The variable `ans` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop. The values of `t` and `n` also remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
