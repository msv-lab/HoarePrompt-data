You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case is represented by a line of input containing four space-separated integers. These integers represent the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence. For each test case, the function calculates a specific value based on these counts and prints the result. The final state of the program includes a series of lines, each containing the calculated result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers representing the count of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.

3. **Core Logic**:
   - The program uses a list comprehension inside a map function to convert the input string into integers.
   - It then calculates the sum using a generator expression within the list comprehension.
   - The formula used is `sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))` where:
     - `i` is the index of the element.
     - `x` is the count of the corresponding number (1, 2, 3, 4).
     - The formula `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)` seems to be attempting to convert counts into a form that can be used to determine the number of Bob's wins.
   - Finally, the result is divided by 3 and converted to a string before joining them with newline characters.

4. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)` does not correctly represent the logic needed to solve the problem.
   - To determine the maximum number of Bob's wins, we need to consider the parity (odd/even) of the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - Specifically, we need to ensure that the final XOR result is zero, which means the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s must be even (since 4s do not affect the XOR result).

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Count the total number of 1s, 2s, and 3s.
   - The number of Bob's wins is the minimum of these counts (since each removal of a 1, 2, or 3 contributes to reducing the count and eventually making the XOR zero).

6. **Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation should be:
     ```python
     def func():
         t = int(input())
         for _ in range(t):
             p = list(map(int, input().split()))
             ones, twos, threes = p[0], p[1], p[2]
             # Calculate the minimum of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s
             bob_wins = min(ones, twos, threes)
             print(bob_wins)
     ```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
