Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    count = a.count('1')
    if count == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count > 2 and count % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count == 2:
        if a[a.index('1') + 1] != '1':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string from the user, `count` is the number of times '1' appears in `a`. If `count` is 0, the function does nothing. Otherwise, `count` is not equal to 0, and it remains unchanged if `count` is greater than 2 and even. If `count` is not greater than 2 or even, then `count` is either exactly 2 with specific conditions (next character after the first '1' is not '1' or the character following the first '1' is '1'), or `count` is greater than 2 or even.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `t` must be at least 1, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is the new input string from the user, `count` is the number of times '1' appears in `a`. Regardless of the condition, the values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `count` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `t` must be at least 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string from the user, `count` is the number of times '1' appears in `a`. If `count` is 0, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
