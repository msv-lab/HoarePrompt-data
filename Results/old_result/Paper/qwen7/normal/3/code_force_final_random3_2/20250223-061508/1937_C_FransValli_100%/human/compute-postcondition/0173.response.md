Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `res` is the input string provided by the user.
   - `maxi` is equal to `i + 1`.
   - `i` is equal to `i + 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `maxi` is initially set to `i + 1`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 after being set to `i + 1`. Therefore, `i` becomes `i + 1 + 1 = i + 2`.

Since `i` was initially set to `i + 1`, and then incremented by 1, `i` now holds the value of `i + 2`.

Given this, the print statement will output:
- `'?'` (a literal string)
- `maxi` (which is `i + 1`)
- `maxi` again (which is `i + 1`)
- `i` (which is `i + 2`)
- `i` again (which is `i + 2`)

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? [i+1] [i+1] [i+2] [i+2]** (where `[i+1]` and `[i+2]` represent the values of `maxi` and `i` respectively).
