Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The initial state of `t` being `t - 1` and `a` being a sorted list of integers remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still `t - 1`, `n` is now an integer input by the user, and `a` remains a sorted list of integers.
