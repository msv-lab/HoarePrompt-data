Reasoning: 

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to verify this.

### Problem Analysis
- **Objective**: Determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move involves adding or removing exactly one cube.
- **Constraints**: \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\).
- **Key Insight**: The difference between `n` and `m` must be even and non-negative for it to be possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, so the parity (even or odd nature) of the difference must match the parity of the number of moves.

### Provided Solution
The provided solution in the program is:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Function Summary
The function `func_1()` processes a test case consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) and prints 'Yes' if \( (n - m) \) is even and non-negative, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but modifies the output based on the condition.

### Correctness Check
1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even.
   - The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that the difference is non-negative.
   
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n < m`, the difference `n - m` is negative, and the condition `n - m >= 0` fails, correctly returning 'No'.
   - If `n == m`, the difference is zero, which is even, and the condition is satisfied, correctly returning 'Yes'.
   - If `n > m`, the difference is positive, and the condition is checked correctly.

3. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For `n = 3` and `m = 3`: `(3 - 3) % 2 == 0` and `3 - 3 >= 0` are both true, so the output is 'Yes'.
   - For `n = 2` and `m = 4`: `(2 - 4) % 2 == 0` is true, but `2 - 4 < 0`, so the output is 'No'.
   - For `n = 5` and `m = 3`: `(5 - 3) % 2 == 0` and `5 - 3 >= 0` are both true, so the output is 'Yes'.

The provided solution correctly handles all edge cases and satisfies the problem constraints.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The provided solution is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

Final: **True**
