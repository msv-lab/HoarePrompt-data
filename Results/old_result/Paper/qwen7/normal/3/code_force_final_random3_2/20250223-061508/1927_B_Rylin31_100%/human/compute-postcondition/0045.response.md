Output State: **`ans` is a string where the last character is 't', the character at index `j-2` in `ans` is 'b', and the character at index `j-1` in `ans` is 'c'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` appends a character to the string `ans`. Given the initial conditions, the character at index `j-2` is 'b' and the character at index `j-1` is 'c'. The character being appended is calculated as `chr(s[j] + 97)`. Since `s[j]` is the character at index `j-1` which is 'c', its ASCII value is 99. Adding 97 to 99 gives 196, which corresponds to the character 't' in ASCII. Thus, the string `ans` now ends with 't', and the characters at indices `j-2` and `j-1` remain 'b' and 'c' respectively.
