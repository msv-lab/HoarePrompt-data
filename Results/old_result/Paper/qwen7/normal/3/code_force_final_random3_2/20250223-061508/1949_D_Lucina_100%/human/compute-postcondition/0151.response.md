Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 4, `n` is 3, `a[3]` is 0, `b[3]` is 0, `sa` is [1, 2, 3, 4], `sb` is [1, 2, 3]**.

The code `sa.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 4) to the list `sa`. Initially, `sa` is `[1, 2, 3]`. After appending 4, `sa` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
