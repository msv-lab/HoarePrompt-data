Output State: **`i` is 50, `n` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is an input integer, `flag` remains unchanged or is True if any `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1` for any `i` in the range of `x`, `l` is a list of integers created from user input.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `l` by taking space-separated integers as input and converting them into a list using `map(int, input().strip().split())`. The values of `i`, `n`, `x`, and `flag` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new list `l` is created based on the user's input.
