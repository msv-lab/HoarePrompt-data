Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty string of length `n-1` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the current character in the string `a`; if `s` is '0', `x` is the last element of the list `S[1]` plus 2; otherwise, `x` is the last element of the list `S[1]` plus 1; `y` is the last element of the list `S[0]` plus 1; `S` is now `[S[0], S[1], [x, y]]`.
