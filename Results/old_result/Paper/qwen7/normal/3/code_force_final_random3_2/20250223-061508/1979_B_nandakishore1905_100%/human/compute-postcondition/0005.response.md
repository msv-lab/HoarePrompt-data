Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\)
- `m` is an integer
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `k` is a power of 2

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print(k)` is executed.

First, let's consider the value of `k`. Since `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and it is specified that `k` is a power of 2, `k` could be any of the following values: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, or 32768. However, since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), the maximum possible value for `k` is 9999 (when `m = 1`).

Among the powers of 2 that are within this range, the largest possible value is 8192 (since \(2^{13} = 8192\) and \(2^{14} = 16384\) exceeds 9999).

Therefore, `k` can be any power of 2 up to 8192, but without additional constraints on `m`, we cannot determine a specific value for `k`.

Thus, the output will be one of the powers of 2 up to 8192, depending on the value of `m`.

Output: **k (where k is a power of 2 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 8192)**
