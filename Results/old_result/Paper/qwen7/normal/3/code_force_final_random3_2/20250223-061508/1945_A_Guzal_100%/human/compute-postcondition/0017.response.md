Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `k` is 0.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns 0 to the variable `k`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or the condition that `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces. The value of `k` is explicitly set to 0.
