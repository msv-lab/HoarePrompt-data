Postcondition: `x` and `y` are elements of list `S`. If the value of `s` is '0', then `x` is equal to the last element of list `S` plus 1, and `y` is equal to the last element of list `S`. Otherwise, `x` is equal to the last element of list `S`, and `y` is equal to the last element of list `S` plus 1.
