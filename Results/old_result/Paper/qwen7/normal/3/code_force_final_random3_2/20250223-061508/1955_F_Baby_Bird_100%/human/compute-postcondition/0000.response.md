Let's break down the code step by step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Input Reading**: The code reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. Each test case will have a corresponding list `p_i` with four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.

2. **Inner Loop**: For each test case, the code processes the list `p_i` to calculate a specific value. The expression inside the loop is:
   \[
   \text{sum}(3 \times (\text{x} // 2) + \text{x} \% 2 \times (\text{i} < 3) \text{ for i, x in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))} // 3
   \]

3. **Breaking Down the Expression**:
   - `input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - `map(int, input().split())` converts these strings into integers.
   - `enumerate(map(int, input().split()))` gives us pairs of indices and values from the list of integers.
   - For each pair `(i, x)`, the expression `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)` is evaluated:
     - `x // 2` gives the quotient of `x` divided by 2.
     - `x % 2` gives the remainder of `x` divided by 2.
     - `3 * (x // 2)` multiplies the quotient by 3.
     - `x % 2 * (i < 3)` multiplies the remainder by 3 if `i` is less than 3 (i.e., `i` is 0, 1, or 2).
     - Adding these two results together gives the value for each element in the list.

4. **Summing and Dividing**: The result of the above expression for each element in the list is summed up, and then the total sum is divided by 3.

5. **Joining and Printing**: The result of this calculation for each test case is converted to a string and joined with newline characters (`\n`). This list of strings is then printed.

Given the initial state, the exact values of `p_i` are not provided, but we know that each `p_i` is a list of four non-negative integers whose sum is at most 200. Therefore, the output will be a series of lines, each containing the result of the described calculation for each test case.

Output: **a series of lines, each containing the result of the described calculation for each test case**
