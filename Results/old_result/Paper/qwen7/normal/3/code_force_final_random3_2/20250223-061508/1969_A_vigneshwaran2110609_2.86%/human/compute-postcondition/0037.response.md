Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive); `flag` is True**

The code initializes the variable `flag` to `True`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 1, and `x` is still required to be between 2 and 50 (inclusive). The new state includes that `flag` is now `True`.
