Output State: **`p2` contains ['a', 'a'], `ops` is a list containing [('v1', v2)], `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n excluding the last two integers, and the current value of `v2` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The line `ops += [(v1, v2)]` appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. Since `ops` was initially an empty list, it now contains one element, which is the tuple `(v1, v2)`. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the precondition.
