Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `i` will be equal to the number of test cases provided as input. For each test case, the variables `n` and `m` will hold the last pair of integers entered for that test case. The variable `k` will be the absolute difference between `n` and `m` for the last test case. If `k` is a power of 2, it remains unchanged. If `k` is odd, it remains 1. If `k` is even and not a power of 2, after processing through the while loop, `k` will become 0, and `l` will be "0", `p` will be 1, and `q` will be 2.**

This means that after all iterations, the final values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, `q`, and `f` will reflect the last test case processed by the loop, with `k` adjusted according to the conditions specified in the loop body.
