Output State: **All elements in `arr` have been processed; `count` is the sum of `freq[rx, ry]` for each unique pair `(rx, ry)` where `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` and `ry = a % y`, plus 1 for each occurrence of the pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`; `rx` and `ry` are calculated for the last element `a` in `arr`; `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y); `freq` is updated to reflect the frequency of each unique pair `(rx, ry)` and `(a % x, a % y)` encountered during the loop execution; `results` is appended with the value of `count`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` to the list `results`. This does not change the values of `arr`, `count`, `rx`, `ry`, `current_pair`, or `freq`. It only adds the current value of `count` to the `results` list.
