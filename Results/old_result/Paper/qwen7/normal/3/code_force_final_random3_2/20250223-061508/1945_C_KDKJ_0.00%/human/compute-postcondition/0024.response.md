Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty string of length `n-1` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the current character in the string `a`; `x` is the last element of the list `S[1]` plus 1; `y` is the last element of the list `S[0]` plus 1; `S` is now `[S[0], S[1], [x, y]]`.

Explanation: If the current character `s` in the string `a` is '0', then `x` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, both `x` and `y` are incremented by 1. In both cases, `S` is updated accordingly.
