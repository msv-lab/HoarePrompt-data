The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. This means that the code inside the loop following the `continue` statement will not be executed for the current iteration. However, the values of the variables `trumps`, `answers`, `suits`, `rank`, and `suit` remain unchanged from their previous states.

Output State: **`trumps` is a list containing all ranks of cards that match the trump suit except for the last one, `answers` is a list containing all valid answers generated during the loop execution with the new element added which is a string formatted as f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}', `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value must be something other than `None`, `rank` is the value corresponding to the next key in `suits`, and `suit` is the next key in `suits`. The loop continues to the next iteration without executing the code that follows the `continue` statement.**
