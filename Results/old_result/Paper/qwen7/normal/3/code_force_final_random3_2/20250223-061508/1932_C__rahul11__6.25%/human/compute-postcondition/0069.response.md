Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for k in range(n - 1):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `k` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will start with `k = 0` and continue until `k < n - 1`.
   - Therefore, `k` must be initialized to 0 or some value less than `n - 1` for the loop to start.

3. **Check the Given Initial States:**
   - `c` is 1 (not relevant to the loop).
   - `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD` (not relevant to the loop).
   - `arr` remains unchanged (not relevant to the loop).
   - `l` is 0 (not relevant to the loop).
   - `r` is `n - 1` (not directly relevant to the loop, but useful for context).

4. **Adjust the Relevant States:**
   - Since `k` is the variable that drives the loop, it should be set to 0 initially.
   - The value of `n` is required to determine the upper limit of the loop. It should be provided as it is not given explicitly.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `k` and `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`k` is 0, `n` is the number of elements in the array**
