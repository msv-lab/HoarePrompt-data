Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from splitting `data[idx]` and converting each element to an integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer, `test_cases` is a list containing a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `idx` is increased by 2, `arr` is updated to be a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer, and `test_cases` has been appended with a new tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`**.

This means that the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` has been added to the `test_cases` list. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
