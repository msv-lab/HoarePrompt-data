Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `e` is a set containing unique elements from the list `l`, `m` is the length of the list `l`, `n` is an input integer, and `m` is reassigned to the length of the list `l`.** 

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts since neither part changes the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `e`, `m`, or `n` (except that `m` is reassigned to the length of `l` at the start of the if-else block). Therefore, the overall postcondition is identical to the precondition.
