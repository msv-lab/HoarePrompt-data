Postcondition: **`k` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is updated to either `ans // arr[l] % MOD` or `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `l` is 3 or 2, `r` is adjusted accordingly (`r - 1` or `r - 2`), `res[c]` (where `c` is 1) is calculated and stored as `ans % m % MOD` based on the condition `s[3]` being 'L' or not.**
