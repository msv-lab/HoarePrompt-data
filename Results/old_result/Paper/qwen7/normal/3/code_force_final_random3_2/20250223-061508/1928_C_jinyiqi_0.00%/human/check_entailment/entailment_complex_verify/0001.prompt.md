You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns a list that combines the quotients when `x` is divided by each of its divisors from the largest divisor less than or equal to \(\sqrt{x}\) down to 1, followed by the divisors themselves.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list. This list contains the quotients of `x` divided by each of its divisors from the largest divisor less than or equal to \(\sqrt{x}\) down to 1, followed by the divisors themselves.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `x`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function finds all divisors of a given number `x`.
   - It returns a list of divisors in ascending order.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, it checks two conditions:
     - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`
     - `(n - x) % 2 == 0`
   - If either condition is true, it calls `func_1` with the appropriate value (`n + x - 2` or `n - x`).
   - It then iterates over the divisors returned by `func_1` and checks if they satisfy the condition `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
   - If a divisor satisfies the condition, it is added to the `output` list.
   - Finally, it removes duplicates from the `output` list using `set`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Condition Checking:**
   - The condition `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` ensures that `n + x - 2` is even, which is necessary for the settling pattern to repeat correctly.
   - Similarly, `(n - x) % 2 == 0` ensures that `n - x` is even.

2. **Divisor Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates all divisors of the given number.
   - However, the logic in the main part of the program uses the divisors in reverse order (`output2 + output1`), but it should use them in ascending order to match the settling pattern.

3. **Condition for Valid `k`:**
   - The condition `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` ensures that `s + 2` is even, meaning `s` is even.
   - The condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` ensures that the calculated `k` is at least as large as `x`.

4. **Output:**
   - The final output is a list of unique valid `k` values.

### Conclusion:

The program logic is mostly correct, but there is a small issue with the order of divisors returned by `func_1`. The divisors should be used in ascending order, not reversed. However, this does not affect the correctness of the solution since the conditions are still met correctly.

Therefore, the program is correct in terms of functionality and logic.

Correctness: **True**
