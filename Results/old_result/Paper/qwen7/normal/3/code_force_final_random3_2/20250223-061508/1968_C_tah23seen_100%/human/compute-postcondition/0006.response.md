Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is 10^9 except `ans[i]` which is now `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` where `i` is `n - 4`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` where `i` is `n - 4`. This means that the value of `ans[n-4]` is changed from its original value (which was \(10^9\)) to the new value calculated as `ans[n-3] - arr[n-4]`. All other values in the `ans` list remain unchanged and are still \(10^9\). The `arr` list remains unchanged as well.
