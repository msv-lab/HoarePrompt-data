Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `input()` and converts it to an integer.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - A function `func_1()` is defined but not implemented. This is problematic because the function is called inside the loop without any implementation.

3. **Reading Test Cases**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program correctly reads two integers `n` and `m` for each test case using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`.

4. **Logic Check**:
   - The logic to check if it is possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves is correct. Specifically, the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative, which means the operations can balance out to achieve `m` cubes.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints "Yes" or "No" based on the logic check, which is correct according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical error due to the unimplemented function `func_1()`. However, if we assume the intention was to call `func_1()` within the loop to process each test case, the core logic for determining whether it is possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves is correct.

Given the context and assuming the intention was to call `func_1()` instead of leaving it undefined, the program should be modified to:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

Since the core logic is correct and the function should be called to process each test case, the correctness of the program is contingent on this assumption.

Correctness: **False** (due to the unimplemented function `func_1()`)

If the function `func_1()` is implemented as intended, the correctness would be **True**.
