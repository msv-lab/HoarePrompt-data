Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The function `func_2()` is called, but since no changes to variables are made within the function call itself (no assignment statements or operations affecting `t` are provided), the precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, the only information we can provide about the state is that `t` must still be greater than 0.
