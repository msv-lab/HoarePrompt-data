Output State: **`prev` is now equal to `curr`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `tree` is a list containing `s` and `curr`, `curr` is `nodes[s][0]`, `curr` is not equal to `e`, and the current value of `nodes[curr][0]` is equal to the previous value of `prev`.**

This means that the variable `prev` has been updated to the current value of `curr`, while all other conditions and values remain unchanged as per the initial state.
