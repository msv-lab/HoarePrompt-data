Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input(''))` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it must be greater than 0, and `n` is assigned the integer value of the input provided by the user.
