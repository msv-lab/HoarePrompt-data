Postcondition: `done` is `True`, and either `count` is greater than 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `count` is equal to `j`, `count2` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is `True` and `count` remains unchanged, continuing the loop or iteration. If the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`, `done` is `True` and either `count` is greater than 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `count` is equal to `j`, `count2` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is `True` and `count` remains unchanged, continuing the loop or iteration. If the character at index `j` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`, `done` is `True`, `count` is equal to `j`, and `count2` is incremented by 1.
