Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[-1]` is decreased by 1**

Explanation: The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the value at index `-1` of list `a` by 1. However, since the initial state does not provide the actual list `a`, we only know that `a[-1]` has been decreased by 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
