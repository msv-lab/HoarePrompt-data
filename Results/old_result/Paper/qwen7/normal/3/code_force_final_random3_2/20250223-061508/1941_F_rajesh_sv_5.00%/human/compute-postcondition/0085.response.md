Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `l` is now `mid + 1`; `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`.**

Explanation: The line `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to be `mid + 1`. All other variables (`ans`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `mid`, `left`, `right`, and `f`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
