Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), followed by t test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), each being either 0 or 1. The function checks if at least one cell contains a chip and returns a boolean value: True if at least one cell contains a chip in all test cases, and False otherwise.**
