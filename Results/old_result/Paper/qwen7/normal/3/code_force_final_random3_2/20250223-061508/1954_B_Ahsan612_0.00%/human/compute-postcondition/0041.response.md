Based on the initial state provided:

- `minn` is the minimum value between its current value (1) and `same`. Since `same` is not explicitly defined, we assume it starts at 1 initially.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, but this variable is not used in the print statement.
- `n` is an input integer, but its value is not specified.
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `same` is updated to be 1 if a different number is encountered or remains the same if the same number continues consecutively.
- `num` is the last element of the list `ar` that was processed.
- `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, the length of the list `ar`.
- `minn` is not infinity, so it must have been initialized to a finite value.

Given these conditions, `minn` will be the minimum value between its initial value (1) and `same`. Since `same` is updated based on consecutive elements in the list `ar`, and assuming the list does not contain any negative numbers or zero (as no specific values are given), `same` will remain 1 unless there is a different number in the list.

Therefore, `minn` will be 1 because it is the smallest value between 1 and any non-negative integer `same` can be.

Output: **1**
