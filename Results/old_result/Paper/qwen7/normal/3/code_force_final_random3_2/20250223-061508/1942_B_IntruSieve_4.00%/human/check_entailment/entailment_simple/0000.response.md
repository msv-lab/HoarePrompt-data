Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) from the given array \( a \) such that \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The function `func_1()` is supposed to handle this construction for each test case.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes `minn` and `maxx` to 0.
   - It iterates through the array \( a \) and calculates the MEX value for each position.
     - If \( a_i > 0 \), it appends `minn` to the `mex` list and increments `minn` by 1. This ensures that `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.
     - If \( a_i \leq 0 \), it appends the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` to the `mex` list. This step ensures that the MEX condition is met.
   - After processing all elements, it prints the elements of `mex`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for calculating the MEX and constructing the permutation seems correct. The `minn` variable ensures that each element in the permutation is unique and follows the MEX condition.
   - The function correctly handles the constraints and guarantees that at least one valid permutation exists for the given data.

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The function prints the elements of `mex` in the required format, which should match the expected output format.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
