Output State: **`minn` is 1, `same` is either 3 or 1, `i` is less than `len(ar) - 1`, and `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`minn`, `same`, and `num`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition that `i` is less than `len(ar) - 1` is still valid.
