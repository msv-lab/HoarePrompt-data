Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; `input` is set to `sys.stdin.readline`; for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.readline` simply reassigns the `input` variable to refer to the `sys.stdin.readline` function. This does not change the values of any other variables or lists. It just updates what `input` refers to.
