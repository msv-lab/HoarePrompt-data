Output State: **`shapes` is 6, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `pl` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `pl`. This does not affect the values of `shapes`, `w`, `ln`, or `palka`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `pl` is updated to be an empty list.
