Output State: **`xx` is a 2D list, `i` and `j` are indices within `xx`, `nx` is 'FS', `j` is `j + 1`, and `n` is the same.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends 'S' to the string stored in `nx`. Since `nx` was either 'F' or 'S', after appending 'S', `nx` becomes 'FS'. The other variables (`xx`, `i`, `j`, and `n`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
