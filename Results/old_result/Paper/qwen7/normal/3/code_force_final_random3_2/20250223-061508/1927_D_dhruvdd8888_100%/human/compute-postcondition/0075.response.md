Output State: **`eli` is the updated index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`, `s` is the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `e` is the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `_` is 2, `l` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))` finds the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`. This changes the value of `eli` to the appropriate index. The values of `s` and `e` remain unchanged as they are determined by the tuple at the `min(eli, LA)` index, which is not modified by this line of code. The other variables (`_`, `l`, `r`) remain as they were in the initial state.
