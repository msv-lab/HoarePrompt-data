Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). Specifically, the program only works correctly for \(n = 3\) and \(n = 4\) based on the given examples, but fails for other values of \(n\).

For instance, for \(n = 2\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
```
This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), which is correct.

However, for \(n = 5\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
2 4
5 5
4 4
```
This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\), which is not the maximum possible set for \(n = 5\). The correct output should include more distant points to maximize the Manhattan distances.

For \(n = 6\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
2 4
6 6
6 6
5 5
```
This also does not maximize the set \(\mathcal{H}\).

A correct approach would involve placing points in such a way that maximizes the variety of Manhattan distances, which requires a more sophisticated strategy than the current implementation.
