Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `len(a)` is greater than 1, `ans` is the sum of all increments made to it within the loop plus 1 if the condition `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2` is met, `tmp` contains all the values added to it whenever the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` was met, and if `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0`, then `tmp` includes the value of `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, `tmp` is sorted.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `tmp` is a non-empty list, `y` is an integer. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `y` is equal to its original value minus `(i - 1)`, and `ans` is increased by `i`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, then the most internal loop or if statement is exited, and the values of `y` and `ans` remain unchanged from their preconditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `tmp` is a non-empty list with length `len(tmp) - 1`, `y` is an integer. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is increased by `i` and `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `tmp` is a non-empty list with length `len(tmp) - 1`, `y` is an integer. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)` and `ans` is increased by the value of `i`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
