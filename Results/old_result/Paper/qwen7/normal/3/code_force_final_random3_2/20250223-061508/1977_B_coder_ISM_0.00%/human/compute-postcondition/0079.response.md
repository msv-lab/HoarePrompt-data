Output State: **`i` is 28, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[0]` is either '0' or '1', `s[1] is '1', `s[2]` is '1', ..., `s[29]` is '1', `s[30]` is '1', and `flag` is true.**

The code `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Initially, `s` contains 30 elements, from `s[0]` to `s[29]`, all set to `'1'`, and `s[29]` is `'0'`. After appending `'1'`, the length of `s` increases by one, making the new last element `s[30]` equal to `'1'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
