Output State: The loop will execute \(n-1\) times in total. After all iterations, the value of `i` will be \(n-1\). The variable `answer` will contain \(n\) elements. The elements in `answer` will alternate between the last remaining element of `array` (as `a[-1]` decreases) and the first element of `array` (as `a[0]` increases). Specifically, `a[-1]` will start at \(n+1\) and decrease to \(1\), while `a[0]` will start at \(1\) and increase to \(n\). Therefore, `answer` will start with `1` and then alternate between the elements of `array` based on the conditions inside the loop. The final `answer` list will contain the elements of `array` in a specific order determined by the loop's logic, with `1` as the first element and alternating between the last and first elements of `array` as `i` changes.

In summary, the final `answer` list will contain `n` elements, starting with `1` and following the described alternating pattern based on the loop conditions, with `a[-1]` ending at `1` and `a[0]` ending at `n`.
