Output State: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique integer in the list `a`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `cnt` will contain the count of each unique integer present in the list `a`. The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a` and updates the count of `x` in the dictionary `cnt`. Since the loop processes every element in the list `a`, `cnt` will have an entry for every unique integer in `a`, with the value being the total count of that integer in the list. The values of `ans`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
