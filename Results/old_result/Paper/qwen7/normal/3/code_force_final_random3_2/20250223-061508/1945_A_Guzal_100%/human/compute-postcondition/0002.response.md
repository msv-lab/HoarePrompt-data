Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input, splits them by spaces, and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
