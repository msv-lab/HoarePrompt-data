Output State: **`ans` is -1, `i` is 3, `lsum` is 3, `left` is `S[3][0]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[3][1]`, `rsum` is n - 3**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values.
