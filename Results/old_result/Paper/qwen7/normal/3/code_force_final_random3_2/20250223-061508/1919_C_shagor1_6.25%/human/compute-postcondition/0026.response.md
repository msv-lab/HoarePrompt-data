Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `x` is equal to the next element in `inp` (let's call it `a_new`), `y` is equal to `a_new`, `ans` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `a_new <= y` holds true, and `inp` must have at least one element remaining, `y` is now equal to `a`.**

Explanation: The code `y = a` assigns the value of `a` (which is the same as `x`) to `y`. All other variables remain unchanged.
