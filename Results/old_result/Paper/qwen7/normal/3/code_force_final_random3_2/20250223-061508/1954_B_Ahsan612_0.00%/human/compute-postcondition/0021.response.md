Output State: **`minn` is the minimum of `minn` (initially infinity) and `same` (which is 1); `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[4]`; `i` is 4.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ar[i]` to `num`. Since `i` is 4, `num` is now the fifth element of the list `ar`. All other variables remain unchanged.
