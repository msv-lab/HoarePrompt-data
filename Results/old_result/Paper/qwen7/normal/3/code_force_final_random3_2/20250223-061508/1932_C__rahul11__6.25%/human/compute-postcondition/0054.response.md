Output State: **`n` is 1, `m` is the second integer input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by converting each element of the space-separated input into an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. The first element of the input is implicitly used to initialize `n`, and the second element is stored in `m`. All other variables remain unchanged.
