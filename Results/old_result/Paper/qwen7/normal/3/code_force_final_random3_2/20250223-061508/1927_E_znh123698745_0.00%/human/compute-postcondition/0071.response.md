Output State: **`i` must be within the range [1, n-1], and the current value of `i` is odd; `answer` has the last element of `array` appended to it; `a[-1]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of array `a` by 1. The conditions for `i` and the state of `answer` remain unchanged.
