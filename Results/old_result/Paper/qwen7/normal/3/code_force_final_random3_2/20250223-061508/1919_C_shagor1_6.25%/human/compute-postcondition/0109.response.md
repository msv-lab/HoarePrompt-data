Postcondition: `inp` is a non-empty list of integers, `a` is the first element in `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `a` is set to `x` and `ans` is incremented by 1. If `a` is greater than `x`, then `a` is greater than `x` and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.
