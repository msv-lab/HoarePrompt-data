Output State: **`arr` is [0, i], `n` is at least 1, `maxi` is 0, `res` is an input string, `res` is not equal to '<', and the current value of `res` is '='.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains `[0]`. After appending `i`, `arr` becomes `[0, i]`. The other variables (`n`, `maxi`, `res`) remain unchanged with their respective conditions.
