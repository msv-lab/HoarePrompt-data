Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `_` is 2, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, `a` is assigned the first integer from input, `b` is assigned the second integer from input.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns the first integer to `a` and the second integer to `b`. The variables `t` and `_` remain unchanged from their initial state.
