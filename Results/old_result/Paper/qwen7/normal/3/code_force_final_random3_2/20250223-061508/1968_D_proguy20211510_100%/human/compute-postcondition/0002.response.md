Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, MOD is 1000000007, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**.

The code initializes a string `alpha` with the value `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`. This string does not affect the values of `t` or `MOD`, so their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `alpha` and retains the original values of `t` and `MOD`.
