Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, the condition `1 â‰¤ i < n` must be satisfied.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer
   - `flag` is `False`
   - `i` is `2`
   - `n` must be greater than `1`
   - The current value of `arr[i]` is not equal to the previous value of `arr[i - 1]`

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `2`, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should become `3`.
   - The condition `n > 1` must still hold true.
   - The value of `arr[i]` (which is `arr[3]` now) must not be equal to the previous value of `arr[i-1]` (which is `arr[2]`).

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `arr` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `flag` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` changes from `2` to `3`.
   - `n` must still be greater than `1`.
   - `arr[3]` must not be equal to `arr[2]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `flag` is False, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `arr[i]` is not equal to the previous value of `arr[i - 1]`.**
