Postcondition: `decoded` is either a list containing one additional element `'mapping[char]'`, or it contains the character 'z'. `mapping` remains unchanged, `encoded` remains unchanged, and `char` is the next character in `encoded`. If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` gets the new element. Otherwise, `c` is 97 (ord('a')), `decoded` contains 'z', `mapping` maps all letters from 'a' to 'z' to 'a', and `encoded` remains unchanged.
