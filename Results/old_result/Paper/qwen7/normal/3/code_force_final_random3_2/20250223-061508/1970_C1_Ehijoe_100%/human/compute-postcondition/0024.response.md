Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop iterates over the keys in the `nodes` dictionary. Therefore, the only variables involved in the loop head are `key` and `nodes`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition states that if the length of the list associated with the key is exactly 1, then `ends` contains the key that was appended. Otherwise, no change occurs in `ends`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `nodes` must have at least one key.
   - If the length of the list associated with the key is exactly 1, then `ends` contains the key that was appended. Otherwise, no change occurs in `ends`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over the keys in `nodes`, the variable `key` will be updated to the next key in `nodes`.
   - The variable `nodes` remains unchanged because the loop is only iterating over its keys and not modifying it.

5. **Check the Postcondition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `nodes` must still have at least one key.
   - The value of `ends` will either remain unchanged or be updated based on the current key being processed.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `nodes` still has at least one key, and `ends` may or may not be updated based on the current key.

**State: **`nodes` must have at least one key, `ends` may or may not contain the key that was appended (if the length of the list associated with the key is exactly 1)**
