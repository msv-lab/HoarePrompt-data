Output State: **`d` is a dictionary with the key `i` having the value 1, and `i` is a key in the dictionary.**

The code `d[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Since `d.get(i)` was `None` before, this assignment changes its value to `1`. The initial condition that `i` is a key in the dictionary remains true.
