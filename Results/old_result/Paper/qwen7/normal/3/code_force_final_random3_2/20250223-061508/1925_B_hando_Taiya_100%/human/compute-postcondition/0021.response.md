Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`, `i` is incremented to `i + 1` where `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration and `i + 1 <= isqrt(x)`**.

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`. This means `ans` now holds the maximum value between its previous value and the integer division of `x` by `i`. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1, and the new value of `i` is used in the next iteration. The conditions for `t`, `x`, `n`, and the relationship between `i` and `isqrt(x)` remain unchanged.
