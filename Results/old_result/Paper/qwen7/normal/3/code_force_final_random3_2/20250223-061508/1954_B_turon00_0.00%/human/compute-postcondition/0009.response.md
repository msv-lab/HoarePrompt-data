Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the elements of the list `a`. If the set `aa` contains only one unique element, the function does nothing.**
