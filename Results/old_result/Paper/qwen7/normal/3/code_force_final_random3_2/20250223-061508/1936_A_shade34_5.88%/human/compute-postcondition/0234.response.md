Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `0`, `n` must be at least 3, `s` is the final input string, and `pans` is a list containing the values of `i` from each iteration, starting from `n-1` down to `0`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` starts from `n-1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `0`. The variable `mak` is updated based on the user's input (`<` or `=`) during each iteration, but its exact value is not specified in the final state. The list `pans` collects all the values of `i` from the last iteration to the first, forming a list from `n-1` down to `0`. The variable `mak2` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.
