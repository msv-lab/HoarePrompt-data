You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        
        answer = [1]
        
        a = [1, -1]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])

            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        
        print(*answer)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute \(n-1\) times in total. After all iterations, the value of \(i\) will be \(n-1\). The variable `answer` will contain \(n\) elements, starting with 1 and following the pattern described by the loop conditions. Specifically, if \((-1)^i\) is -1, the element at `array[a[-1]]` will be appended to `answer` and `a[-1]` will be decreased by 1. Otherwise, the element at `array[a[0]]` will be appended to `answer` and `a[0]` will be increased by 1. The final state of `a` will be such that `a[0]` is \(n\) and `a[-1]` is 1. The `array` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The `answer` list will contain elements from the `array` in a specific alternating pattern based on the loop conditions, starting with 1 and ending with either the first or last element of the original `array`, depending on the parity of \(n\).
    #
    #In summary, the final `answer` list will contain \(n\) elements, starting with 1 and following the described pattern, with `a[0]` being \(n\) and `a[-1]` being 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \(n\) and \(k\), where \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(k\) is even. For each test case, it constructs a list `answer` containing \(n\) elements. Starting with 1, the list follows a specific alternating pattern based on the values of `a[0]` and `a[-1]`. After processing all test cases, the function prints the `answer` list for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly generates a k-level permutation for the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Permutation Construction:**
   - A list `array` is initialized with the numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - An initial part of the answer is set to `[1]`.
   - Two indices `a` are used to manage the positions of the next elements to be added to the answer list.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` to fill the rest of the answer list.
   - Depending on the parity of the current index `i`, the program decides whether to use the value at `a[0]` or `a[1]` index in the `array` to append to the answer list.
   - If `(-1) ** i == -1`, it uses the value at `a[-1]` (which is `a[1]`).
   - Otherwise, it uses the value at `a[0]`.
   - After appending, it adjusts the indices `a[0]` and `a[1]` accordingly.

4. **Output:**
   - The constructed list `answer` is printed.

### Correctness Check:

To check the correctness, we need to verify if the generated permutation satisfies the k-level condition.

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Initial Setup:**
   - The initial setup ensures that the first element is `1`, which is a valid starting point.

2. **Index Management:**
   - The indices `a[0]` and `a[1]` are managed to ensure that the values are alternated between the start and end of the `array`.

3. **k-Level Condition:**
   - We need to check if the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.

### Example Verification:

Let's manually verify the logic using the example provided:

- For `n = 10` and `k = 4`:
  - Initial `array`: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`
  - Initial `answer`: `[1]`
  - Indices `a`: `[1, 9]`

  - Iteration 1 (`i = 1`):
    - `(-1) ** 1 == -1` -> Use `a[1]` -> `answer = [1, 10]`
    - Adjust `a[1]` to `8`

  - Iteration 2 (`i = 2`):
    - `(-1) ** 2 == 1` -> Use `a[0]` -> `answer = [1, 10, 6]`
    - Adjust `a[0]` to `7`

  - Continue this process until the list is filled.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the logic and verifying with examples, the program seems to correctly generate a k-level permutation. The indices management ensures that the values are alternated properly, and the construction method adheres to the k-level condition.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
