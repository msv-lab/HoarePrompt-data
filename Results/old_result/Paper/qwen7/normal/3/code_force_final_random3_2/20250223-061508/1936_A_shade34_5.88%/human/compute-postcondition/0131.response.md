Output State: **`mak` is `n`, `mak2` is `n`, `i` is 2, `pans` is either `['0', 1]` or `[0, 1]`, `s` is the string entered by the user, `n` is the input integer from the user, `s` is an input string.**

Explanation: The line `pans.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `pans`. Since `i` was initially 1, after executing this line, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The list `pans` now contains the elements it had before plus the new value of `i` (which is 1). The other variables remain unchanged.
