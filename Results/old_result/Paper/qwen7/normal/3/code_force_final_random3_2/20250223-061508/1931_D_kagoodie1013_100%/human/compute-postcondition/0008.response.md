Output State: **`count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the tuple `(num % x, num % y)` to the variable `current_key`. This does not affect the values of `count`, `r_x`, or `r_y`, but it sets `current_key` to the new tuple. Therefore, the updated state includes the assignment of `current_key`.
