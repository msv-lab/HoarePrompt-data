You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the input consists of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
        
    #State: Output State: `minn` is either `maxx` + 1, `maxx` + 2, ..., up to `maxx + n`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `mex` is a list containing either the absolute difference between each element in `arr` and `minn`, followed by `minn`, or an additional element which is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` for each iteration, and `maxx` is the maximum value between `maxx` and `abs(arr[i] - minn)` for each iteration where `abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
    #- `minn` will be at least `maxx + 1` and can be as high as `maxx + n`.
    #- `t`, `n`, and `arr` will retain their initial values.
    #- `mex` will contain all the values calculated during the loop, including the absolute differences and the values of `minn` appended when `arr[i] > 0`.
    #- `maxx` will be the highest value it was updated to during any iteration of the loop.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: `mex` will contain all the absolute differences between each element in `arr` and `minn`, starting from `minn` being `maxx + 1` up to `maxx + n`. Additionally, `minn` will be appended to `mex` for each iteration where `arr[i] > 0`, and `maxx` will be the maximum value it was updated to during any iteration of the loop.
    print()
    #This is printed: Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases internally. For each test case, it takes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function returns a valid permutation p for the given data.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
