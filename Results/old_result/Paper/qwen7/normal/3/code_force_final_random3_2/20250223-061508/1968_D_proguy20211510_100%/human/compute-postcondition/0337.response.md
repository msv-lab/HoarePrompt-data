Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `resb` will hold the highest value obtained from the loop's iterations, `ress` will be 0, `preb` will be the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `pres` will be 0, `i` will be equal to `len(pathb)`, and `curr` will be the final computed value before the loop exits. Additionally, `resb` will be greater than or equal to `ress`.

To explain this in more detail:
- `resb` retains the highest value it was updated to during any iteration of the loop.
- `ress` is reset to 0 after the loop completes because no further comparisons are made.
- `preb` accumulates the sum of all elements in `pathb` as the loop progresses.
- `pres` is reset to 0 at the start of each outer loop iteration.
- `i` will be equal to `len(pathb)` after the loop exits, indicating the last index processed.
- `curr` will be the final computed value before the loop exits, which is compared against `resb` and `ress` during each iteration.
