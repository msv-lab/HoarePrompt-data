Output State: **`count` is 0, `results` contains the value of `count`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is calculated based on the last `num` processed, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `num % y` to `r_y`. This updates the value of `r_y` but does not affect any other variables. The initial state of `count`, `results`, `r_x`, `current_key`, `residue_map`, `num`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remains unchanged.
