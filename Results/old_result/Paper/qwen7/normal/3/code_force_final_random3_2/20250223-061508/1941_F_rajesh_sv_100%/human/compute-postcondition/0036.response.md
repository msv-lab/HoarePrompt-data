Output State: **`i` is 6; `next_max_diff` is `A[6] - A[5]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `diff` (which is `A[6] - A[5]`) to `next_max_diff`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 6. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `next_max_diff` and the unchanged value of `i`.
