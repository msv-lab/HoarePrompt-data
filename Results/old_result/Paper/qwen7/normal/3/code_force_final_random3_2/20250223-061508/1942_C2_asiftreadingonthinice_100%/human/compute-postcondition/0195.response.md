Output State: **`tmp` is a list of integers, `i` is the next element in `tmp` (if it exists), `y` is decreased by `i - 1`, `ans` is increased by `i`.**

Explanation: The code `y -= i - 1` decreases the value of `y` by `i - 1`. The value of `ans` is increased by `i`, which is the same as in the initial state. The variables `tmp` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
