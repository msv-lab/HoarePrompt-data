Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of the list `arr`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt` + 1 if `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, and `cnt` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The other variables (`arr`, `i`, `ans`, and `val`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for updating `ans` (if `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`) remains the same, but now `cnt` has been incremented by 1.
