Output State: **`cliquess[left + i]' is set to the value of `clique', and `arr[left + i]' is equal to `small_element + i'.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `arr[left + i]` to `small_element + i`. It does not affect the value of `cliquess[left + i]`, which remains set to the value of `clique`. Therefore, the output state maintains the initial conditions for `cliquess[left + i]` and updates `arr[left + i]` accordingly.
