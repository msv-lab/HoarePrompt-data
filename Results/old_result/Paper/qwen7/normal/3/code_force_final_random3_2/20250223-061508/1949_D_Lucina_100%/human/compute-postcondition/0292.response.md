Output State: **`i` is less than `4`, `n` is `3`, `nx` is either `'SF'` or `'FS'`, `j` is `2`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` concatenates the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Given that `j` is `2`, `xx[i][j - 1]` refers to `xx[i][1]`. Since `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`, it can be either `'S'` or `'F'`. Therefore, `nx` will become either `'SF'` or `'FS'`, depending on the original value of `nx` (which could be either `'S'` or `'F'`). All other variables remain unchanged.
