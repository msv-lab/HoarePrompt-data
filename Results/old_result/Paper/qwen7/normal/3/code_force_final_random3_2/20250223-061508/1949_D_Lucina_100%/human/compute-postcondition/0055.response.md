Output State: **`x` is a list of characters, `j` is previous_j + 1, `n` is such that previous_j + 1 <= n, and the character at x[previous_j] must be either 'F' or 'S'; `a[j]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. The value of `j` is `previous_j + 1`, and the conditions regarding `n` and the character at `x[previous_j]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `a[j]`.
