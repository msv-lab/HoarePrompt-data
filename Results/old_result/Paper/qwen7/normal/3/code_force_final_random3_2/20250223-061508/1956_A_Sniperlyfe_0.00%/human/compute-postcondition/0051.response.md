Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases (controlled by `t`). For each test case, it reads two positive integers `k` and `q`, followed by a list `p` of `k` distinct positive integers and a list `qs` of `q` positive integers. It then applies another function `func_1` to each element in `qs` using the corresponding `p`, storing the results in a list `res`. Finally, it prints each element of `res` after processing all elements in `qs` for all test cases. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints a list of results based on the input lists `p` and `qs`.**
