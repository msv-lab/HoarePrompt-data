Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the game logic. The solution checks if `1` is in the list of piles and prints "Bob" if it is found, otherwise it prints "Alice". However, this logic does not account for the optimal strategy of the game.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to use the concept of Nim-sum (bitwise XOR of all pile sizes). According to the Nim game theory, if the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is zero, the position is losing; otherwise, it is winning.

Hereâ€™s how you can modify the function to correctly determine the winner:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nim_sum = 0
        for pile in l:
            nim_sum ^= pile
        if nim_sum == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This code calculates the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and determines the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or not.
