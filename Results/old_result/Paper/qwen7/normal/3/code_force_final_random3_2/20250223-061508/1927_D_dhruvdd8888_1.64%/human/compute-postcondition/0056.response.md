Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `N` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is `N + 1`.
   - `s` is `N`.
   - `num` is equal to `nums[N]`.
   - `arr` is a list of tuples starting from `(2, 0, nums[0])`, followed by `(1, 1, nums[0])`, and ending with a tuple `(1 + s, N, num)`.
   - `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one.
   - `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting it to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - `eli` is the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`.
   - `s` is `N`.
   - `e` is less than `N`.
   - `_` is updated to the value of `arr[min(eli, LA)][2]`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(s, e + 1)`.

3. **Determining the Values:**
   - From the initial state, we know `s` is `N`.
   - We also know `e` is less than `N`, but the exact value of `e` is not specified. Therefore, we can only say `e` is some integer less than `N`.
   - Thus, `e + 1` will be an integer between `1` and `N` (inclusive).

4. **Final Output:**
   - Given the above, the print statement will output `N` and `e + 1`, where `N` is the non-negative integer and `e + 1` is an integer between `1` and `N`.

Output: **N, e + 1 (where N is the non-negative integer and e is an integer less than N)**
