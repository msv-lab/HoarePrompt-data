State: **`t` must be greater than 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t` and the range function.
2. For the loop to execute, the range function needs to generate at least one iteration.
3. The range function `range(t)` will generate `t` iterations if `t` is greater than 0.
4. Therefore, the state of `t` needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `t` must be greater than 0.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.
