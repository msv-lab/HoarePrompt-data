Postcondition: `decoded` is an empty list and `mapping` is a dictionary containing the key `'b'` with the value `'a'`. If `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged if the condition `chr(c) not in mapping.values()` is true.
