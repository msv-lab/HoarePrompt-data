Output State: **`minn` is 1, `same` is 3, `i` is less than `len(ar)`, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 4.**

Explanation: The variable `same` was incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables (`minn` and `i`) and their conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `minn` is still 1, `same` is now 3, `i` is still less than `len(ar)`, and `len(ar)` must still be greater than 4.
