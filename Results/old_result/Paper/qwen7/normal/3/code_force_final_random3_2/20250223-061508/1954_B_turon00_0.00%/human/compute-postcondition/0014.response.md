Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list, `tmp` is an integer, and `cnt` is equal to `cnt` + 1.**

The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since the initial value of `cnt` was not specified, we only know that `cnt` has been incremented by 1. All other variables (`a`, `i`, and `tmp`) remain unchanged.
