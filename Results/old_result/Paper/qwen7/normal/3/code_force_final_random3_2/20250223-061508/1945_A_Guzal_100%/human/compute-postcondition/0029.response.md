Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user, `k` is `a + (b + c) / 3`**.

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated by adding `a + (b + c) // 3` to its current value, which was 0. Here, `(b + c) // 3` performs integer division, meaning it rounds down to the nearest whole number. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user, their sum divided by 3 and then rounded down will also be an integer. Therefore, `k` is now equal to `a + (b + c) // 3`. The other variables remain unchanged.
