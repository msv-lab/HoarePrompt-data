Output State: **`same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `minn` is infinity**

Explanation: The line `minn = inf` initializes the variable `minn` with the value `inf` (which represents infinity). This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables (`same`, `num`, `i`, `t`, `n`). Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
