Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be at least 3**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change the values of any variables. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any previously printed data is actually outputted. Since no variables are modified, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
