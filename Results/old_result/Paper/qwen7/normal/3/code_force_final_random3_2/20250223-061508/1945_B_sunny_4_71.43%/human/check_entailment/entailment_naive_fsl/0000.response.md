Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. Specifically, the logic used to determine the number of fireworks from each installation is flawed. 

The variables `A` and `B` represent the number of fireworks launched by the first and second installations within the visibility period `m`, respectively. However, the calculation does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations, which is crucial for determining the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

For example, consider the input `(a=6, b=7, m=4)`. According to the problem description, the first installation launches fireworks at times `[6, 12, 18, 24, ...]` and the second installation at times `[7, 14, 21, 28, ...]`. Within the visibility period of 4 minutes, the first installation launches fireworks at `t=6` and `t=12`, and the second installation at `t=7`. These fireworks will overlap in the sky for one minute, making a total of 2 fireworks visible simultaneously. However, the program incorrectly calculates `A + B = 2 + 2 = 4`, which is not the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

To fix this, the program needs to account for the overlap between the two sequences of launch times. This requires a more complex algorithm that considers the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` to properly calculate the number of overlapping fireworks.
