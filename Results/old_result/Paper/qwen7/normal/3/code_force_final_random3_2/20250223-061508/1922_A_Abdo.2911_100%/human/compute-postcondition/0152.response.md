Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0.**

The code simply reassigns the variable `possible` to `True`, which does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `t` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 0 and `t` must be greater than 0 also remains valid.
