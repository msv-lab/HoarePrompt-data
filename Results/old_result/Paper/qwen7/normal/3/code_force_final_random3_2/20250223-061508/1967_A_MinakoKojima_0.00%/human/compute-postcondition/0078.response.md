Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i - 1]) - (m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i - 1])) - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `a[i]` is `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i - 1]) - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`**

Explanation: The code `k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` subtracts the value of `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` from `k`. Here, `i` was initially `n - 1`, so after the subtraction, `i` becomes `n - 2`. The value of `k` is updated accordingly. The values of `ans` and `a[i]` remain unchanged. The expression for `k` is updated to reflect the subtraction operation.
