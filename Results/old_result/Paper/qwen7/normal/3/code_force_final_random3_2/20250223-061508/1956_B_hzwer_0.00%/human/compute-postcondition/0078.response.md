Output State: **`dp[i][j]` is calculated as the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`; `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n - 1`, and the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is greater than 1.**

This means that the value of `dp[i][j]` is determined by taking the maximum of three expressions: `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
