Postcondition: **`operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input and has been fully processed, `rev_val` is a list containing all the reversed strings of elements from `operational_list` that do not have the same length when reversed, sorted in ascending order, `rev_res` is a string that contains all the elements from `operational_list` whose reversed strings have the same length as the original strings, concatenated together, `list_len` retains its initial value, which is the length of the first element in `operational_list`, `max_power` retains its initial value, which is the integer value of the second element in `operational_list`, `y` remains equal to the integer value of the input provided. If `x` is even, `x` is incremented by 1 and `val_in` is the integer value of the `(x - 1)`-th element in `rev_val`. Otherwise, `x` is 0, `val_in` is the value of `rev_val[0]`, and `rev_res` is updated by adding the reverse of `val_in`.**
