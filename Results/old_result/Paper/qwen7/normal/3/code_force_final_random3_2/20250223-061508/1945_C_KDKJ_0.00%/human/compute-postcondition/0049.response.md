The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `left` is `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is `S[1][0] + S[1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`, `ans` is 0, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]`.**
