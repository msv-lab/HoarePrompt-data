Output State: **`flag` is 0, `i` is less than 29, `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 elements where the element at index `i` is now '-1', `nalla` is 31.**

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '-1'` changes the element at index `i` in the list `s` to '-1'. The values of `flag`, `i`, `length`, and `nalla` remain unchanged from their initial states.
