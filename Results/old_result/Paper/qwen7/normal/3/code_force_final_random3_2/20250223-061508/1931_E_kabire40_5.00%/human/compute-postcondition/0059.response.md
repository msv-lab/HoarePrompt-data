Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the first value from input split by space, `max_power` is the second value from input split by space, and `y` is equal to `int(input())`.**

Explanation: The code `operational_list = input().split()` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `operational_list`. The other variables (`rev_val`, `rev_res`, `list_len`, `max_power`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
