Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

# Annotated Functions:
from math import ceil

testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    func_1(n, k)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 40, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * n, and the function `make_array` is defined elsewhere to fill the array `arr` based on the specified parameters.
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
        
    #State: i is cliques; cliques is ceil(n / k); the array is made with values [cliquess[i-1], min(cliquess[i], n - 1), i + 1].
    print(*arr)
    #This is printed: cliques[i-1] min(cliques[i], n - 1) i + 1
    print(cliques)
    #This is printed: ceil(n / k)
    print(*cliquess)
    #This is printed: C C min(C, n - 1) i + 1 (where C is ceil(n / k))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 40 inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 2*n inclusive. It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)` and fills an array `arr` using the `make_array` function based on the calculated cliques. The function then prints the filled array `arr`, the number of cliques, and another array `cliquess` containing the clique sizes.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, and clique is an integer representing the clique identifier.
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + i] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: All elements in the array `arr` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are set to values ranging from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`. The corresponding elements in the `cliquess` array are all set to the value of `clique`.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: All elements in the array `arr` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` are set to values ranging from `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` to `big_element - 1`. The corresponding elements in the `cliquess` array are all set to the value of `clique - (not_mid - 1)` to `clique`.
    #
    #In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `arr` array will have its elements from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` filled with values starting from `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` and decrementing by 1 until `big_element - 1`. Similarly, the `cliquess` array will have its elements from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` set to values starting from `clique - (not_mid - 1)` and decrementing by 1 until `clique`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It modifies an array `arr` and another array `cliquess` such that the subarray of `arr` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` contains values ranging from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`, and the subarray from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` contains values ranging from `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` to `big_element - 1`. Correspondingly, the subarray of `cliquess` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` is set to `clique`, and the subarray from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` is set to `clique - (not_mid - 1)`.
