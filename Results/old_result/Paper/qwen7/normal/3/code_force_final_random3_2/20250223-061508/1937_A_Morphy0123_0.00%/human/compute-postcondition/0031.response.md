Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `power < log2(n)`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `power` is 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.

3. **Determine the adjustment needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `power < log2(n)` must be true.
   - Currently, `power` is 3. To satisfy the condition, `log2(n)` must be greater than 3.
   - We know that \( \log_2(8) = 3 \), so for `log2(n) > 3`, `n` must be greater than 8.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`.
   - Since `power` is fixed at 3 (it cannot change within this context), we need to ensure that `n` is such that `log2(n) > 3`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 8.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`power` is 3, `n` must be greater than 8**
