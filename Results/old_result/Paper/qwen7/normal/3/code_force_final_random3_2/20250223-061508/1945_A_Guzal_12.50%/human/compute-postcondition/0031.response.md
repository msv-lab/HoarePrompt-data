Output State: **`i` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1**.

Explanation: Initially, `k` is calculated as `a + (b + c) // 3`. After executing `k += 1`, `k` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. The values of `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
