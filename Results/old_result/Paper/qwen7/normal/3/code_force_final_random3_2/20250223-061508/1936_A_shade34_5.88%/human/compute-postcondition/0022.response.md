Output State: **The final value of `mak` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and the loop has executed `n-1` times.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `mak` will hold the value `n-1`, and `i` will also be `n-1`. The variable `n` must initially be greater than 1 for the loop to run at all. The loop runs from `i=1` to `i=n-1`, so it will execute `n-1` times in total.
