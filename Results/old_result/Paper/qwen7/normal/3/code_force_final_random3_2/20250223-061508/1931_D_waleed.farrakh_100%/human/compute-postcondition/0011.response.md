Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers assigned the values from the split data at index `idx`.**

Explanation: The code `n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())` splits the string at index `idx` in the list `data` into substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns these integers to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. The variable `t` is updated to `t - 1` based on the initial state provided.
