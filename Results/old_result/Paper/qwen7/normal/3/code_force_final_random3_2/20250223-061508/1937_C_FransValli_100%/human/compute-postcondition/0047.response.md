Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `arr` is either `[i+1]` or `[0, i+1, i+1]`.
   - `n` is at least `i + 2`.
   - `maxi` is 0.
   - `res` is the input string from the user.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

Given the initial state:
- `maxi` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `arr[0]` will depend on the value of `i`:
  - If `arr` is `[i+1]`, then `arr[0]` is `i+1`.
  - If `arr` is `[0, i+1, i+1]`, then `arr[0]` is `0`.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we need to consider both possibilities:
- If `arr` is `[i+1]`, then `arr[0]` is `i+1`.
- If `arr` is `[0, i+1, i+1]`, then `arr[0]` is `0`.

However, since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can only describe the possible outputs based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the print statement will output one of the following:
- If `arr` is `[i+1]`, the output will be: `? 0 i+1 0 i`
- If `arr` is `[0, i+1, i+1]`, the output will be: `? 0 0 0 i`

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we need to provide the most precise description possible.

Output: **? 0 [i+1] 0 i** or **? 0 0 0 i**
