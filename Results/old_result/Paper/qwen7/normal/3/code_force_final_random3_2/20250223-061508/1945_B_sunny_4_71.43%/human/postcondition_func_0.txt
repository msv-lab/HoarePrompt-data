The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) (where \(1 \leq a, b, m \leq 10^{18}\)). For each test case, it calculates two values \(A\) and \(B\) as \(A = \text{int}(m / a) + 1\) and \(B = \text{int}(m / b) + 1\). It then prints the sum \(A + B\). After processing all test cases, the function outputs the sum \(A + B\) from the last test case and terminates, leaving no further operations on the input variables.
