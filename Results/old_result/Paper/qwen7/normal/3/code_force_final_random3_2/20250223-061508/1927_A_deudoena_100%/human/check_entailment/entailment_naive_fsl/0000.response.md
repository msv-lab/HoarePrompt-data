Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
3
6
BWWBWW
```

The expected output is `2`, because painting the segment from the 2nd to the 3rd cell ("WW") will turn all cells white. However, the program incorrectly outputs `4`.

The issue lies in how the program determines the minimum length. It finds the first black cell from the start (`mi`) and the last black cell from the end (`ma`), but it adds 2 to the difference between these indices without checking if there are any black cells in between. This can lead to incorrect results, as shown in the counterexample.
