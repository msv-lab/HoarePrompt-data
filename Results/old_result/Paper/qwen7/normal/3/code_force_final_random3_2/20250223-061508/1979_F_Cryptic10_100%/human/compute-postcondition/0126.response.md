Output State: **`ops` is unchanged except the last tuple which now has its first element appended with the new `v1` value; `v1` is the first element of the second tuple in the reversed `ops` list; `v2` is the second element of the second tuple in the reversed `ops` list; the last tuple in `ops` has its first element appended with `v1`.**

Explanation: The code checks if the last element of the last tuple in `ops` is equal to `v2`. If true, it appends `v1` to the first element of the last tuple in `ops`. Otherwise, it appends `v1` to the first element of the first tuple in `ops`. However, since the condition `p1[-1] == v2` is not specified to be true, `v1` is appended to the first element of the last tuple in `ops`. The values of `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged from their previous states.
