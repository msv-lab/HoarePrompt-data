You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

- Function Summary: 
The function constructs a tree from given edge connections and determines whether a specified node traversal path requires an odd or even number of moves. If the total number of moves is odd, it prints 'Ron'; otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly initializes `t` to 1.
   - It reads the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t`, but since `t` is always 1, this part is fine.
   - It reads the edges of the tree and constructs an adjacency list `nodes`.
   - It identifies the two leaf nodes (`ends`).

2. **Constructing the Path:**
   - The program constructs a path from one leaf node to the other. This is done by traversing the tree starting from one leaf node and ending at the other leaf node. This part seems correct as long as the tree structure is valid.

3. **Determining the Starting Node:**
   - The program reads the starting node `start` for the current round.
   - It finds the index of the starting node within the constructed path `tree`.

4. **Calculating Moves:**
   - The program calculates the distance to the start node from the beginning (`idx`) and from the end (`n - idx - 1`).
   - These distances represent the number of moves required to reach the start node from the beginning and the end of the path, respectively.

5. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if any of these distances is odd. If so, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.
   - This logic is based on the fact that the player making the last move wins. Since the total number of moves is the sum of these distances, if the sum is even, Hermione wins; if odd, Ron wins.

### Verification of Correctness:

- **Tree Construction:** The construction of the path from one leaf to the other is correct as long as the tree is valid.
- **Distance Calculation:** The calculation of distances to the start node from both ends of the path is correct.
- **Winning Condition:** The logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total moves is correct.

Given that the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code align with the problem statement, the program appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
