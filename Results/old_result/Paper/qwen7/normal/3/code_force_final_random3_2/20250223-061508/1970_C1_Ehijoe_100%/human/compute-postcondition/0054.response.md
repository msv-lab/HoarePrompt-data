Output State: **`prev` is equal to `curr`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `tree` is a list containing `s`, `curr`, and `curr` is `nodes[curr][0]`, and `prev` is now equal to `nodes[curr][0]`**.

Explanation: The code `curr = nodes[curr][0]` updates the value of `curr` to the first element of the sublist `nodes[curr]`. Since `prev` was previously equal to `curr`, `prev` is also updated to `nodes[curr][0]`. The values of `s`, `e`, `tree`, and the initial value of `curr` remain unchanged.
