Output State: The loop will have executed for all iterations, meaning `j` will start from `n-1` and decrement until it reaches `-1`. After all iterations, `dp[i][j]` will hold the maximum value calculated for each cell in the `dp` table based on the conditions provided within the loop. Specifically, for each cell `dp[i][j]`, the value will be determined as follows:

- If `j + 1` does not appear in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` will be set to `dp[i + 1][j]`.
- If `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` will be set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.
- If `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` will be set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.

This final state represents the optimal solution for the problem being solved by the loop, where `dp[i][j]` contains the maximum possible value that can be achieved starting from index `i` with the given constraints on the `cards` list.
