Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `inp` is the same list as before, `a` is the next element in `inp`, `x` is equal to either the next element in `inp` (let's call it `a_new`) or `a` depending on the condition `a <= x`, `y` is equal to `a`, `ans` is `ans + 1`, and `y` is now equal to `a` if `a <= y`.**

The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
