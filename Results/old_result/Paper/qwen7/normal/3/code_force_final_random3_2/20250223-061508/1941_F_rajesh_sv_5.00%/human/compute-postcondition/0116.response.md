Output State: **`mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is equal to `l` + (`h` - `l`) // 2, `l` is `mid + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to be `mid + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` retain their original values, `mid` remains as `l` + (`h` - `l`) // 2, and `l` is updated to `mid + 1`.
