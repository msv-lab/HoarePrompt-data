Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining whether it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The issue lies in the function `func_1()`, where the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is used to check if it's possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. This condition is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of removing cubes.

To fix this, the condition should be simplified to just `(n - m) % 2 == 0` without the additional `n - m >= 0` part. This is because:
- If `n` is the total number of moves and `m` is the final number of cubes, then the difference between `n` and `m` must be even for it to be possible to add and remove cubes in such a way that the final count is `m`.
- The value of `n - m` being non-negative is inherently true since `n` is always at least `m` (it can be equal to `m` if no removals occur).

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This corrected version will correctly determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
