The `while True` loop does not have any conditions based on external variables like `i` or `n`. Instead, it will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Given that the loop is `while True`, it can certainly execute one more time without any adjustments to the loop head variables.

Therefore, no changes are needed to the states of the variables mentioned in the problem statement.

State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb - 1` set to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is now the value of `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `curr` is `pres + paths[length_of_paths] * (k - length_of_paths)`, `ress` is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `[a[pb - 1]]`, `paths` is an empty list, and the element at index `pb - 1` of `vis` is equal to 1.**
