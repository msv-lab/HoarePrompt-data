Based on the initial state provided, the value of `count` depends on the comparison between `s[k]` and `s[k + j]`. However, since the specific values of `s`, `k`, and `j` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `count`.

Given the conditions:
- If `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, or
- If either `s[k]` or `s[k + j]` is a '?',
then `count` is increased by 1.

Otherwise, `count` remains 0.

Since we do not have the actual values of `s`, `k`, and `j`, we cannot determine the exact value of `count`. Therefore, the expression `count * 2` will also depend on the same conditions.

Output: **count * 2 (where count is determined by the conditions described)**
