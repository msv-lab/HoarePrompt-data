You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and each test case consists of two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if ((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and either `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`, or `(n - m) % 2 != 0` or `n - m < 0`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a test case consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 100 \)) and prints 'Yes' if \( (n - m) \) is even and non-negative, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but modifies the output based on the condition.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is less than `m`. According to the problem description, Nikita can only add or remove exactly one cube per move. Therefore, the difference between `n` and `m` must be even and non-negative for it to be possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves. However, the current implementation only checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`, which is not sufficient. 

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `m = 4`. In this case, `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is true, but it is impossible to end up with 4 cubes after 2 moves because Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move. Thus, the program incorrectly outputs "Yes" for this case.

To fix this, the condition should also check if `n >= m`. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

With this correction, the program will correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement.
