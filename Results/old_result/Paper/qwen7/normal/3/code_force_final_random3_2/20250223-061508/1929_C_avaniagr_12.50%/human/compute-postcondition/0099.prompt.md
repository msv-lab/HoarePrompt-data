Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x < k - 1:
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif x == k - 1:
        if a >= x + 3:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        z = 0
        for i in range(x + 1):
            z += z // (k - 1) + 1
        if a >= z:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers. If `x` is less than `k - 1`:
- If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, then `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 1`.
Otherwise (`x` equals `k - 1`):
- If the first element of `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, the first element of `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the length of `a` is less than `x + 3`.
Otherwise (`x` does not equal `k - 1`):
- `i` equals `x`, `x` remains greater than `k - 1` and at least 2, and `z` equals `2^x - 1`.
- If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is less than `z`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` are integers. If `x` is less than `k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 1`, then no changes are made to `k`, `x`, `a`, or `t`. If `x` equals `k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, then no changes are made to `k`, `x`, `a`, or `t`. Otherwise, `x` is a non-negative integer, `z` is the sum of `z` initialized to 0 plus the value of `z // (k - 1) + 1` added for each iteration from 0 to `x`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `z` if the if condition is true, and `a` is less than `z` if the else condition is true.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is `t - 1`, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and `z` is 8. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, `z` remains 8. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, no changes are made. If `x` is greater than `k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, no changes are made. If `x` is greater than `k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 1`, `z` remains 8.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
