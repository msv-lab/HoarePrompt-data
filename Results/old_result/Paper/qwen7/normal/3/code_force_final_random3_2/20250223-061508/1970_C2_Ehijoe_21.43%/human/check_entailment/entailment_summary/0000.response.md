Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves a game played on a tree where Ron and Hermione take turns moving a stone from one node to an adjacent inactive node. The player who cannot make a move loses. The game is played for a fixed number of rounds, and the starting node for each round is given. The goal is to determine the winner of each round based on optimal play.

2. **Analysis of Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the shortest path lengths from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree. It uses a recursive approach to traverse the tree and build a list of distances.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the starting node is a leaf node, returning `[0]` since there are no other nodes to reach.

3. **Analysis of Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input for the tree and the starting nodes for each round.
   - It constructs the adjacency list representation of the tree.
   - It identifies all leaf nodes and stores them in a deque.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the list of distances from the starting node to all other nodes.
   - It checks if any of these distances are odd. If at least one distance is odd, it means Ron can force a win because he can always make a move that leaves Hermione with an even number of moves, forcing her into a losing position eventually.
   - If all distances are even, Hermione can force a win using a similar strategy.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the game rules and the winning condition based on the parity of the distances.
   - The function handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of each round based on the parity of the distances calculated by `func_1`.

Correctness: **True**
