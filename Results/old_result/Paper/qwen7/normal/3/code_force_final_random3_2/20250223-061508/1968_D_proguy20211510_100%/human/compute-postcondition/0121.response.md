Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb - 1` set to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `ps` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `curr` is `pres + paths[length_of_paths] * (k - length_of_paths)`, `ress` is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the list `vis` has had its element at index `pb - 1` set to 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
