Reasoning:
The annotated program logic needs to be carefully analyzed to ensure it correctly finds the integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) that maximizes the expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `results` is initialized as an empty list to store the results for each test case.
   - The function iterates over each \( x \) in `test_cases`.

2. **Finding the Best \( y \)**:
   - For each \( x \), `max_sum` is initialized to 0.
   - `best_y` is set to 1 initially.
   - The inner loop iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 1 to find the \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
   - If a better \( y \) is found (i.e., \(\gcd(x, y) + y > \max_sum\)), it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to this new \( y \). The loop breaks immediately after finding the first such \( y \).

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the function returns the list of `best_y` values.

However, the state comment at the end of the function indicates an issue:
- It states that `results` contains `[1, 1, 1]` after processing all test cases, which is incorrect. The correct output should vary based on the input values of `x`.

To verify correctness, consider the example inputs:
- For \( x = 10 \): The optimal \( y \) is 5 because \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\).
- For \( x = 7 \): The optimal \( y \) is 6 because \(\gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7\).
- For \( x = 21 \): The optimal \( y \) is 18 because \(\gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 3 + 18 = 21\).

Given these examples, the function should not always return 1 as the best \( y \). Instead, it should correctly identify the \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

Therefore, the provided function does not correctly solve the problem as intended.

Correctness: **False**
