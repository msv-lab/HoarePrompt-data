Output State: **`i` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated by adding `a + (b + c) // 3` to its current value. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, their specific values are not known, but the expression `a + (b + c) // 3` accurately represents the new value of `k`. The other variables (`i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) remain unchanged.
