Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation for `bxsfory`**:
   - The calculation `math.ceil(y / 2)` is not appropriate. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, we need to consider the total number of cells occupied by these icons. The correct way would be to calculate how many full 2x2 icons fit into the grid and then adjust the remaining space for 1x1 icons.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Space**:
   - The logic for handling the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons is flawed. The current implementation subtracts `y * 4` from `x`, which is incorrect. Instead, we should calculate how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons.

3. **Incorrect Calculation for `x`**:
   - The expression `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. We should calculate the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons and then see how many 1x1 icons can fit into that space.

4. **Incorrect Calculation for `bxsfory1`**:
   - The calculation `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` is incorrect because it doesn't account for the correct number of 1x1 icons that can fit into the remaining space.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function `func_2`:

```python
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    # Calculate the number of 2x2 icons that can fit
    num_2x2_icons = min(y, (5 * 3) // 4)
    y -= num_2x2_icons
    # Calculate the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
    remaining_space = (5 * 3) - (num_2x2_icons * 4)
    # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit into the remaining space
    num_1x1_icons = min(x, remaining_space)
    x -= num_1x1_icons
    # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons
    additional_screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil(x / 15)
    # Total screens needed
    total_screens = num_2x2_icons + additional_screens_for_1x1
    print(total_screens)
```

This corrected function should provide the right solution for the problem.
