Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the optimal position `i` to place the road such that at least half of the residents on both sides of the road are satisfied.
2. The solution uses a prefix sum approach to keep track of the counts of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides as the road is placed at different positions.
3. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the prefix sums and iterates through all possible positions to find the optimal `i` that minimizes the absolute difference from `n/2` while satisfying the conditions.
4. The function `func_2` correctly calls `func_1` for each test case.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic and implementation appear to be correct. The program handles all the necessary steps to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
