You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` will be 0, `k` will be 0, and `nums` will be a list where each element is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` for the indices where the loop executed, and 0 otherwise.
    #
    #To understand this, let's break it down:
    #
    #- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
    #- For each iteration, `nums[i]` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
    #- Then, `k` is decreased by `nums[i]`.
    #
    #Since `k` starts as some positive value and is decreased by a value that depends on its bit length, eventually `k` will become 0 after enough iterations. When `k` reaches 0, the subtraction operation will no longer change `k`, and since `n` is decremented with each iteration, `n` will also reach 0.
    #
    #Each time through the loop, `nums[i]` is set to a value based on the current bit length of `k`. As `k` decreases, the bit length of `k` decreases, and thus the value of `nums[i]` will be adjusted accordingly. By the end of the loop, `nums` will contain the sequence of values that were assigned to it during the iterations, and `k` will be 0.
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` where each element is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` for the indices where the loop executed, and 0 otherwise, and the last element of `nums` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer within the range [1, 2 * 10^5], and `k` is an integer within the range [1, 10^9]. The function returns a list `nums` where each element is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` for the indices where the loop executed, and 0 otherwise, with the last element of `nums` being 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `nums` where each element is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` for the indices where the loop executed, and 0 otherwise, and the last element of `nums` is 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
