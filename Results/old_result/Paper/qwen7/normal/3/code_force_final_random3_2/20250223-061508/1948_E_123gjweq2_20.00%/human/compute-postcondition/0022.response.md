Output State: **`i` is 3, `not_mid` is greater than 0, `cliquess[left + mid + 1]` is equal to `clique`, `arr[left + mid + 1]` is equal to `big_element - 1`, `cliquess[left + mid + 3]` is equal to `clique - 2`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `arr[left + mid + i]` to `big_element - i`. Given that `i` is initially 3, the updated value of `arr[left + mid + 3]` becomes `big_element - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
