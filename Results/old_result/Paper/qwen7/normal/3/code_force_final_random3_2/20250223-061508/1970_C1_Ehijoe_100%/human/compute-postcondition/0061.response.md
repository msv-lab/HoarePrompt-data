Output State: **`prev` is equal to `nodes[curr][1]`, `curr` is `nodes[curr][1]`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `curr` is not equal to `e`, `tree` now includes `curr` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `prev = curr` updates the value of `prev` to be the same as the current value of `curr`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `prev` is now equal to `nodes[curr][1]`, and `curr` remains as `nodes[curr][1]`. The conditions regarding `s`, `e`, and `tree` remain the same as they were not affected by the code.
