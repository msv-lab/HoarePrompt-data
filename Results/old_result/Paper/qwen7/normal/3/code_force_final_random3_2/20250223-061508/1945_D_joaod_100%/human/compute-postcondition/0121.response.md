Output State: **`na_frente` is `na_frente - 2`, `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the subsequent input split and converted to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the current input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The line `pos_final -= 1` decrements the value of `pos_final` by 1. The other variables (`na_frente`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
