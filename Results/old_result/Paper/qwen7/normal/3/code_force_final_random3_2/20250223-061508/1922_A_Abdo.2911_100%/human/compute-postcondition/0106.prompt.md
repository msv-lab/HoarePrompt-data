Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `possible` is False, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, the value of `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, while the elements from index `i` onwards will retain their original values, and `t` must be greater than 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        if c[i] != a[i]:
            possible = True
            break
    elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
        continue
    else:
        possible = True
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is True if `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, while the elements from index `i` onwards will retain their original values, and `t` must be greater than 0. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, `possible` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is True if `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, the elements from index `i` onwards will retain their original values, and `t` must be greater than 0. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, `possible` remains True. If `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` remains True, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0, and the program either continues the loop if `c[i]` equals `a[i]` or `b[i]`, or breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `c[i]` does not equal `a[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
