Output State: All elements in `operational_list` have been processed. `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of each element in `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string does not match the original string's length. `rev_res` is a string that contains the sum (concatenated as strings) of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed length matches the original length.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `operational_list` will be empty, `rev_val` will contain the reverses of all elements that did not meet the length condition, and `rev_res` will be a concatenated string of all elements that met the length condition when reversed.
