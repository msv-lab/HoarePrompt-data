Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in a:`. The objects involved here are `x` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `x` will take on each value from the list `a` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in the list `a`. Once `a` is empty, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `x` will take on each value from `a`, we don't need to adjust `x` directly; its value will be determined by the current iteration.
   - We need to ensure that `a` is not empty for the loop to execute. Therefore, `a` must contain at least one element.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `a` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `cnt` is an empty dictionary**
