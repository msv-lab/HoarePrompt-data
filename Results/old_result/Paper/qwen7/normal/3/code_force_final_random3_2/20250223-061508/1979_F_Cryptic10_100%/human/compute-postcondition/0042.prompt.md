Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `p1` is a list containing the two elements of `vx`, `p2` is an empty list, `t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, both of which are integers from 1 to `t-2`, `ops` is a list containing tuples where either `(v1, v2)` or `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are included, and the length of `ops` is equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ops` contains valid tuples, the length of `ops` matches the number of iterations, the last tuple's first element is `v1`, the last tuple's second element is `v2`, and the list within the last tuple is appended with `v1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ops` contains valid tuples, the length of `ops` is one less than before, the last tuple's first element is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list, the last tuple's second element is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list, and the list within the last tuple is the list from the second-to-last tuple without the appended `v1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ops` contains valid tuples, the length of `ops` is one less than before, the last tuple's first element is the first element of the third-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list, the last tuple's second element is the second element of the third-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list, and the list within the last tuple is the list from the third-to-last tuple without the appended `v1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
