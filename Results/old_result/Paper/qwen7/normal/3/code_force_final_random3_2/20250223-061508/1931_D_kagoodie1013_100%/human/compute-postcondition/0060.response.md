Output State: **`count` is 0 plus the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `current_key` having a value of 1 more than its previous value, `num` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `r_y` to be `num % y`. All other variables remain unchanged. The updated value of `r_y` is used in the subsequent operations, but the initial state of the other variables is preserved.
