Output State: **`bm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[b] * k + bp`; `sm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 0; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `sp` is increased by `a[s]`.**

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` increases the value of `sp` by `a[s]`. The other variables (`bm`, `sm`, `n`, `k`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
