Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far.
   - `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference or remains unchanged.
   - `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs or remains `None`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`.

3. **Understand the Loop Body Logic**:
   - If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff`, and `index` is set to `i`.
   - Otherwise, `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff`.

4. **Determine the New Values for the Loop Variables**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be 3.

5. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - Therefore, `n` must remain the same for the next iteration.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` remain unchanged unless the conditions inside the loop body are met, but since we are only adjusting the loop head states, these values remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference or remains unchanged, `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs or remains None, `i` is 3, and `n` is the same as before.**
