Output State: **Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; if `s` is '0', then `x` is equal to the last element of the list `S`[0] plus 1 and `y` is equal to the last element of the list `S`[1]; otherwise, `x` is equal to the last element of the list `S`[0] and `y` is equal to the last element of the list `S`[1] plus 1; `S` is now `[S[0], S[1], [x, y]]`.**

Explanation: The code `S.append([x, y])` adds the list `[x, y]` to the end of the list `S`. Since the postcondition specifies the values of `x` and `y` based on the value of `s`, these values remain unchanged. The length and content of `a` also remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new list `[x, y]` appended to `S`.
