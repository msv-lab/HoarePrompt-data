Output State: **`minn` is set to infinity, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `same` is 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `i` to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
