The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing characters from `string`, `n` is the length of list `s`, `done` is False, and the current value of `n` is 1.**
