Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(n + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < n + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is `n - 1`
   - `q[j]` is greater than 0
   - `eta` contains the value `j`

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` is currently `n - 1`, the next value of `j` will be `n` (because the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration).
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n + 1`. Therefore, `j` must be incremented to `n`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be updated to `n`.
   - `q[j]` (which is now `q[n]`) will be checked to ensure it is still greater than 0.
   - `eta` will contain the value `n` since `eta` was previously containing `j` (which was `n - 1`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is `n`, `q[j]` is greater than 0, and `eta` contains the value `n`**.
