Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` is `False`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `string` is an input string
- `s` is a list representation of the input string
- `x` is the first element of the list `s`
- `count` is `j` (where `j` is the last index checked in the loop)
- `count2` is either `0` or `1`, depending on the conditions met during the loop execution
- `n` must be greater than `0`

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the other variables and objects mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **NO**
