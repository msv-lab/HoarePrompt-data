Output State: **`cnt` is -1**

The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^6. The given code snippet initializes `cnt` to -1. No other variables are affected by this code, so the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `cnt` and retains the initial conditions of `n` and `m`.
