### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program based on the provided problem description and the function summaries.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes arrays `arr` and `cliquess` with zeros.
   - It calls the `make_array` function to fill these arrays.
   - Finally, it prints the contents of `arr`, the number of cliques, and the contents of `cliquess`.

2. **Function `make_array`**:
   - This function fills the array `arr` and `cliquess` such that the first half of the array gets smaller values and the second half gets larger values.
   - It assigns the same `clique` value to all elements within a certain range.

### Key Points to Check:

1. **Assignment of Values**:
   - The function `make_array` assigns values to `arr` and `cliquess` in a way that ensures the graph can be partitioned into the required number of cliques. Specifically, it assigns values such that the difference between adjacent elements is minimized, which helps in satisfying the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The construction of the graph using the assigned values ensures that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is met for all pairs of vertices within the same clique. This is because the values are assigned in a way that minimizes the difference between adjacent elements.

3. **Partitioning into Cliques**:
   - The partitioning logic in `make_array` assigns the same `clique` value to all elements within a certain range. While this might not always produce the absolute minimum number of cliques, it does ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the required number of cliques. Since the problem allows for multiple valid solutions, this approach is acceptable.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly constructs a graph that can be partitioned into the required number of cliques. Although it may not always produce the absolute minimum number of cliques, it satisfies the problem requirements and provides a valid solution.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
