Reasoning:
1. The program correctly identifies transitions in the input list `nums` where the value changes.
2. It stores these transitions along with their positions in a list `arr`.
3. For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the relevant transition in the `arr` list.
4. It then checks if the transition falls within the query bounds `[l, r]`.
5. Depending on the position of the transition, it either prints the indices of the different elements or `-1, -1` if no such pair exists.
6. The logic appears to handle edge cases appropriately, such as when the transition starts at the beginning of the query range or ends before the query range.

Given the execution summary and the provided reasoning, the program seems to correctly implement the required functionality based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
