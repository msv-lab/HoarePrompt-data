Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is `j + 1` (meaning `j` was incremented by 1).
   - `eta` includes `j + 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 2`.
   - `eta` will include `j + 2` if `q[j+1]` is greater than 0.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `j` will be `j + 2`.
   - `eta` will include `j + 2` if `q[j+1]` is greater than 0.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than or equal to 0.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `j` is `j + 2`, `eta` includes `j + 2` if `q[j+1]` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0**.
