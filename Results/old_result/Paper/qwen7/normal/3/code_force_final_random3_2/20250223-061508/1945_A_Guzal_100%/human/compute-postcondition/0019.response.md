Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is updated by adding to its current value the result of `a + (b + c) // 3`. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input, `(b + c) // 3` calculates the integer division of the sum of `b` and `c` by 3. The value of `k` is thus the original value of `k` plus this computed value. All other variables remain unchanged.
