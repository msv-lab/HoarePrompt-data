Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `j`. The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0` in reverse order.

2. **Understand the Postconditions**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `j` is `n - 1`.
   - `dp[i][j]` is updated based on certain conditions involving `cards`.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop decrements `j` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from the previous value.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `dp[i][j]` will be updated according to the conditions given.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `j` will be `j + 1` (decremented by 1 from the previous value).
- `n` remains the same.
- `dp[i][j]` will be updated based on the conditions provided.

Since the loop starts with `j = n - 1` and decrements `j` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `n - 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n - 2`, and `dp[i][j]` is updated as follows: if `j + 1` does not appear in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is `dp[i + 1][j]`; if `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`; otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.**
