Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is a new input string from the user.
   - `maxi` is equal to `n-1`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `arr` is a list containing `[i]`.

4. **Analyze the loop increment**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, if `i` was `n-1` before the increment, it will become `n` after the increment.

5. **Check the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

6. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was `n-1` before, it will now be `n`.
   - To satisfy the loop condition `i < n`, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `i` will be `n` after the increment.
- For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`, so `i` must be set to `n-1` (the value just before the increment).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `res` is a new input string from the user, `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, and `arr` is a list containing `[n-1]`.**
