Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `left` is `S[0][0]`, `lsum` is `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`, and `ans` is 0. If the condition `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` is true, then `ans` remains 0. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 0, and the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`.**
