Output State: **`shapes` is 0**

The code `shapes = 0` initializes the variable `shapes` to 0. This does not affect the values of `d` or `pl`, which are described as being determined by a loop over the list `palka`. Since no operations are performed on these variables within the given code snippet, their states remain unchanged. The only change is that `shapes` is explicitly set to 0.
