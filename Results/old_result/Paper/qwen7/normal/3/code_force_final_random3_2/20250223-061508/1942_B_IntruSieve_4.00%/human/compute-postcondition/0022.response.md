Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions**:
   - `minn` is either `maxx` + 1 or equal to the current value of `maxx`.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.
   - `mex` is a list containing 0 if the condition `arr[i] > 0` is true, otherwise `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between each element in `arr` and `minn`.
   - `maxx` is updated to the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` if `abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx`. Otherwise, `maxx` remains unchanged.

3. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the current index being processed, and `n` is the total number of elements in the list `arr`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, `i` will be incremented to `i + 1` in the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of the list `arr` and does not change within the loop.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `minn`, `t`, `arr`, `mex`, and `maxx` are not directly modified by the loop itself but may be updated inside the loop body. However, since we are only adjusting the states at the start of the loop, we do not need to consider these updates yet.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are:

- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the new state is:
State: **`minn` is either `maxx` + 1 or equal to the current value of `maxx`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `mex` is a list containing 0 if the condition `arr[i] > 0` is true, otherwise `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between each element in `arr` and `minn`, and `maxx` is updated to the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` if `abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx`. Otherwise, `maxx` remains unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1.**
