Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the number of winners in a game based on the sequence `a` and the initial number of players `n`.
- The key logic is implemented in `func_1`, which reduces the number of players `n` by removing players at positions specified by `p` until no more players can be removed.
- `func_2` processes multiple test cases, reading input and calling `func_1` for each case, then printing the results.
- The execution summary of `func_1` indicates that it correctly reduces the number of players `n` according to the sequence `p` and stops when no more players can be removed.
- The execution summary of `func_2` indicates that it correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results of `func_1` for each test case.

Given the descriptions and the expected behavior, both functions seem to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
