Output State: **`rep` is 2, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Max - Min`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `Min`, `Max`, and `Max - Min`.**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `k` is set such that `k = k - Min`. Since `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)`, the value of `k` is reduced by this minimum value.
- The value of `number` is updated to `Max`, which was previously `max(int(n / k), k)`. Now, `number` becomes `Max - Min` because `number` is reassigned to `Max`.
- The list `tab` initially contains the string representations of `Min`, `Max`, and `Max`. After the code runs, `tab` still contains these string representations, but `number` is now updated to `Max - Min`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `rep` remains 2.
- `Min` remains as `min(n // k, k)`.
- `Max` remains as `max(int(n / k), k)`.
- `number` is now `Max - Min`.
- `tab` contains the string representations of `Min`, `Max`, and `Max - Min`.
