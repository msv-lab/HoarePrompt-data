Output State: **`arr` is [0, i, i], `n` is at least `i + 1`, `maxi` is 0, `res` is the input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value `i` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` is `[0, i]`. After appending `i`, `arr` becomes `[0, i, i]`. The values of `n`, `maxi`, and `res` remain unchanged.
