The function processes multiple inputs consisting of integers and strings. For each input, it counts the number of '1's in the string. Based on this count, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO'. Specifically, if the count is 0, greater than 2 and even, or exactly 2 with the next character not being '1', it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each input.
