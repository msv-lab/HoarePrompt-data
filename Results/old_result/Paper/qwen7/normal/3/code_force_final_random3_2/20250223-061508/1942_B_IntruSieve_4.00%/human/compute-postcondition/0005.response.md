Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute as long as `i < n`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if and only if `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, it will always be less than `n` as long as `n` is greater than 0.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure it is greater than 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`minn` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `mex` is an empty list, `maxx` is 0**
