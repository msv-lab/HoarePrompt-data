### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function attempts to recursively find the maximum sum of the array by splitting the array into subarrays and considering different ways to combine the results.
- The function uses dynamic programming to store intermediate results in `res_dict`.
- However, the logic inside the function does not directly relate to the problem of finding the MEX and setting the segment to this value.
- The function seems to be trying to find some kind of partitioning value, but it does not correctly handle the MEX operation or the problem constraints.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function is supposed to find the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
- It calls `func_1` to get the maximum sum and then tries to reconstruct the operations that lead to this sum.
- Similar to `func_1`, `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to find the MEX and set the segment accordingly.

#### Function `make_stairs`:
- This function is intended to create a "staircase" pattern in the array, but it does not correctly handle the MEX operation or the problem constraints.
- The function does not seem to be used in the context of solving the problem as described.

Given the above analysis, the provided functions do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. They do not handle the MEX operation or the problem constraints properly. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs` do not address the problem of maximizing the sum of the array elements through the allowed operations.
