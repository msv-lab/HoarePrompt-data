Output State: **`i` is 4, `not_c` is False, and `A` is True.**

Explanation: The variable `A` is initially `False`. The code `A = not A` changes the value of `A` to the opposite of its current value. Since `A` was `False`, after executing `A = not A`, `A` becomes `True`. The values of `i` and `not_c` remain unchanged.
