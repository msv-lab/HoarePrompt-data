Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the graph has fewer than 4 vertices. Specifically, the program assumes that the graph will always have more than 2 vertices remaining after removing (n - 2) edges, which is not always true. For example, consider a graph with 3 vertices (n = 3). In this case, the graph initially has 3 edges, and after removing (3 - 2) = 1 edge, only 2 edges remain. The program will attempt to remove another vertex, but since there are only 2 vertices left, it will fail to find a vertex with a degree of at least 2, leading to an incorrect behavior. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.
