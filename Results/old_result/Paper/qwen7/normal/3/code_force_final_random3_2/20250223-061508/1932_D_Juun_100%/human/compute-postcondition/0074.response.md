Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: `trumps` is not an empty list.
   - This means `trumps` contains at least one element.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Execution**:
   - `trumps.pop()` removes and returns the last element from the list `trumps`.
   - The result of `trumps.pop()` is concatenated with `trump` and then another space and `trumps.pop()` is performed again, and the result is concatenated with `trump`.
   - Finally, the entire string is printed.

4. **Explanation**:
   - Since `trumps` is not empty, let's denote the elements of `trumps` as `[a, b, c, ...]` where `a` is the first element, `b` is the second element, and so on.
   - When `trumps.pop()` is called the first time, it removes and returns the last element of the list, say `x`.
   - The next part of the string concatenation is `trump`, so the string becomes `xtrump`.
   - The second `trumps.pop()` removes and returns the new last element of the list, say `y`.
   - The final part of the string concatenation is `trump`, so the string becomes `xtrumpytrump`.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The final string printed will be the last element of the list followed by `trump`, a space, the second-to-last element of the list, and finally `trump`.

Given this reasoning, the output will be:

Output: **last element of trumps + trump + second-to-last element of trumps + trump**
