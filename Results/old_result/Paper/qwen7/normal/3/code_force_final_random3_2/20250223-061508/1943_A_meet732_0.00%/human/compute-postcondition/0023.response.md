Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is less than or equal to 1, and either the condition `c` is false or `j` is equal to `n`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This output state indicates that the `break` statement has been executed, which means we exit the loop or conditional block we are currently inside. The values of `j`, `n`, and `cntl[j]` remain unchanged, and the condition involving `c` and `j` also remains the same.
