Output: **2, 2 % n** 

Explanation: 
- `j` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is an input integer, but its specific value is not provided, so it remains as `n`.
- `r` is explicitly given as 0, but it is not used in the print statement.
- The expression `j % n` computes the remainder when `j` (which is 2) is divided by `n`. Since `n` is not specified, we keep it as `n`.

Therefore, the print statement will output `2` followed by the result of `2 % n`, with a space separating them.
