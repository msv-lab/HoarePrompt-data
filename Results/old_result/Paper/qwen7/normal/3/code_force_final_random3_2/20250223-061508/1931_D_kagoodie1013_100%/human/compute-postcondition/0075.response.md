Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). For each array arr in `test_cases`, the function calculates the total count of occurrences of each unique pair (r_x, r_y) and returns a list `results` containing these counts.**

This means the function processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes the size of an array, two specific indices (x and y), and the array itself. It then counts how many times each unique pair of elements at positions x and y appears across all arrays and returns these counts in a list.
