Output State: **`i` is 5, `diff` is `A[5] - A[4]`, `max_diff` is `diff`, `next_max_diff` is `max_diff`, `index` is as before, `n` must be greater than 4**.

Explanation: The line `max_diff = diff` updates the value of `max_diff` to be equal to the current value of `diff`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
