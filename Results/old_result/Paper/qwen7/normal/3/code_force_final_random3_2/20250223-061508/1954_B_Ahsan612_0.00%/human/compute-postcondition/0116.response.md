Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `ar`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `same` is either 3 or 1.
   - `num` is `ar[i]`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 2.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ar` is a list of integers.
   - The current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop condition checks if `i` is less than `len(ar)`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

Given that `i` is currently `i + 1` (from the previous iteration), for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is still within the bounds of the list `ar`.

Since `i` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

So, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to ensure it is less than `len(ar)`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`same` is either 3 or 1, `num` is `ar[i]`, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**
