Output State: **`rep` is increased by 1, `n` is reduced by `Min * Max`, `k` is adjusted by subtracting either `Max` or `Min` accordingly, `number` is either `Max` or `Min`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` appended to it, `n` is now `n - Min * Max`, `k` must be greater than zero, `rep` must be less than 60, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.**

This means that the value of `n` has been updated to `n - Min * Max`, while all other conditions and values remain as specified in the initial state.
