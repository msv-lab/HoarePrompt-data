Output State: **`card` is split into `rank` and `suit`; `trumps` and `answers` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `rank, suit = card` unpacks the tuple `card` into two variables `rank` and `suit`. This means that `card` is now effectively used to initialize these two variables. However, the initial states of `trumps` and `answers` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, they remain as they were in the initial state.
