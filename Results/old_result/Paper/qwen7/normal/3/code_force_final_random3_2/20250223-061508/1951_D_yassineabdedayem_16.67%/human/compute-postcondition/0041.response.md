Output State: **`rep` is increased by 1, `n` is reduced by `Min * Max`, `k` is adjusted by subtracting either `Max` or `Min` accordingly, `number` is either `Max` or `Min`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` appended to it, `n` is now `n - Min * Max`, `k` must be greater than zero, `rep` must be less than 60, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `rep += 1` simply increments the value of `rep` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `number`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The conditions specified in the precondition (that `k` must be greater than zero, `rep` must be less than 60, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`) also remain valid after the code execution.
