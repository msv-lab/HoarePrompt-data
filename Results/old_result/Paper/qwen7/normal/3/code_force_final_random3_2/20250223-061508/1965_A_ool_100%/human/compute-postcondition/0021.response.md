Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `set_`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(set_) - 1` (inclusive). This means `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `len(set_) - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is `2`
   - `not_c` is `False`
   - `A` is `False`
   - `set_` is unchanged from the previous iteration

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently `2`, the next value of `i` will be `3`.
   - The values of `not_c` and `A` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
   - `set_` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Condition Check**: The condition to break out of the loop is if the element at index `i` in `set_` minus the element at index `i-1` in `set_` is greater than `1`. However, since we are only adjusting the state for the next iteration, we don't need to evaluate this condition.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `not_c` is False, `A` is False, and `set_` is unchanged**. 

So, the final state is:

State: **`i` is 3, `not_c` is False, `A` is False, and `set_` is unchanged**.
