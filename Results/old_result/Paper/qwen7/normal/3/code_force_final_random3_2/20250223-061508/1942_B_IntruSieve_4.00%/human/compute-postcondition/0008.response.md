Output State: **`minn` is 0; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer; `mex` is a list containing 0; `maxx` is 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `minn` (which is 0) to the list `mex`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
