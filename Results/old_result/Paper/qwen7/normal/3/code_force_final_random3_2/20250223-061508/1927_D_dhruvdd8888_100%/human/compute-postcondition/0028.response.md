Output State: **`i` is 2, `N` must be at least 2, `s` is 2, `arr` contains the tuples `(2, 1, num)`, `(2, 1, num)`, and `(2, 1, num)`, and `num` is equal to `nums[2]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `num`. Given that `i` is 2, `num` is set to `nums[2]`. The values of `i`, `N`, `s`, and the content of `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
