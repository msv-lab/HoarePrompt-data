### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the array and the array elements.
   - It then calls `func_1(n, arr)` to compute the maximum beauty.
   - In `func_1`, the array is sorted and then rearranged by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements.
   - Finally, it calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - Sorting the array helps in easily pairing the smallest and largest elements.
   - Alternating between the smallest and largest elements ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
   - Summing the absolute differences between these pairs gives the maximum possible beauty.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all elements in the array are the same, sorting and rearranging will not change the beauty, which should be zero.
   - If the array has only two distinct values, the maximum beauty is the difference between these values multiplied by the number of elements minus one.

5. **Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement match the expected behavior of the solution.
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the rearrangement and calculation of the beauty.

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the function `func_1` does not always produce the correct maximum beauty. Specifically, the function alternates between the smallest and largest remaining elements, but this approach does not guarantee the maximum beauty for all possible input arrays.

Consider the following counterexample:
- Input: `[1, 100, 2, 101]`
- Expected Output: `200`
- Actual Output with the given function: `199`

Explanation:
- Sorting the array gives `[1, 2, 100, 101]`.
- Rearranging by alternating between the smallest and largest elements results in `[1, 101, 2, 100]`.
- Calculating the beauty: `(101 - 1) + (2 - 101) + (100 - 2) = 100 + (-99) + 98 = 199`.

The correct approach to maximize the beauty would involve pairing the smallest and largest elements directly without sorting, ensuring that the maximum difference is used at each step.

### Correct Solution:
A better approach would be to pair the smallest and largest elements directly without sorting, ensuring that the maximum difference is used at each step. This can be achieved by iterating through the array and pairing the smallest and largest elements.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    max_beauty = 0
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left < right:
        max_beauty += abs(arr[left] - arr[right])
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    if left == right:
        max_beauty += arr[left]
    return max_beauty
```

This approach ensures that the maximum difference is used at each step, leading to the correct maximum beauty.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the above analysis, the original solution is not correct due to the flawed rearrangement logic. The correct approach involves directly pairing the smallest and largest elements without sorting.

**Final: False**
