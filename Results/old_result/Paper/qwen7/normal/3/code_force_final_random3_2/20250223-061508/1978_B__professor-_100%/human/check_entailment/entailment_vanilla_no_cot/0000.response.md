Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns under the given promotion rules. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Case where \( b \leq a \):**
   - If the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (\( b \)) is less than or equal to the usual price (\( a \)), then it is optimal for Bob to sell all buns at the usual price \( a \). This is because selling even one bun at a lower price would reduce the total profit.
   - The profit in this case is \( n \times a \).

2. **Case where \( b - a < n \):**
   - If the difference between the modified price and the usual price (\( b - a \)) is less than the number of buns (\( n \)), then Bob should sell the first \( b - a + 1 \) buns at the modified prices from \( b \) down to \( b - (b - a) \), and the remaining buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - The sum of the modified prices for the first \( b - a + 1 \) buns is the sum of an arithmetic series: \( \frac{(2b - (b - a)) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} = \frac{(b + a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} \).
   - The profit in this case is \( \frac{(b + a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - (b - a + 1)) \).

3. **Case where \( b - a \geq n \):**
   - If the difference between the modified price and the usual price (\( b - a \)) is greater than or equal to the number of buns (\( n \)), then Bob should sell the first \( n \) buns at the modified prices from \( b \) down to \( b - (n - 1) \).
   - The sum of the modified prices for the first \( n \) buns is the sum of an arithmetic series: \( \frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2} \).
   - The profit in this case is \( \frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2} \).

The provided code correctly handles these three cases and computes the maximum profit accordingly. Therefore, the program is correct.
