Output: **6**

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `count` is either 3 or 1.
- `k` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is greater than `j + 1`, but the specific values of `n` and `j` are not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- The characters at indices `k` and `k + j` in string `s` are not `?` and are not equal to each other, but these details are not required to solve the problem.

Given that `count` is either 3 or 1, `count * 2` will result in either 6 or 2. Since the problem does not specify whether `count` is 3 or 1, we consider the maximum possible value, which is 6 (when `count` is 3). Therefore, the output is **6**.
