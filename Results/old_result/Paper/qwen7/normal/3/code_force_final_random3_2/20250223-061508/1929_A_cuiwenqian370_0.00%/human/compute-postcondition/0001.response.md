Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n; `new_arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `new_arr`. The original list `arr` remains unchanged as no operations were performed on it. Therefore, the output state retains the initial state of `arr` and introduces `new_arr` as an empty list.
