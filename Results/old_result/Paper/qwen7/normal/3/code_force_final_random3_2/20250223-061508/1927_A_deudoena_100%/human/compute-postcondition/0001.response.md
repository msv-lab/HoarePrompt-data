Output State: **`ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10 and `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B'; `m` is an input integer.**

The code `m = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `m`. The other variables (`ma`, `mi`, `t`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
