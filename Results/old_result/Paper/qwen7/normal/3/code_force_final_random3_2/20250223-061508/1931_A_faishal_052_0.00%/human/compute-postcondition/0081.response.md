Output State: **`j` is 1; `arr` is a list containing 1**

Explanation: The variable `lex` is not defined in the initial state, and the code `lex = lex - 1` attempts to decrement `lex`. Since `lex` is not initialized, this line of code will raise a NameError. However, following the instructions to update the values of the variables that have been changed and include all the information of the precondition that is still valid, we note that `j` is decremented by 1 from its initial value of 2, making it 1. The list `arr` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it.
