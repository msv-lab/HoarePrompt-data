Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing one additional element 'Bob' at the end, `i` is `test_cases`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `answers.append('Bob')` adds the string `'Bob'` to the end of the list `answers`. The lists `clues` and the variable `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
