### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the problem statement carefully.

#### Problem Statement Analysis:
The problem requires us to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations. Each operation involves selecting a subarray and setting all elements within that subarray to the MEX (Minimum Excluded) value of the subarray. The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the set.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function seems to be intended to calculate a value based on some recursive partitioning of the array. However, it does not directly relate to the MEX operation or the goal of maximizing the sum of the array elements.
   - The function uses recursion and dynamic programming to compute some value, but it does not seem to be the correct approach for solving the problem.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function also appears to be part of the recursive partitioning logic and does not directly address the MEX operation or the goal of maximizing the sum.
   - It tries to find the maximum value by partitioning the array and combining results from subproblems, but it does not correctly implement the MEX operation.

3. **Function `make_stairs`:**
   - This function is supposed to process the array to form a "stair" pattern, but it does not seem to be relevant to the problem of maximizing the sum of the array elements using MEX operations.
   - The function does not correctly implement the logic to set segments of the array to their MEX values.

Given the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not perform the MEX operation or maximize the sum of the array elements through the allowed operations.

#### Examples Analysis:
- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `2\n0 1`
  - Expected Output: `4 1`
  - Running the provided code with this input will not produce the correct result because the functions do not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements by setting segments to their MEX values.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `3\n1 3 9`
  - Expected Output: `13 0`
  - Running the provided code with this input will not produce the correct result because the functions do not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements by setting segments to their MEX values.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `4\n1 100 2 1`
  - Expected Output: `105 2`
  - Running the provided code with this input will not produce the correct result because the functions do not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements by setting segments to their MEX values.

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `1\n0`
  - Expected Output: `1 1`
  - Running the provided code with this input will not produce the correct result because the functions do not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements by setting segments to their MEX values.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
