Output State: **`tmp` is an empty list, `y` is an integer, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `y` is the third integer input.**

Explanation: The code `ans = x + y - 2` updates the value of `ans` by performing the operation `x + y - 2`. The other variables (`tmp`, `ii`, `a`, `n`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
