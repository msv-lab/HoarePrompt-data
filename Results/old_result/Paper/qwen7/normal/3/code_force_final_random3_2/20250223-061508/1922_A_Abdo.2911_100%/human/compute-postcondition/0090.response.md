Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is True, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, the elements from index `i` onwards will retain their original values, and `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The line `possible = True` sets the variable `possible` to `True`. No other changes are made to the variables, so the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `t` remain unchanged. The precondition that `elements from index i onwards will retain their original values` is also preserved.
