Output State: **`b` is `p[b] - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `s` is `p[s] - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `s = p[s] - 1` updates the value of `s` to `p[s] - 1`. The initial state of `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `k` is 0. After executing the code, `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`, while `b`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
