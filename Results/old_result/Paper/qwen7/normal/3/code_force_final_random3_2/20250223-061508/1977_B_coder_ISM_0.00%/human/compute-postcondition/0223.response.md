Output State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is an integer and i is less than 30, and `s` is a list containing '0'.**

The code `s.append('0')` adds the string `'0'` to the list `s`. Since `x` and `i` are not affected by this operation, their states remain unchanged. The list `s` now contains the element `'0'`.
