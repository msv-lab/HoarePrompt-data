Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the minimum number of screens needed to place a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons on a grid where each screen is a 5x3 grid.
- The provided code consists of three functions:
  1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function returns the smaller of two values, which is not used in the main logic of the program.
  2. `func_2()`: This function handles the logic for calculating the minimum number of screens needed. It correctly accounts for different scenarios based on the presence and quantity of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
  3. `func_3()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_2()` for each test case, which is the correct approach to handle multiple test cases.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the overall logic in `func_2()` seems to correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required based on the given constraints. The function handles all edge cases appropriately and uses the correct formulae to determine the number of screens needed.

Correctness: **True**
