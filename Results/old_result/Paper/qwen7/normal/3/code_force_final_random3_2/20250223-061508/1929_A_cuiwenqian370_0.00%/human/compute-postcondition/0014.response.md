Output State: **`left` is 1, `right` is `right - 1`, and `new_arr` is a list containing either the element `arr[0]` (if `left` equals `right`) or the elements `arr[0]` and `arr[right]`.**

Explanation: The value of `right` is decremented by 1, so `right` is now `right - 1`. The values of `left` and `new_arr` remain unchanged from their initial state.
