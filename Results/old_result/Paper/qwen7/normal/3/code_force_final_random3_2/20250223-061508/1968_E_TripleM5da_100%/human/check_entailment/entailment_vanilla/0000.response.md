Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to place \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
2. **Analyzing the Provided Program**:
   - The program takes an integer `t` as input, indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.
   - The program prints the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` initially.
   - Then, it prints coordinates of the form `(i, i)` for \( i \) from 3 to \( n \).

3. **Checking the Output for Different Values of `n`**:
   - For \( n = 2 \): The output is:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     3 3
     ```
     This results in the Manhattan distances \(\{0, 1\}\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) has size 2, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 3 \): The output is:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     3 3
     4 4
     ```
     This results in the Manhattan distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) has size 4, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 4 \): The output is:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     3 3
     4 4
     5 5
     ```
     This results in the Manhattan distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) has size 7, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 5 \): The output is:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     3 3
     4 4
     5 5
     6 6
     ```
     This results in the Manhattan distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) has size 10, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 6 \): The output is:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     3 3
     4 4
     5 5
     6 6
     7 7
     ```
     This results in the Manhattan distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\}\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) has size 13, which is correct.

4. **Conclusion**: The program correctly generates the required coordinates to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for different values of \( n \).

Correctness: **True**
