Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data[idx:idx + n]`**.

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` by mapping each element in the slice of `data` starting from index `idx` and ending at `idx + n` (exclusive) to an integer. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and `idx` is increased by 1 remains unchanged. The new variable `a` is created and contains integers derived from the specified slice of `data`.
