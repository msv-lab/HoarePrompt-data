Output State: **`h1` is a string representing the hour in 12-hour format, `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'; `h` and `m` are updated to the input values split by ':'**.

Explanation: The code takes input in the format `h:m` (hour:minute) and splits it into two strings, `h` and `m`. It does not directly affect `h1` and `time`, but it updates `h` and `m` to the input values. Therefore, `h1` and `time` retain their original values from the initial state, while `h` and `m` are updated to the input values.
