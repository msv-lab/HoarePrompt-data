Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3`**.

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated by adding `a + (b + c) // 3` to its current value, which was 0. Therefore, `k` now holds the value of `a + (b + c) // 3`. The other variables (`i`, `a`, `b`, `c`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
