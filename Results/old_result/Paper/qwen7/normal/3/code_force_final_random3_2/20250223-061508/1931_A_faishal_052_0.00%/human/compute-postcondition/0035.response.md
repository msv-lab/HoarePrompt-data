Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is between 1 and 51, `arr` is [26, 1, 26]**.

Explanation: The initial state of `j` is 2, `lex` is between 1 and 51, and `arr` is either [26, 1] if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, or [26, 26] otherwise. The code snippet `arr.append(26)` appends the value 26 to the list `arr`. Since the initial value of `arr` is either [26, 1] or [26, 26], appending 26 to `arr` results in [26, 1, 26] or [26, 26, 26]. However, since the exact value of `lex` is not specified, both cases are valid, but the most general form is given as [26, 1, 26] to cover both scenarios. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
