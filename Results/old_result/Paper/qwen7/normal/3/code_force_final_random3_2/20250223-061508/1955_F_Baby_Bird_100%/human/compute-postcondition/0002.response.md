Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case is represented by a line of input containing four space-separated integers. These integers represent the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence. For each test case, the function calculates a specific value based on these counts and prints the result. The final state of the program includes a series of lines, each containing the calculated result for each test case.**
