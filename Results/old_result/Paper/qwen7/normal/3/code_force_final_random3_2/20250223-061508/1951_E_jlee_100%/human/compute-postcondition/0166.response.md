Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True, `count` is 2, `count2` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `count2 = 0` initializes `count2` to 0. Since there are no other assignments or conditions that affect the other variables (`j`, `n`, `done`, `count`), their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
