Output State: `i` must be greater than 0; `start_index` and `i` define a valid range; `j` is `start_index + i + 1`; all elements in the range `[start_index, start_index + i)` are assigned the value of `i`; `arr[start_index + i]` remains unchanged and is not equal to `i`; `res` still contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`.
