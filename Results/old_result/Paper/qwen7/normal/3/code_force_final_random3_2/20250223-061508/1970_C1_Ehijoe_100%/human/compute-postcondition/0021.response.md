Output State: **`nodes` must have at least one key, and the length of the list associated with the key is exactly 1; `ends` now contains the key that was appended.**

Explanation: The code appends the `key` to the list `ends`. Since the initial state of `nodes` is such that it must have at least one key, and the length of the list associated with the key is exactly 1, these conditions remain true after the code execution. The only new information is that `ends` now includes the `key` that was appended.
