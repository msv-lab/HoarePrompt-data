Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a binary string \( arr \). It finds the indices of the first and last '1' in the string \( arr \), extracts a substring between these indices, and counts the number of '0's in this substring. The function prints the count of '0's for each test case and does not return any value.**
