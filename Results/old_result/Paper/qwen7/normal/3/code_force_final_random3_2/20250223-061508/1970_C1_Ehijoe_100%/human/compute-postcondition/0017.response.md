Output State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `n` (the value provided as input), `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[v]` now contains all integers `u` that are connected to `v` through the edges added during the loop iterations.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all `n-1` iterations. The variable `n` will still hold the value it was initialized with, which must be at least 2 for the loop to run even once. The variables `u` and `v` will continue to be the most recently input integers used in the last iteration of the loop. The `nodes` dictionary will contain lists of all nodes connected to each node, reflecting all the edges added during the loop's execution.
