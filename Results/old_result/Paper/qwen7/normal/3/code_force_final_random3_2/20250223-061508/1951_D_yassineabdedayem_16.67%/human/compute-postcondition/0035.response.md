Output State: **`rep` is increased by 1, `n` is reduced by `Min * Max`, `k` is adjusted by subtracting `Max`, `number` is `Min`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `n` must be non-zero, `k` must be greater than zero, `rep` must be less than 60, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `k = k - Max` decreases the value of `k` by `Max`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for the other variables (non-zero `n`, `k` greater than zero, `rep` less than 60, and `n` being greater than or equal to `k`) are still valid.
