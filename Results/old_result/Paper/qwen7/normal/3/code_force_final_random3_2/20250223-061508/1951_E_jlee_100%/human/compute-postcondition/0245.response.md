Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `n-1`
- `n` is greater than 0
- The character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`
- `done` is `True`
- `s[j]` is not equal to `x`
- `count` is equal to `j`
- `count` is greater than 0
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`
- `count2` is less than `count`

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.

Given that `j` is `n-1`, the slice `string[:j]` will include all characters from the start of the string up to but not including the character at index `j`. Since `j` is `n-1`, this means it includes all characters up to the second last character of the string.

The slice `string[j:]` will include all characters from the character at index `j` to the end of the string. Since `j` is `n-1`, this means it includes the last character of the string.

Therefore, the print statement will output two parts of the string `s`: one part from the beginning up to the second last character, and the other part starting from the second last character to the end.

Output: **s[:n-1], s[n-1:]**
