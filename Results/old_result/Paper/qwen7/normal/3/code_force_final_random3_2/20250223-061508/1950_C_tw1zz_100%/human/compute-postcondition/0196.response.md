Output State: **`h1` is an empty string, `m1` is equal to `m`, `h` and `m` are updated to the input values split by ':', `time` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code initializes `time` as an empty string. It does not perform any operations that would change the values of `h1`, `m1`, `h`, `m`, or `time`. Therefore, the values of `h1`, `m1`, `h`, `m`, and `time` remain as they were in the initial state.
