Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb - 1` set to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` plus 1, `ps` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `curr` is `pres + paths[length_of_paths] * (k - length_of_paths)`, `ress` is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `pb - 1` from the list `a` to the list `pathb`. This means `pathb` now contains one additional element, which is `a[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
