Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `tab` in the line `for i in tab:`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `tab` has at least one element. This means that `i` will take the value of each element in `tab` one by one until there are no more elements left in `tab`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `tab` is a list that must have at least one element.
   - `i` will be the next element in the list.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `tab` must still have at least one element, and `i` will be the next element in the list.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `tab` must have at least one element for the loop to continue, it must still have at least one element.
   - `i` will be the next element in the list, meaning `i` will be the first element of the remaining list.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `tab` must have at least one element (since it had at least one element before and we are continuing the loop).
- `i` will be the next element in the list, which means it will be the first element of the remaining list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `tab` is a list that must have at least one element, and `i` will be the next element in the list**
