Output State: **`same` is 1, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 3, `i` is increased by 1, `num` is `ar[i]`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The line `same = 1` changes the value of `same` from either 3 or 1 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them. Therefore, the updated state includes `same` being explicitly set to 1.
