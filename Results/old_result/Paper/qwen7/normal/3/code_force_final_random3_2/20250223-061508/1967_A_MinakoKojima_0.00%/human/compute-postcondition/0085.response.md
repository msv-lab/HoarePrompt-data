Output State: **`ans` is multiplied by `a[1] - a[0] * (a[3] - a[2])`, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The code multiplies `ans` by the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression `a[i] - a[i - 1]` becomes `a[3] - a[2]`. The initial state had `ans` already multiplied by `a[1] - a[0]`, so now `ans` is further multiplied by `a[3] - a[2]`. The values of `i` and the condition on `n` remain unchanged.
