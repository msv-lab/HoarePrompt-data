Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `mini` is equal to `arr[n-1]`: This means `mini` takes the value of the last element in the list `arr`.
   - `item` is `arr[n-1]`: This means `item` also takes the value of the last element in the list `arr`, which is the same as `mini`.
   - `res` is an input string: This indicates that `res` holds a string value, but the specific content of this string is not provided in the initial state.

2. **Print Statement Execution**:
   - The print statement is `print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)`.
   - Since `maxi` is not defined in the initial state, it is not present in the print statement. Therefore, `maxi` is not part of what will be printed.
   - `mini` is the last element of `arr`, so it will be printed.
   - `item` is the same as `mini`, so it will also be printed.
   - `res` is an input string, but since it is not included in the print statement, it will not be printed.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The print statement will output the string `'!'` followed by the value of `mini` and then the value of `item`.

Output: **! [mini] [mini]** (where `[mini]` is the last element of the list `arr`)
