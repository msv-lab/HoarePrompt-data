Output State: **`mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are recalculated based on the new value of `mid`, and `l < h` must still hold true.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mid` to be the midpoint between `l` and `h`. The values of `l`, `h`, `f`, and the conditions for `l` and `h` remain unchanged. `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are recalculated using the new value of `mid`. The condition `l < h` must still be true.
