Output State: **`l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`, `F` must contain at least one element.**

Explanation: The code `l = bisect_right(D, left - f)` uses the `bisect_right` function to find the insertion point for `left - f` in the sorted list `D`. This insertion point is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`. The value of `f` is assumed to be the first element of the list `F` because the initial state mentions that `F` must contain at least one element. Therefore, `left - f` is used as the key to find the appropriate index in `D`. The value of `F` remains unchanged, and the new value of `l` is determined based on the comparison with `D`.
