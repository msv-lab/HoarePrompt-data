Output State: **`same` is 2, `num` is `ar[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is infinity, `ar` is a list of integers, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `num = ar[i]` simply reassigns the value of `num` to be the same as the current value of `ar[i]`. Since `ar[i]` is equal to `num` initially, `num` remains unchanged. The other variables (`same`, `i`, `t`, `n`, `minn`, and `ar`) are not affected by this assignment.
