Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function simply returns the smaller of the two input values.
   - It is not used in the main logic, so we can ignore this function for now.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input.
   - It calculates the number of screens needed based on the number of `1x1` and `2x2` icons.
   - Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic:
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
       - `bxsfory` is calculated as the ceiling of `y / 2`, representing the number of screens needed for `2x2` icons.
       - `x` is adjusted by subtracting `15 * bxsfory` (since each `2x2` icon takes up 4 cells, and there are 3 columns, so 15 cells per row) plus `4 * y`.
       - `bxsfory1` is calculated as the ceiling of the adjusted `x` divided by 15 plus 1.
       - The total number of screens is `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.
     - If only `y` is greater than 0:
       - The number of screens needed is the ceiling of `y / 2`.
     - If only `x` is greater than 0:
       - The number of screens needed is the ceiling of `x / 15`.
     - If both `x` and `y` are 0:
       - The number of screens needed is 0.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_2`.

### Testing the Logic

Let's test the logic with the provided examples:

#### Example 1: `1 1`
- `x = 1`, `y = 1`
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(1 / 2) = 1`
- `x = 1 - 15 * 1 + 4 * 1 = -10` (This should be adjusted to 1 - 4 = -3, but since we can't have negative icons, it should be 1)
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(1 / 15) + 1 = 1`
- Total screens = `1 + 1 = 2` (Correct, should be 1)

#### Example 2: `7 2`
- `x = 7`, `y = 2`
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(2 / 2) = 1`
- `x = 7 - 15 * 1 + 4 * 2 = 7 - 15 + 8 = 0`
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(0 / 15) + 1 = 1`
- Total screens = `1 + 1 = 2` (Correct, should be 1)

#### Example 3: `12 4`
- `x = 12`, `y = 4`
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(4 / 2) = 2`
- `x = 12 - 15 * 2 + 4 * 4 = 12 - 30 + 16 = -2` (Should be 12 - 20 + 16 = 8)
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(8 / 15) + 1 = 1`
- Total screens = `1 + 2 = 3` (Correct, should be 2)

#### Example 4: `0 3`
- `x = 0`, `y = 3`
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(3 / 2) = 2`
- Total screens = `2` (Correct)

#### Example 5: `1 0`
- `x = 1`, `y = 0`
- `bxsfory = 0`
- `x = 1`
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(1 / 15) + 1 = 1`
- Total screens = `1` (Correct)

#### Example 6: `8 1`
- `x = 8`, `y = 1`
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(1 / 2) = 1`
- `x = 8 - 15 * 1 + 4 * 1 = 8 - 15 + 4 = -3` (Should be 8 - 4 = 4)
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(4 / 15) + 1 = 1`
- Total screens = `1 + 1 = 2` (Correct, should be 1)

#### Example 7: `0 0`
- `x = 0`, `y = 0`
- Total screens = `0` (Correct)

#### Example 8: `2 0`
- `x = 2`, `y = 0`
- `bxsfory = 0`
- `x = 2`
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(2 / 15) + 1 = 1`
- Total screens = `1` (Correct)

#### Example 9: `15 0`
- `x = 15`, `y = 0`
- `bxsfory = 0`
- `x = 15`
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(15 / 15) + 1 = 2`
- Total screens = `2` (Correct)

#### Example 10: `8 2`
- `x = 8`, `y = 2`
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(2 / 2) = 1`
- `x = 8 - 15 * 1 + 4 * 2 = 8 - 15 + 8 = 1`
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(1 / 15) + 1 = 1`
- Total screens = `1 + 1 = 2` (Correct)

#### Example 11: `0 9`
- `x = 0`, `y = 9`
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(9 / 2) = 5`
- Total screens = `5` (Correct)

### Conclusion

After testing the logic with the provided examples, we can see that the function does not correctly calculate the number of screens needed for some cases. Specifically, the adjustments for `x` and `y` are incorrect, leading to wrong results.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
