Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 4.
- `n` is 3.
- `j` is 3.
- `nx` is a string that can be one of several possibilities depending on the values of `xx[4][0]`, `xx[4][1]`, and `xx[4][2]`.

The string `nx` is constructed based on certain conditions involving `i`, `j`, and the values of `xx[4][0]`, `xx[4][1]`, and `xx[4][2]`. Since the exact values of `xx[4][0]`, `xx[4][1]`, and `xx[4][2]` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact string `nx`. However, we know that `nx` will be one of the specified patterns.

Given the constraints and the fact that `i` is 4 and `j` reaches 3, the exact pattern of `nx` depends on the values of `xx[4][0]`, `xx[4][1]`, and `xx[4][2]`. Without these specific values, we can only describe `nx` in terms of its possible construction.

Output: **nx (where nx is a string that can be one of 'x' + `xx[4][2]`, 'S' + `xx[4][2]`, 'F' + `xx[4][2]`, 'xS' + `xx[4][2]`, 'FS' + `xx[4][2]`, 'SF' + `xx[4][2]`, 'xF' + `xx[4][2]`, 'xS', 'xF', 'xSF', 'FSF', 'SFxF', or 'xFxF' based on the values of `xx[4][0]`, `xx[4][1]`, and `xx[4][2]`)**
