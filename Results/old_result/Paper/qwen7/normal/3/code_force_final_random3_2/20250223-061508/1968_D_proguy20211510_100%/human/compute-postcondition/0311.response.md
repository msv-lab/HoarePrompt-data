Postcondition: **`resb` is the maximum value obtained from the loop's iterations, `ress` is `paths[2] * k`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` plus the last computed `pathb[i]`, `pres` is `paths[1] * k`, `i` is 3, and `curr` is `paths[2] * k`. If `k < i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
