Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 3, `j` must be 1, `nx` is 'F', and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Initially, `nx` is an empty string (`''`). After executing the code, `nx` becomes `'F'`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
