Output State: **Each element in the list `a` is incremented by the sum of the first `n` natural numbers starting from 1; `cur` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `cur` to 0. The initial state of each element in the list `a` being incremented by the sum of the first `n` natural numbers starting from 1 remains unchanged. Therefore, the sum increment applied to each element of `a` stays the same, and `cur` is set to 0.
