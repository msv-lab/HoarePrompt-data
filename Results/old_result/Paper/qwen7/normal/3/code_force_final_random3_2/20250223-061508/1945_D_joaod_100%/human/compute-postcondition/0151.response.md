Output State: **`total` is either `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 1]`, depending on which is smaller; `na_frente` remains its initial value; `v` is `na_frente - 1`; `best` is unchanged; `best` is now equal to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

This means that the variable `best` has been updated to the value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
