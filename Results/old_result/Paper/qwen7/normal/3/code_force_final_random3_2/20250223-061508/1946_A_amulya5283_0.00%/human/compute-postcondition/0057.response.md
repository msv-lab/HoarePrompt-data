Output State: **`heap[0]` is now greater than `current_median`; `smallest` is the value that was at the root of the heap (`heap[0]` before popping).**

Explanation: The code removes the smallest element from the heap using `heappop`, which means the new root of the heap (now `heap[0]`) is larger than it used to be. The value that was removed is stored in the variable `smallest`. The initial condition that `heap[0]` was less than or equal to `current_median` no longer holds because the smallest element has been removed.
