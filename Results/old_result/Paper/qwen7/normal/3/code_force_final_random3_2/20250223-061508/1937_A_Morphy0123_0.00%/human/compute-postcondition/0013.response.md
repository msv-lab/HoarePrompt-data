Output State: `power` is 15, `n_cases` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than \(2^{14}\) and not equal to 1.

This output state is calculated based on the condition given in the loop: `while power < log2(n):`. The loop increments `power` by 1 each time it runs until `power` is no longer less than `log2(n)`. After executing the loop 14 times (since the output state after 3 iterations shows `power` as 4 and `log2(n)` must be greater than 3, implying `power` can go up to 14 before the loop exits), `power` reaches 15. At this point, `log2(n)` is greater than or equal to 15, meaning `n` must be greater than \(2^{14} = 16384\). All other variables (`n_cases`, `i`, and `n`) remain in their initial or previously described states.
