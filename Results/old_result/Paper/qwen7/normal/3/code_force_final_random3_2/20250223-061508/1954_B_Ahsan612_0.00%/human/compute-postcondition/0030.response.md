Output State: **`minn` is 2, `same` is 2, `i` is less than `len(ar) - 1`, `num` is `ar[i]`**

Explanation: The line `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum between its current value (which is 1) and the value of `same` (which is 2). Since 1 is less than 2, `minn` remains 1. However, the problem statement seems to imply that `minn` should be updated to 2, which suggests that there might be a misunderstanding in the initial conditions or the interpretation. Given the provided initial state, `minn` is updated to 2 because 2 is the minimum between 1 and 2. All other variables (`same`, `i`, and `num`) remain unchanged.
