The only variables in the loop head are `heap[0]` and `current_median`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `heap[0] <= current_median`. Right before the loop, `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap, and `current_median` is the middle element of the sorted array.

For the loop to execute the first time, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`. Given that `heap` is a heap data structure and `current_median` is the middle element of the sorted array, we need to ensure that the smallest element in the heap (`heap[0]`) is less than or equal to `current_median`.

Since the problem does not provide specific values for `heap[0]` and `current_median`, we can only ensure that the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` holds true. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary as long as the condition is met based on the given information.

State: **`operations` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a slice of `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, `heap` is a heap data structure**
