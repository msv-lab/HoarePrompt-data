Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to be attempting to solve the problem using a recursive approach to find the maximum sum and the operations needed to achieve it. However, the logic within these functions is flawed and does not correctly implement the solution.

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is intended to calculate the maximum sum of the subarray but uses a recursive divide-and-conquer approach that is not appropriate for this problem. The problem requires setting all elements in a subarray to the MEX value of that subarray, which cannot be solved efficiently using the current recursive approach.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to find the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum but also uses a flawed approach. It does not correctly identify the subarrays to set to their MEX values.

3. **Function `make_stairs`**: This function is not used correctly and seems to be an attempt to create a staircase pattern in the array, which is not relevant to solving the problem.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, a more appropriate approach would involve iterating through the array and setting each subarray to its MEX value directly. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def mex(arr):
    seen = set(arr)
    i = 0
    while i in seen:
        i += 1
    return i

def solve():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    operations = []
    for i in range(n):
        x = mex(arr[i:])
        for j in range(i, n):
            arr[j] = x
            operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))
    
    max_sum = sum(arr)
    print(max_sum, len(operations))
    for op in operations:
        print(op[0], op[1])

solve()
```

This solution iterates through the array and sets each subarray starting from the current index to the MEX value of that subarray. This ensures that the sum of the array is maximized.
