Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and \((-1)^i\) is equal to 1, `answer` is updated with the element at index `a[0]` from `array`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `a[0]` from `array` to the list `answer`. However, the values of `i`, `n`, and the condition \((-1)^i\) = 1 remain unchanged. The only new information is that `answer` now contains the element at index `a[0]` from `array`.
