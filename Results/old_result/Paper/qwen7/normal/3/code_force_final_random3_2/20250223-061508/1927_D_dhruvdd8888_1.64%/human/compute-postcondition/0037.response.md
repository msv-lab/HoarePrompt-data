Postcondition: **`N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `N + 1`, `s` is `N`, `num` is equal to `nums[N]`, `arr` contains tuples starting from (2, 0, `nums[0]`), followed by (1, 1, `nums[0]`), and ending with a tuple (1 + `s`, `N`, `nums[N]`), and `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting it to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The current value of `tc` is greater than 5. If `ppp == 23`, no changes are made to the variables.**
