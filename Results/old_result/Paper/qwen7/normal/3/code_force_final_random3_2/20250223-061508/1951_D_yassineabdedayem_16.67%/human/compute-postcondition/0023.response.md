Output State: **`n` must be non-zero, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` must be less than 60, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `min(n // k, k) - Max`, `k` is `k - Max`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by `Max`, which is `max(int(n / k), k)`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code.
