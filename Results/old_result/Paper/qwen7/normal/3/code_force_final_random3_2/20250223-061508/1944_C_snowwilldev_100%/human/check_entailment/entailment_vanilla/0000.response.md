Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
   - This part is correct and necessary to understand how many times each number appears in the array.

3. **Finding the MEX:**
   - The program iterates through numbers from `0` to `N` to find the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.
   - If a number `i` appears exactly once (`cnt[i] == 1`), it increments the counter `t`.
   - If `t` reaches `2` or if `cnt[i]` is `0`, it returns `i` as the MEX.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Logic for Finding MEX:**
   - The logic in `func_1()` is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns.
   - The program assumes that the MEX can be determined by counting the occurrences of each number and checking for the first missing number, which does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob.

2. **Game Simulation:**
   - The problem requires simulating the game where Alice and Bob take turns, and the final MEX is based on the sequence of moves.
   - The current implementation does not simulate these turns and directly computes the MEX without considering the optimal strategy of both players.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to simulate the game:
1. Alice always picks an element from `a` and appends it to `c`.
2. Bob always picks an element from `a` and removes it.
3. We need to determine the optimal moves for both players to maximize/minimize the MEX respectively.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program that simulates the game and finds the optimal MEX:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Alice picks first, so she will pick the smallest available number
    # Bob will pick the next smallest available number, and so on.
    # We need to simulate this process to find the optimal MEX.
    
    # Sort the array to make it easier to simulate the turns
    a.sort()
    
    mex = 0
    for i in range(N):
        if a[i] == mex:
            mex += 1
        elif a[i] > mex:
            break
    
    return mex

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())
```

### Conclusion

The original program does not correctly simulate the game and does not account for the optimal strategy of both players. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
