Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `n` is updated to the first input integer.
   - `a` is updated to the second input integer.
   - `b` is updated to the third input integer.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `t` must be greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be decremented by 1 (as it is used in `range(t)`). Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` is now `t - 1`, and all other variables remain unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**.
