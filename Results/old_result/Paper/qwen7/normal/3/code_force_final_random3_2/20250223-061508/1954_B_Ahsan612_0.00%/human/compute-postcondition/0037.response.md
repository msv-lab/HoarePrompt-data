Output State: **`minn` is the minimum value between its current value (1) and `same`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `same` is updated to be 1 if a different number is encountered or remains the same if the same number continues consecutively, `num` is the last element of the list `ar` that was processed, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, and `minn` is updated to be the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the variable `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value (which is 1) and the value of `same`. This means `minn` will be set to `same` if `same` is less than 1, otherwise, it remains unchanged. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, and `i`) remain unaffected by this line of code.
