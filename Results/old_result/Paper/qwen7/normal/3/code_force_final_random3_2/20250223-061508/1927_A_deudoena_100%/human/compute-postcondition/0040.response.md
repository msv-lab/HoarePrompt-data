Output State: **`d` is increased by 3, `j` is the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`, `c` is the length of `s`, `mi` is the index of the first 'B' in the original string `s`, `ma` is equal to `len(s) - d - 1`**.

Explanation: The value of `d` is increased by 1, so it is now increased by 3 (initially increased by 2 and then increased by 1). The values of `j`, `c`, `mi`, and `ma` remain unchanged from their initial states.
