Output State: **`ans` is the string where the last character is `chr(s[j] + 97)`, `j` is incremented by 1, `s[j]` is increased by 2, and `array` must still contain elements.**

Explanation: The code `s[j] += 1` increments the value of `s[j]` by 1. Since `s[j]` was previously incremented by 1 in the initial state, it is now increased by 2 in total. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
