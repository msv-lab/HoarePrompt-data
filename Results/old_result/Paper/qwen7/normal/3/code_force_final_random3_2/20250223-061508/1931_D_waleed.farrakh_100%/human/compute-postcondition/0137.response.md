Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter test_cases, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer representing the size of the array), x and y (two integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers), and arr (a list of n integers representing the elements of the array). The function returns the final value of count, which represents the sum of frequencies of all unique (a % x, a % y) pairs seen throughout the loop.**
