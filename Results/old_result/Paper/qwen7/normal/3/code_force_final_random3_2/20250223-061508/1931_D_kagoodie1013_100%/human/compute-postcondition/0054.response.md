Output State: **`count` is 0, `r_x` is -num % x, `r_y` is num % y, `current_key` is (num % x, num % y), `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**

Explanation: The line `r_y = num % y` updates the value of `r_y` to be the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
