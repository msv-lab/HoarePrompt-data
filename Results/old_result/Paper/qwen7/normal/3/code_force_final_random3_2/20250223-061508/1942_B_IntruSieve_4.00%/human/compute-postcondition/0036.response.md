Output State: **`minn` is either `maxx` + 2 or `maxx` + 3; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer; `mex` is a list containing either the absolute difference between each element in `arr` and `minn`, followed by `minn`, or one additional element which is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`, and now `mex` has an additional element which is `minn`; `maxx` is updated to the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` if `abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code `minn += 1` increments the value of `minn` by 1. Since `minn` was originally either `maxx + 1` or `maxx + 2`, after incrementing, it becomes either `maxx + 2` or `maxx + 3`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
