Postcondition: **`same` is either 4 or 2, `num` is either `ar[0]` when `same` is 4 or `ar[i]` when `same` is 2, `i` is either 5 or 6, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is 2, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 6. If `ar[i] == num`, then `same` is either 4 or 2, `num` is either `ar[0]` when `same` is 4 or `ar[i]` when `same` is 2, `i` remains either 5 or 6, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, and `minn` is 2. If `ar[i] != num`, then `same` becomes 1, `minn` becomes 1, `num` is now `ar[i]`, `i` becomes either 6 or 7, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 6.**
