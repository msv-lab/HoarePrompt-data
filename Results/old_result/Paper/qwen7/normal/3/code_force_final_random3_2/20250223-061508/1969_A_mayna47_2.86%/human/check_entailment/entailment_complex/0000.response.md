Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly identifies the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.
3. The function `func_1()` checks if there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This condition is used to identify pairs of friends who are best friends with each other.
4. If such a pair is found, it means only 2 invitations are needed (one to each friend in the pair), and thus it prints `2`.
5. If no such pair exists, it implies that every friend must be invited individually, leading to the need for 3 invitations, and thus it prints `3`.
6. The logic in the function is sound and aligns with the problem statement.
7. The function handles all edge cases as per the problem constraints (e.g., when `n` is 2, the function correctly prints `2`).

Given the above analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
