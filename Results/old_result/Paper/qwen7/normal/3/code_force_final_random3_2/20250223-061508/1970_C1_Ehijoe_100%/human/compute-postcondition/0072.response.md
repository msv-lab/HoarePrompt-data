Postcondition: `prev` is equal to `curr`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `tree` is a list containing all the nodes traversed from `s` to `e`, `curr` is equal to `e`, `moves` is a list containing `[idx, n - idx - 1]`, `idx` is the index of `start` in the `tree` list, and there exists at least one move in `moves` that is odd.
