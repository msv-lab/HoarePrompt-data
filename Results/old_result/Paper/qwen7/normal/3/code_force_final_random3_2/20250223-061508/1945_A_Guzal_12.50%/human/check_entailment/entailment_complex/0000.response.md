Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
3. The logic within the loop checks if it's possible to accommodate all participants based on the given constraints:
   - If `b % 3 != 0` and `c < 3` and `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, it means there are leftover extroverts and universals that cannot form a complete group of three, making it impossible to accommodate everyone. Hence, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents required:
     - `a` introverts need `a` tents since each introvert needs a separate tent.
     - The remaining participants (`b + c`) can be grouped into tents of three people. The number of full tents formed is `(b + c) // 3`.
     - If there are leftover participants (`(b + c) % 3 != 0`), an additional tent is needed to accommodate them.
4. The program correctly handles all the given examples and edge cases, including when `b % 3 == 0` and `c >= 3`, ensuring that all participants can be accommodated or determining that it's impossible to do so.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
