Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' with 'Bob' appended, `i` is `test_cases`**.

Explanation: The code snippet appends the string `'Bob'` to the list `answers`. The lists `clues` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `clues` remains a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` now contains its previous elements plus the string `'Bob'`, and `i` is still equal to `test_cases`.
