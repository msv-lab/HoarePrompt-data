Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions `a` and `b` for each case.
3. The logic inside the loop checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If at least one of them is even, it prints 'Yes', indicating that a new rectangle can be formed. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
4. The logic is sound because:
   - If either `a` or `b` is even, we can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with at least one side being even. These smaller rectangles can then be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, cutting the rectangle will result in two smaller odd-sided rectangles, which cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle (since the product of their dimensions would still be odd).

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the function correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form another rectangle.

Correctness: **True**
