Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that chips can be moved to the closest free cell to the left, which may not always be the immediate left cell.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
0 1 1 0
```
The program would output `1`, but the correct answer is `0` because the chips are already in a single block.

Another example is:
```
4
1 0 1 0
```
The program would output `1`, but the correct answer is `2` because we need to move the first and third chips to the leftmost free cell.

These examples show that the program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the minimum number of operations.
