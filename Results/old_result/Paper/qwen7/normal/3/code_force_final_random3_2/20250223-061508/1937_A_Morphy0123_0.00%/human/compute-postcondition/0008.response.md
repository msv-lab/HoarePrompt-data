Output State: **`power` is 2, `n_cases` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2 and not equal to 1**

Explanation: The value of `power` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables (`n_cases`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
