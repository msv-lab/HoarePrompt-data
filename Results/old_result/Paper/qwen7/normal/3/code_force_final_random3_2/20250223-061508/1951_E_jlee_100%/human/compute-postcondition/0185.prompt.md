Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing characters from `string`, `n` is the length of list `s`, `x` is the first character of list `s`, `done` is False, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and either `s[j]` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`, in which case `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken, or `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1. Additionally, `done` is True if `count` is greater than 1 or if `count2` is less than `count` and the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`. If `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, `done` remains `False`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is less than 1, `count2` is 1, and `done` is True if the character at index `j` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`, otherwise `done` remains `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True if `s[1]` is not equal to the character at index `n - 2` in string `s`, and `count` is 2, `count2` is either 1 or reset to 0 depending on the value of `count2` relative to `count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True, `count` is 2, and `count2` is either 0 or 1. If `count2` is less than `count`, `count2` remains unchanged. If `count2` equals `count`, or if `s[2]` is not equal to `s[n - 3]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
