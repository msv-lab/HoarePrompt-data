Output State: `l` is the smallest index in `D` such that `D[l] + f >= right`, `h` is the largest index in `D` such that `D[h] + f <= left`, and `mid` is the last calculated midpoint index within the range `[l, h]`.

This final state indicates that the loop has narrowed down the search range to the point where `l` points to the smallest element in the array `D` that, when added to `f`, is greater than or equal to `right`, and `h` points to the largest element in `D` that, when added to `f`, is less than or equal to `left`. The variable `mid` holds the last midpoint index that was used in the binary search process.
