Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `k` is `k - min(n // k, k)`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is an empty list, and `t` is 61.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to `k - Min`, where `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`. This means `k` is decreased by its minimum value between `n // k` and `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
