Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be at least 3; `x` is an input string; `j` is 3; `b[i]` is 2**

Explanation: The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is initially 1, `b[1]` is incremented by 1. Since `b` is not defined before this line, we assume it is a list or array where `b[1]` was initially 1 (as no other value is given). After the increment, `b[1]` becomes 2. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
