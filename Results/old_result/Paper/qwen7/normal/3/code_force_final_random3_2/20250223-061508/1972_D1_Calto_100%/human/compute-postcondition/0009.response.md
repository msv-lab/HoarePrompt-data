Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `m + 1`. This means `i` should be less than or equal to `m + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is 4 (not relevant to the loop)
   - `i` is 3
   - `x` is `n - 10` (not relevant to the loop)
   - `y` is 9 (not relevant to the loop)

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented to 4.
   - For the loop to continue, `m` must be at least 3 (since `i` is now 4 and it needs to be less than or equal to `m + 1`).

5. **Adjust the relevant states**:
   - `i` will be updated to 4.
   - `m` must be at least 3.

So, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`cnt` is 4, `i` is 4, `m` must be at least 3**
