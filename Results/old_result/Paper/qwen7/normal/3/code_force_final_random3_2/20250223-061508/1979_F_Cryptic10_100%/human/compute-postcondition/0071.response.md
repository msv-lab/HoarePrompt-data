Output State: **`vx` has one less element than before, `v2` is now the new last element of `vx`, `v3` is removed from `vx`, `ops` is updated to include two new elements `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`**.

This means that the list `vx` has lost its last element `v3` and gained a new last element `v2`. The list `ops` has been updated to include the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.
