The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables outside of a loop. Therefore, all the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string, `n` is 1, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of the input string, and the current value of `x` is not equal to the last element of `s`, and the count of `x` in `s` is equal to `n`.**
