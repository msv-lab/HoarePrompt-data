Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `i` is equal to `n-1`.
   - `cnt` is either 1 if `a[i]` equals `tmp`, or 0 if `a[i]` does not equal `tmp`.
   - `ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`.

3. **Understand what happens in the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is set to `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, in the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 (from `range(n)`), making `i` equal to `n`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must remain the same as it was in the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be incremented from `n-1` to `n`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `cnt` and `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `i` (which is now `n`), but since we are only asked to adjust the states at the start of the next iteration, we don't need to specify their exact values yet.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2**
