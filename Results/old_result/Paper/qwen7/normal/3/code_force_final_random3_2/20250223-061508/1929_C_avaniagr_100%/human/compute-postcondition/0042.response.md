Postcondition: `[*open(0)]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers assigned the values from splitting the string `s`. If `x < k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, then `a` remains greater than or equal to `x + 1`; otherwise, `a` is less than or equal to `x`. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, `a` remains unchanged; otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 2`. Additionally, the value of `z` will be the initial value of `z` plus the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each of the `x - k + 3` iterations.
