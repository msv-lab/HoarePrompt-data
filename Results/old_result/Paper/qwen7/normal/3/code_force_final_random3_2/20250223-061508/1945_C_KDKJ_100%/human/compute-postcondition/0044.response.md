Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues if either `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` is true. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1, and the values of `i`, `lsum`, and `rsum` remain unchanged.
3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ans` is -1
   - `i` is 1
   - `lsum` is 0
   - `rsum` is `n - 0` (which simplifies to `n`)
4. **Determine the Next Values**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The values of `lsum` and `rsum` will remain unchanged unless the conditions in the loop body are met, but since the postcondition states that `ans` is -1 and the loop continues if the conditions are true, it implies that the conditions were not met in the previous iteration, so `lsum` and `rsum` remain as they are.

Given these points, we can conclude that the only variable that changes is `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is -1, `i` is 2, `lsum` is 0, `rsum` is `n - 0` (or `n`)**
