Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `mex` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `mex`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial state.
