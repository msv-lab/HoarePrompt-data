Output State: `power` is 15, `n_cases` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2 (if it was 1) or `i + 1` (if it was the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15), and `n` must be greater than 16384.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `power` by 1 as long as `power` is less than the base-2 logarithm of `n`. Given that `power` reaches 15 after 3 iterations, we can deduce that `n` must be greater than \(2^{15} = 32768\). Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `power` will be 15, and `n` must be greater than \(2^{15} = 32768\). The other variables (`n_cases` and `i`) remain unchanged based on the provided conditions.
