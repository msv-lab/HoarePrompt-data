Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `cnt` is increased by 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`. If `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, then `i` is increased by 1. `j` is unchanged.**

This means that the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, but the conditions for updating `cnt` based on the comparison between `b[j]` and `a[i]` remain the same. The variable `j` is not affected by this line of code.
