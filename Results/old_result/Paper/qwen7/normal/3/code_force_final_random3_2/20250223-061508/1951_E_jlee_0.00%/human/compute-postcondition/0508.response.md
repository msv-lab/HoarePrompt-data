Output State: **`s` is a string, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` remains the same, `done` is True, `count` remains the same, `count2` is 0.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of `s`, `j`, `n`, `done`, `count`, or `count2`.
