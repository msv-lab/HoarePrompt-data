Output State: **`prime_to_i` is `prime_to_i * prime`, `rest` is a non-empty list, `factor` is now the first element in `rest`.**

Explanation: The code multiplies `prime_to_i` by `prime`. The value of `rest` remains unchanged, and `factor` is still the first element in `rest`. The value of `prime_to_i` is updated to its original value multiplied by `prime`.
