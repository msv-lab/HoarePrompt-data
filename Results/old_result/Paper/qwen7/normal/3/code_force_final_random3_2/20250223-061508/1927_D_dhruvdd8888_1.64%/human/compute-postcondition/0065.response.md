Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `N` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is set to `N + 1`.
   - `s` is set to `N`.
   - `num` is equal to `nums[N]`.
   - `arr` is a list of tuples starting from `(2, 0, nums[0])`, followed by `(1, 1, nums[0])`, and ending with `(1 + s, N, num)`.
     - This means `arr` looks like this: `[ (2, 0, nums[0]), (1, 1, nums[0]), ..., (1 + N, N, nums[N]) ]`.
   - `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one, so `LA = len(arr) - 1`.
   - `l` and `r` are obtained from splitting the input string and converting it to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(l, r)`.

Given the initial state, let's determine the values of `l` and `r`:

- `l` and `r` are obtained from the input string, but their exact values depend on the user input. Since the input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `l` and `r`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the values of `l` and `r` as obtained from the input.

Output: **l, r (where l and r are the integers obtained from the input string split and converted to integers)**
