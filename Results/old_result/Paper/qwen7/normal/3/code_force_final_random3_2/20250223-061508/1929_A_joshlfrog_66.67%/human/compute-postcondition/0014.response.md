Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `e` is 0, `l` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers split from the input, `x` is the minimum value between `nums[i]` and `y`, and `y` is the original value of `nums[i]`. If `nums[i] < y`, then `x` is updated to `nums[i]`.
