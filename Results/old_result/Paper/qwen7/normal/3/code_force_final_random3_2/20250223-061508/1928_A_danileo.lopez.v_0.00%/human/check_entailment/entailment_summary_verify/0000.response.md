### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Determine if a given rectangle \(a \times b\) can be split into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a new rectangle.
- **Key Points**:
  - A rectangle can be split into two smaller rectangles by cutting along one of its sides.
  - The resulting rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
  - Rectangles that differ only by a 90Â° rotation are considered the same.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program iterates over multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even.
- If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, it prints "Yes".
- Otherwise, it prints "No".

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even.
- If at least one of them is even, it prints 'Yes'.
- Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

#### Evaluation:
1. **Correctness of the Given Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the program's logic is incomplete. The program only checks if either dimension is even, which is insufficient to cover all cases where a new rectangle can be formed.
   - For example, a \(3 \times 3\) rectangle can be split into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a \(1 \times 3\) rectangle. The program incorrectly outputs "No" for this case.

2. **Revisiting the Program Logic**:
   - The program needs to check if the rectangle can be split in such a way that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a new rectangle.
   - A key insight is that if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the resulting pieces after splitting will always be able to form a new rectangle. This is because any split of an odd-sized dimension will result in one piece being odd and the other even, allowing for rearrangement.

3. **Correct Logic**:
   - The program should check if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. If they are, the program should print "No". Otherwise, it should print "Yes".

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program's logic is indeed incomplete and fails to handle certain cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect based on the given problem description and the provided function summary.
