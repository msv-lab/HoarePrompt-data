Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_arr` is a list containing the elements `arr[0]` and `arr[right]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `arr[left]` to `new_arr`. Given that `left` is 0, `new_arr` initially contains `arr[right]` and after executing the code, it will contain both `arr[0]` and `arr[right]`. The values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged.
