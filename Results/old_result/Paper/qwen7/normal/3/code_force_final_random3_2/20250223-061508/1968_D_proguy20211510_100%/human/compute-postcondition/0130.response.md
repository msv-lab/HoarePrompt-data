Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index pb - 1 set to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is now the value of p[pb - 1], `ps` is the sum of all elements in paths, `curr` is pres + paths[length_of_paths] * (k - length_of_paths), `ress` is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the curr values calculated during the loop iterations, `pathb` is a list containing the elements [a[pb - 1]], `paths` is an empty list, and the element at index pb - 1 of vis is equal to 1, and `pb` is updated to p[pb - 1].**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `pb` to `p[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The `vis` list and the element at index `pb - 1` being set to 1 are also unchanged.
