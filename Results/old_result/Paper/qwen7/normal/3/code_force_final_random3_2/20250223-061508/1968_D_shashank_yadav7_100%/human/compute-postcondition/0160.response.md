Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is 0.
- `n` is less than or equal to 0.
- `s` is calculated as `p[s] - n`.
- `sp` is increased by `a[s]` `n` times.
- `bp` is increased by `a[b]` `n` times.
- `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration.
- `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration.
- `bm` is not greater than `sm`.

Given that `n` is less than or equal to 0, increasing any value by `n` times (which could be 0 or a negative number) would not change the value significantly in a practical sense. Since `k` is 0, the expressions involving `k` will simply be the values of `bp` and `sp`.

Let's break down the relevant parts:

- `s = p[s] - n`: Since `n` is less than or equal to 0, `s` will be `p[s]` minus a non-positive number, which means `s` will still be a valid index in the list `p`.
- `sp = a[s] * n`: Since `n` is less than or equal to 0, `sp` will be 0 because multiplying any number by a non-positive number results in 0.
- `bp = a[b] * n`: Similarly, `bp` will also be 0.
- `bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`: Since `k` is 0 and `bp` is 0, `bm` remains unchanged.
- `sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`: Again, since `k` is 0 and `sp` is 0, `sm` remains unchanged.

Given that `bm < sm` initially, the conditions described do not change these relationships.

Therefore, the print statement `print('Sasha')` will output the string 'Sasha'.

Output: **Sasha**
