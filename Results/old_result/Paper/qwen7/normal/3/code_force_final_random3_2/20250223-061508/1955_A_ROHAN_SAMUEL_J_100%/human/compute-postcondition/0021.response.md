Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input and splits them based on whitespace, converting each to an integer and assigning them to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation.
