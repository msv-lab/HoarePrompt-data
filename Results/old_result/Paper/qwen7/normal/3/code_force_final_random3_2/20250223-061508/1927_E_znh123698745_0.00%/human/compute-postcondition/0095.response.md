Output State: The loop will execute \(n-1\) times in total. After all iterations, the value of \(i\) will be \(n-1\). The variable `answer` will contain \(n\) elements, starting with 1 and following the pattern described by the loop conditions. Specifically, if \((-1)^i\) is -1, the element at `array[a[-1]]` will be appended to `answer` and `a[-1]` will be decreased by 1. Otherwise, the element at `array[a[0]]` will be appended to `answer` and `a[0]` will be increased by 1. The final state of `a` will be such that `a[0]` is \(n\) and `a[-1]` is 1. The `array` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The `answer` list will contain elements from the `array` in a specific alternating pattern based on the loop conditions, starting with 1 and ending with either the first or last element of the original `array`, depending on the parity of \(n\).

In summary, the final `answer` list will contain \(n\) elements, starting with 1 and following the described pattern, with `a[0]` being \(n\) and `a[-1]` being 1.
