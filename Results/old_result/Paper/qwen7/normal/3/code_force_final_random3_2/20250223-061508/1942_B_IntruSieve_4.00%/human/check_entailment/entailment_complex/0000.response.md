Reasoning:

1. The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \), where \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
2. The provided program only defines a function `func_1()` but does not actually implement the logic to solve the problem. Instead, it reads the input and prints the `mex` list without generating the permutation \( p \).
3. The `mex` list is supposed to store the values derived from the MEX operation and the current value of `minn`, but it does not use these values to construct the permutation \( p \).
4. The program does not return or print the permutation \( p \) as required by the problem statement.

Given that the program does not correctly implement the logic to generate the permutation \( p \) based on the provided array \( a \), the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
