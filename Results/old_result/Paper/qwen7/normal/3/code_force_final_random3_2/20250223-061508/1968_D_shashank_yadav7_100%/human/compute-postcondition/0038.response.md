Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is assigned the value of `p[b] - 1`. Since `k` was already decreased by 1 before this line of code and the postcondition mentions that if `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `k` is now one less than its previous value. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was set to 2 initially and no operation altered it.
