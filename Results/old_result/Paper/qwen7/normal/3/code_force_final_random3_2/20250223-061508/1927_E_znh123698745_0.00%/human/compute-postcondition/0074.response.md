Output State: **`i` is within the range [1, n-1], `a[0]` is increased by 1, and `answer` contains the element `array[a[0]]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `a[0] += 1` increments the value of `a[0]` by 1. The initial state of `i` being within the range [1, n-1] and `answer` containing the element `array[a[0]]` appended to it remains unchanged except for the increment of `a[0]`.
