Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: t (a positive integer between 1 and 100), n (a positive integer between 1 and 100), a (a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order between 1 and 10^9), and b (a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order between 1 and 10^9). The function returns a value based on the comparison and relationship between lists a and b.**

This means the function takes in a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`, both of length `n` and sorted in non-decreasing order. The function then processes these inputs and returns a value based on the comparison and relationship between the elements of lists `a` and `b`.
