Output State: **`ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `k` is 0, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `r` is `r - 1`, `s[k]` is not equal to 'L'**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `r` which is now `r - 1`.
