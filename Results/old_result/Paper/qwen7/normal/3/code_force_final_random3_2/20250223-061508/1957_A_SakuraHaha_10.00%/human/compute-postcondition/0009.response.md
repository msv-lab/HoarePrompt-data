Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the first element of `a`, `cnt[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in the list `a` incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the count of the first element `x` in the list `a` using the `cnt` dictionary. If `x` is already a key in `cnt`, its value (count) is incremented by 1. If `x` is not a key in `cnt`, it is added to `cnt` with a value of 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
