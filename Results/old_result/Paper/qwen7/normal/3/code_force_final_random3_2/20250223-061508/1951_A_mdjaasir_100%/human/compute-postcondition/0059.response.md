Postcondition: `i` is 2, `t` must be at least 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string from the user, `count` is the number of times '1' appears in `a`. If `count` is 0, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
