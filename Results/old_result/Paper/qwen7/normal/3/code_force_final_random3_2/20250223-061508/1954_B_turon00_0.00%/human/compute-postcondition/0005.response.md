Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the elements of the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `aa = set(a)` creates a set from the list `a`. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. Since `a` is a list of integers, `aa` will contain each unique integer from `a` exactly once. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.
