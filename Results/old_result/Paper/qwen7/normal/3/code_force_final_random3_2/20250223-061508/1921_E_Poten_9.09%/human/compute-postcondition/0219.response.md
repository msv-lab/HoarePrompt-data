Postcondition: `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' with either an additional 'Draw' or 'Alice' appended. `i` is `test_cases`. If `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) > 1` is true, then `answers` has an additional 'Draw' appended. Otherwise, `answers` has an additional 'Alice' appended.
