Output: **NO**

Explanation:
- `k` is an integer.
- `x` is defined as `k - 1`, so `x` is also an integer and one less than `k`.
- `a` is a list of integers with a length less than `x + 3`. Since `x = k - 1`, the length of `a` is less than `(k - 1) + 3` which simplifies to `k + 2`.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`. There are no variables or objects whose values need to be substituted into this string because the string itself is a literal value.
