Postcondition: `i` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string from the user, `count` is the number of times '1' appears in `a`, and `count` is not equal to 0. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, then `count` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `count` is exactly 2, then either the next character after the first occurrence of '1' in `a` is not '1', or the character following the first '1' in `a` is '1'.
