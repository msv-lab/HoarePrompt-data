You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    t = int(input())

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` meets certain conditions and prints one of three possible outputs: "YES" followed by the number of operations needed to transform the string into a palindrome, or "NO" if no transformation can achieve the required condition. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   
2. **Single Character String:**
   - If the length of the string `n` is 1, the program prints "NO" because a single character cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. This is correct.

3. **Non-Palindromic First and Last Characters:**
   - If the first and last characters are different (`x != s[-1]`), the program prints "YES" and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring. This is correct because a string with different first and last characters is not a palindrome.

4. **All Characters are the Same:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same (`s.count(x) == n`), the program prints "NO" because the string itself is a palindrome. This is correct.

5. **All Characters Except One are the Same:**
   - If all characters except one are the same (`s.count(x) == n - 1`), the program checks if the middle character is different from `x`. If so, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring. This is correct.

6. **Checking for Non-Palindromic Substrings:**
   - The program iterates through the string to find the first non-matching pair of characters. If found, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring. This logic is flawed because it only checks the first non-matching pair and does not ensure that the rest of the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   
7. **General Case:**
   - The program attempts to handle more complex cases but fails to correctly partition the string into non-palindromic substrings. It incorrectly assumes that finding the first non-matching pair is sufficient for partitioning the string.

### Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case: "sinktheyacht"**
   - The program correctly identifies that "sinktheyacht" is not a palindrome and prints "YES" with the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.

2. **Test Case: "lllllllll"**
   - The program correctly identifies that all characters are the same and prints "NO".

3. **Test Case: "uwuowouwu"**
   - The program should identify that this string can be partitioned into "uw", "uow", and "ouwu". However, the program fails to correctly partition the string and prints "NO".

### Conclusion:

The program has logical flaws in handling general cases and does not correctly partition the string into non-palindromic substrings in all scenarios. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
