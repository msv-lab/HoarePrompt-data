Output State: **`i` is the length of `pathb` + 1, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` computed during the loop iterations, `curr` is the last computed value of `curr` within the loop, `resb` is the same as the previous value if it was updated or the original value otherwise, `n` is the first element of the input split, `k` is the second element of the input split, `pb` is the third element of the input split, `ps` is the fourth element of the input split.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into four parts and assigns them to `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. The other variables (`i`, `pres`, `ress`, `curr`, and `resb`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
