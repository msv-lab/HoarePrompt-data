Postcondition: `i` is 1, `t` must be at least 1, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is the new input string from the user, `count` is the number of times '1' appears in `a`. In both cases (whether the character following '1' in `a` is '1' or not), the values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `count` remain unchanged.
