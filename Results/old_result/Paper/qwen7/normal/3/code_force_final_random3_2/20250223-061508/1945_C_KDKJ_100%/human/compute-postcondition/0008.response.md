Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1', where n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 3 * 10^5.**

This means the function `func_2` does not take any parameters but generates and returns a string of binary digits ('0' and '1') with a specific length. The length of the string, denoted by `n`, must be between 3 and 300,000 (inclusive).
