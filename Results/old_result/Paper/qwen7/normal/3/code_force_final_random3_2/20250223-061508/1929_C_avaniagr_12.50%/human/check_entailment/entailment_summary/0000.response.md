Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the basic conditions given in the problem statement.
2. It checks the conditions for \(x < k - 1\), \(x = k - 1\), and \(x > k - 1\) separately.
3. For \(x < k - 1\), it checks if \(a \geq x + 1\).
4. For \(x = k - 1\), it checks if \(a \geq x + 3\).
5. For \(x > k - 1\), it calculates \(z\) using the formula \(z = 0\), and iteratively updates \(z\) based on the given logic, then checks if \(a \geq z\).

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the program appears to correctly determine whether Sasha can achieve the goal of having at least \(n\) coins for any integer \(n\).

Correctness: **True**
