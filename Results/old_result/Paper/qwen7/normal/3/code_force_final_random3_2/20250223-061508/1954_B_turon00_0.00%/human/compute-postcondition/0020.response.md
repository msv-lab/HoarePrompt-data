Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `i` and the constant `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is an index within the list.
   - `tmp` is an integer.
   - `cnt` is incremented if the element at index `i` in list `a` is equal to `tmp`.
   - If the element at index `i` in list `a` is not equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is set to 0 and `ans` is updated to be the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `i_prev`), and `n` was greater than or equal to `i_prev`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n`, `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the States:**
   - `i` is now `i_prev + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list such that `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is either incremented or reset based on the comparison with `tmp`, and `ans` is updated accordingly. `n` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 1`.**
