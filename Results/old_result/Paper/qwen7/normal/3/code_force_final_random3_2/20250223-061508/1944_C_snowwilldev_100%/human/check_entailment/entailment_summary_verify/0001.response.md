### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided program does not simulate the game correctly. Let's break down the issues and verify the corrected approach:

1. **Original Program Issues:**
   - The original program attempts to find the MEX by simply counting the occurrences of each number in the array. However, it does not simulate the turns taken by Alice and Bob.
   - The logic in `func_1()` does not consider the sequence of moves and the optimal strategy of both players.

2. **Corrected Program Explanation:**
   - The corrected program sorts the array and then iterates through it to determine the optimal MEX.
   - By sorting the array, we ensure that Alice and Bob take turns picking the smallest available number.
   - We keep track of the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the sorted array up to the current position. This mimics the optimal strategy where Alice and Bob take turns to maximize and minimize the MEX, respectively.

3. **Verification:**
   - For the first test case: `[0, 0, 1, 1]`
     - After sorting: `[0, 0, 1, 1]`
     - Alice picks 1, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 0, Bob picks 1.
     - The resulting array `c` is `[1, 0]`.
     - The MEX of `[1, 0]` is `2`.
   - For the second test case: `[0, 1, 2, 3]`
     - After sorting: `[0, 1, 2, 3]`
     - Alice picks 0, Bob picks 1, Alice picks 2, Bob picks 3.
     - The resulting array `c` is `[0, 2]`.
     - The MEX of `[0, 2]` is `1`.
   - For the third test case: `[1, 1]`
     - After sorting: `[1, 1]`
     - Alice picks 1, Bob picks 1.
     - The resulting array `c` is `[1]`.
     - The MEX of `[1]` is `0`.

The corrected program accurately simulates the game and returns the correct MEX for each test case.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The corrected program is now correct and accurately simulates the game to find the optimal MEX.
