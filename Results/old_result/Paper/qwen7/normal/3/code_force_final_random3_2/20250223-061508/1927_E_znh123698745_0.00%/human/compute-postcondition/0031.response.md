Based on the initial state provided:

- The loop will execute `n-1` times in total.
- After all iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1`.
- The variable `answer` will contain elements from the `array` based on specific conditions inside the loop.
- If `(-1)**i` is -1, the element at `array[a[-1]]` will be appended to `answer` and `a[-1]` will be decreased by 1.
- Otherwise, the element at `array[a[0]]` will be appended to `answer` and `a[0]` will be increased by 1.
- The final state of `a` will depend on how many times each condition was met during the loop iterations.
- The `answer` list will contain `n` elements, starting with 1 and following the pattern described by the loop conditions.

Given these conditions, the `answer` list will be constructed by alternating between appending elements from `array[a[-1]]` and `array[a[0]]` based on the evaluation of `(-1)**i`.

Since the exact sequence of `(-1)**i` evaluations cannot be determined, we know that the `answer` list will start with 1 and then follow the described pattern. However, the exact elements and their order in `answer` cannot be precisely specified without more information about the initial values of `a[0]` and `a[-1]`.

Therefore, the output will be the elements of the `answer` list, which starts with 1 and follows the described pattern.

Output: **1 [elements following the described pattern]**
