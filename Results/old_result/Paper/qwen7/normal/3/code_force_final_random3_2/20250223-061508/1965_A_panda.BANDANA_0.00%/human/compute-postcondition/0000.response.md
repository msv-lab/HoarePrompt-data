Output State: **t is an input integer, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; and the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n represents the initial number of stones in each of the n piles, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each pile. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
