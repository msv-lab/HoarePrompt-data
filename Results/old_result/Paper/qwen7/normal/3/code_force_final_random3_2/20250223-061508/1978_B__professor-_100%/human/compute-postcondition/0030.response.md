Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it takes three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9, and returns a result based on these inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases (specified by `t`), and for each test case, it receives three integers (`n`, `a`, and `b`). The function then performs some operation using these integers and returns a result for each test case.
