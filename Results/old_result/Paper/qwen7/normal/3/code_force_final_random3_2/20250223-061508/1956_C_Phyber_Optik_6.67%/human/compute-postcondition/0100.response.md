Output State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `r` is 0**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to an integer input from the user. However, the values of `j` and `r` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `j` is still `n + 1` (from the initial state), `n` is now an input integer, and `r` remains 0.
