Output State: **`testcases` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The function `func_6()` is called, but since no changes to variables are made within the function call itself, and no return values are specified, the only information that remains valid is the precondition that `testcases` must be greater than 1. No other variables are affected or updated by the given code snippet.
