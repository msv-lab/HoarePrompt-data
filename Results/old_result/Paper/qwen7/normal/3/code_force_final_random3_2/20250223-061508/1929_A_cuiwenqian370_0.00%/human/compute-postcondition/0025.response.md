Output State: **`left` is 2, `right` is at least 3, `new_arr` is a list containing `arr[0]` and `arr[right]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `arr[right]` to `new_arr`. Since `left` is 2 and `right` must be at least 3, `right` remains at least 3. The initial condition that `new_arr` contains `arr[0]` and at least one of `arr[1]` or `arr[right]` is maintained, now including `arr[right]` due to the append operation.
