Output State: **`empty` is True, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing one tuple (u, v), `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `nodes` is a defaultdict where all values are initially lists, `i` is 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer.**

The code reads two integers `u` and `v` from input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1.
