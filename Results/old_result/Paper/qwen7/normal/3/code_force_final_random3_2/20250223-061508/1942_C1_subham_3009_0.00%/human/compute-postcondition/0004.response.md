Output State: **`t` is an input integer - 1, `__name__` is `__main__`, `[n, x, y]` is a list containing three integers split from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input using `input().split()` and assigns them to the list `[n, x, y]`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was initialized as an input integer - 1, and the value of `__name__` remains `__main__` as it is a default attribute when a script is run directly.
