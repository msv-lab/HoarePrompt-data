Output State: `decoded` is an empty list, `mapping` is a dictionary containing all letters from 'a' to 'z' as keys, each mapped to the value `'a'`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each character from 'a' to 'z'. For each character `c`, it checks if `chr(c)` (which is the character itself) is not in the values of `mapping`. If this condition is true, it updates `mapping` with the key `chr(c)` and the value `'a'`, then breaks out of the loop. Since this condition will be true for all characters from 'a' to 'z' (as they are not initially in `mapping`), `mapping` will end up containing all letters from 'a' to 'z' as keys, each mapped to the value `'a'`. The `decoded` list remains empty as it is not affected by the loop.
