Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- The postcondition states that if \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 > i \times n \), then `r` is 1 and `sum` is \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \). Otherwise, `sum` is \( i \times n \).

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` is an input integer and does not change within the loop.
   - Therefore, `n` remains the same as it was at the start of the loop.

3. **Postcondition Check:**
   - The postcondition involves checking if \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 > i \times n \).
   - Since `i` is now 2, we need to check if \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 > 2 \times n \).
   - This condition will determine the values of `r` and `sum`.

### Adjusting the States:
- We need to update `i` to 2.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- The postcondition will be checked with `i = 2`.

### New State:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an input integer (unchanged)
- The postcondition will be checked with `i = 2`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer**
