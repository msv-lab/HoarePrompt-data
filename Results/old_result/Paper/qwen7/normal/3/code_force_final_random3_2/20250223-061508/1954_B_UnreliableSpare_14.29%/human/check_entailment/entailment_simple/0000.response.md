Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).
2. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the key issues:
   - The function `func_1()` does not actually check if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements. Instead, it checks if the array is already uniform and prints `-1` if it is.
   - The logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. It counts the length of segments of consecutive identical elements but does not consider the possibility of breaking these segments to make the array non-beautiful.
3. The program should iterate through the array to find the minimum number of removals needed to break the pattern of the beautiful array. This involves identifying the longest segment of consecutive identical elements and calculating the necessary removals based on these segments.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
