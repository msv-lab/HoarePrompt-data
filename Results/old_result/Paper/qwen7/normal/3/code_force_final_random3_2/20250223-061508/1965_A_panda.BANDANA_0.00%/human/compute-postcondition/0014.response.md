Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(t)`. This means the loop will run `t` times, with `i` starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is an input integer.
   - `i` is 0 (at the start of the first iteration).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `e` is a set containing unique elements from the list `l`.
   - `m` is the length of the list `l`.

4. **Determine the New State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is an input integer and does not change within the loop.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - The only variable that changes within the loop head is `i`, which will be incremented to 1.
   - The value of `t` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `e` is a set containing unique elements from the list `l`, `m` is the length of the list `l`**.
