Postcondition: `k` is either 0 or 1, `n` is the number of elements in the array, `ans` is updated as `ans // arr[l] % MOD` if `s[k]` is 'L', and `ans` is updated as `ans // arr[r] % MOD` if `s[k]` is not 'L'. Additionally, `res[c]` is always `ans % m % MOD`, and `r` is decremented by 1 if `s[k]` is not 'L'.
