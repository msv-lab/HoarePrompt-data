Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the condition `range(n - 1)`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `u` is an input integer
   - `v` is an input integer
   - `nodes[v]` now contains `u`

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The loop condition is `range(n - 1)`, meaning `i` should be less than `n - 1`. Since `i` is currently 1, `n - 1` must be greater than 1, which means `n` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[v]` now contains `u`**
