Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of non-negative integers `a` of length `n` for each test case, where `n` is a positive integer and `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5. The function returns a result based on the given conditions for each test case.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return value are not described here as per the instruction to only describe the parameters and return value without detailing how the function operates.
