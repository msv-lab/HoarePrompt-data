Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `total` is 10, `s` is a list of integers entered by the user, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `t` is 1 if the user input was greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `r` is an empty string, `i` is the last integer from `s`, and `x` is the index of `i` in `b` (which is now invalid)
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    x = b.index(i)
    r += a[x]
    b[x] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total` is 10, `s` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `b` is a list of 26 ones (since one of its elements was incremented), `t` is 1 if the user input was greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `r` is the character 'a' at index `x` in list `b`, `i` is the last integer from `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`, and `b[x]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `total` is 10, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of 26 ones with one element incremented by 1 at index `x`, `t` is 1 if the user input was greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `r` is the character 'a' at index `x` in list `b` plus 'a', `i` is the next integer from `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in list `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total` is 10, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of 26 ones with two elements incremented by 1 at index `x`, `t` is 1 if the user input was greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `r` is the character 'a' at index `x` in list `b` plus 'a' + 1, `i` is the next integer from `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in list `b` (updated to the next index)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
