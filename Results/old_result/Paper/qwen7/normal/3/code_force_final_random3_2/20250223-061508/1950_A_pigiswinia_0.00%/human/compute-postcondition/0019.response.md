Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input. Since both the if and else parts do not change the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
