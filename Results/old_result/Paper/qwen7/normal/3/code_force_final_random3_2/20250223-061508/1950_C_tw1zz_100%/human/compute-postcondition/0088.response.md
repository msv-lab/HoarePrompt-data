Output State: **`h1` is '03', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string, and `h` is '15'**.

Explanation: The variable `h1` is assigned the value `'03'`. The values of `m1`, `time`, and `h` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `m1` is still equal to `m`, `time` is still an empty string, and `h` is still '15'.
