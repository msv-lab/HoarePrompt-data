Output State: `adv` must be greater than 0; `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1)`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will contain a sequence of numbers starting from `a[i - 1] - 1` down to `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1)`, assuming `adv` is greater than 0. If `adv` is not greater than 0, then `ans` will remain an empty list.
