Output: **a * n (where a is the second integer input and n is an odd integer)**

Explanation:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), but this value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `n` is an odd integer, but its specific value is not provided.
- `a` is the second integer input, so it has a specific value from the input.
- `b` is the third integer input, and its value is greater than twice the value of `a`, but this information is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement `print(a * n)` will output the product of `a` and `n`. Since `a` is the second integer input and `n` is an odd integer, the output will be the product of these two values.
