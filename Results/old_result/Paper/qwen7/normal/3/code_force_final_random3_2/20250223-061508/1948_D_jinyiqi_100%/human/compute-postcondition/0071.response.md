Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from `n // 2` to `1` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**: The loop has completed all its iterations, meaning it ran from `n // 2` down to `1`, and for each value of `j`, it did not find a sequence where `count` reached the value of `j`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop has completed all its iterations, `j` will now be 0. This is because the loop starts at `n // 2` and decrements until it reaches 1, and then the next value would be 0.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration (which is actually the final state since the loop has completed) is:

**State: **`j` is 0, `n` is the original value of `n`**.
