Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires maximizing the sum of an array by performing operations that update segments of the array to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that segment. The solution should be able to handle arrays of length up to 18 efficiently and ensure the sum is maximized while using no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum sum that can be achieved for a given subarray. It splits the array into smaller subarrays and recursively computes the maximum sum for those subarrays.
   - **func_2**: This function finds the optimal operations needed to achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`. It checks if the entire subarray can be filled with a single value (MEX) and returns the operations required. If not, it recursively breaks down the subarray and finds the optimal operations.
   - **make_stairs**: This function is used to fill a subarray with a stair-like pattern (where each element is the index value). It ensures that the subarray is filled optimally to maximize the sum.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **func_1** correctly calculates the maximum sum using dynamic programming. It handles all edge cases, including when the subarray length is 1.
   - **func_2** correctly identifies the optimal operations to achieve the maximum sum. It handles both the case where the entire subarray can be filled with a single value and the case where it needs to break down the subarray further.
   - **make_stairs** correctly fills the subarray to form a stair-like pattern, ensuring the sum is maximized.

Given the detailed analysis, the functions collectively meet the requirements of the problem. They correctly calculate the maximum sum and provide the necessary operations to achieve that sum.

Correctness: **True**
