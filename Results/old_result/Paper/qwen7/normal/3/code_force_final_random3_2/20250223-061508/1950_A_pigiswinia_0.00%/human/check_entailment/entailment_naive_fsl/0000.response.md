Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a typo in the output string for the "STAIR" case. It prints 'STAIRS' instead of 'STAIR'. This will cause the output to be incorrect for all test cases where the digits form a stair. For example, for the input `1 2 3`, the program should output `STAIR` but it outputs `STAIRS`.
