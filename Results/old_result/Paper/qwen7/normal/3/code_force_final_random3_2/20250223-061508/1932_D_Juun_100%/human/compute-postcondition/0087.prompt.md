Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `trumps` is an empty list.

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `trumps` will be an empty list because the loop continues to run as long as `trumps` is not empty. Since the loop removes two elements from `trumps` in each iteration (with `trumps.pop()` called twice), eventually `trumps` will become empty, causing the loop to terminate. At this point, there are no more elements left to pop from `trumps`, so it remains empty.
Code of the loop:
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: - `answers` must be a non-empty list.

So, the final answer is:
State:

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `answers` must be a non-empty list

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `answers` must be a non-empty list with at least one element remaining, and the first element of `answers` will be the next `answer` in the loop




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
