State before the loop starts:

The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1, and `j` will start from `n-1` and decrement by 1 until it reaches -1.

Before the loop starts, the initial state is given as follows:
- `total` is 0 (though this does not affect the loop's execution)
- `students_list` is a list of students (though this does not affect the loop's execution)

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` must start from `n-1`.

State: **`total` is 0, `students_list` is a list of students, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n-1`**
