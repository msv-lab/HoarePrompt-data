Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 500.
- `r` must be non-negative (though `r` is not used in the print statement).
- `j` is greater than `n` (though `j` is not used in the print statement).

The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. Since `n` is within the range 1 to 500, the exact numbers depend on the specific value of `n`.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n** (where `n` is a number between 1 and 500)
