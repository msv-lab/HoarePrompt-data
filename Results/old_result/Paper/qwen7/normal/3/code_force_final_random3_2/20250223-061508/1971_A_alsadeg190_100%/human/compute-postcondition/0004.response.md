Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100.
- `i` is 0.
- `x` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
- The current value of `x` is less than the current value of `y`.

The `print(x, y)` statement will print the values of `x` and `y`.

Since `x` and `y` are obtained from the input split and converted to integers, and it is explicitly stated that the current value of `x` is less than the current value of `y`, we can directly use these values in the output.

Output: **x, y (where x and y are integers with x < y)**
