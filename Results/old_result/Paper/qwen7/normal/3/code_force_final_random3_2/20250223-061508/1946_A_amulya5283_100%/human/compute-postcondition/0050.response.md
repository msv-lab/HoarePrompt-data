Output State: **The loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches `n`. During each iteration, if `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]`, `res` will increment by 1. After all iterations, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is the total count of elements from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and `i` is `n`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` will be decremented by 1, `n` remains the same as the initial input, `a` is still a sorted list of integers, `res` contains the count of elements in the list from index `mdx` to the end that are equal to the middle element `a[mdx]`, `mdx` remains as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and `i` will be equal to `n`.
