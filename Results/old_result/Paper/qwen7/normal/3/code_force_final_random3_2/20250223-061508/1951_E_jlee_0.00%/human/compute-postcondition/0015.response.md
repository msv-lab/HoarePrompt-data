Output: **string (where string is the input string)**

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `string` is an input string.
- The `print(string)` statement simply prints the value of the variable `string`.
- No other variables or objects are manipulated or printed within the given code snippet.
- Therefore, the output will be the input string itself.
