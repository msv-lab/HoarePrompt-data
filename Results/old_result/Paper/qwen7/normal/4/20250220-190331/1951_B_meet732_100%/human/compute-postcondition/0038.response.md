Output State: **The program returns k - 1, where k is the index stored in the first element of the list ind, which is 0 since the length of ind is exactly 1.**

Given the initial state, `ind` contains only the index 0 because the length of `ind` is exactly 1. Therefore, when we return `k - 1`, it means we return `0 - 1`, which is `-1`.
