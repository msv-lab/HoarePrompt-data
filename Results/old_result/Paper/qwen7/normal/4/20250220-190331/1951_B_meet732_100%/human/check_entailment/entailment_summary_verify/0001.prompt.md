You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of distinct integers representing Cowdeforces ratings of cows. It returns a specific value based on the conditions met during its execution. Specifically, it returns:
- \( n - 1 \) if the loop completes without finding any indices where the rating is greater than the specified cow's rating.
- \( k - 1 \) if the first index found where the rating is greater than the specified cow's rating is 0.
- The first index found minus 1 if there is exactly one index greater than the specified cow's rating and it is not 0.
- The maximum of \( k - \text{index} \) and \( \text{index} - 1 \) if there is exactly one index greater than the specified cow's rating and it is 0 or less than or equal to \( k \).
- The minimum of the second index minus 1 and \( k - 1 \) if there are exactly two indices where the rating is greater than the specified cow's rating and the first index is 0.
- The maximum of \( \text{index}_0 - 1 \) and \( \text{index}_1 - \text{index}_0 \) if there are exactly two indices where the rating is greater than the specified cow's rating and the first index is not 0.
- The maximum of \( \text{index}_0 - 1 \) and \( k - \text{index}_0 \) if there is exactly one index greater than the specified cow's rating and it is greater than \( k \).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the number of matches a specific cow (cow `k`) can win in a tournament with `n` cows, where the cow with the highest rating in each match wins. We can perform at most one swap of cow `k`'s position with another cow to achieve this.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It correctly identifies the initial position of cow `k` and its rating.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the maximum number of wins for cow `k`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function takes a list `a` representing the ratings of the cows.
   - It identifies the rating of cow `k` (`x`).
   - It then looks for the positions of the two cows with ratings higher than `x` (if they exist).
   - Depending on the positions of these cows and cow `k`, it calculates the maximum number of wins cow `k` can achieve either without any swap or with a single optimal swap.

4. **Edge Cases and Logic**:
   - If no cow has a higher rating than cow `k`, cow `k` can win all matches except the last one.
   - If there is exactly one cow with a higher rating than cow `k`, the function correctly calculates the maximum number of wins based on the relative positions.
   - If there are two cows with higher ratings, the function considers the optimal swap to maximize the number of wins.

5. **Testing the Function**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the function.
   - The logic for determining the maximum number of wins is sound and covers all edge cases mentioned in the problem.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.
