Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ind` is an empty list, `a` is a list of n distinct integers, `c` is 0, `k` is within the range 1 to n, `x` is the integer at index k in list a.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] > x:
        ind.append(i)
        c += 1
    if c == 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a[0]` is either greater than `x` or `ind` does not contain 0, and `c` is 2, assuming that the if condition `c == 2` evaluates to true, otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, `a[0]`, `ind`, and `c` remain as per the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and if `c` equals 2, then `i` remains 1. Otherwise, the condition `a[i] > x` does not apply, and `i` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list, `x` is a value being compared against the element at index `i` in list `a`, and if `c` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `c == 2` is true, `c` remains unchanged; otherwise, no change occurs in the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `x`, and `c`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
