Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of wins for cow `k`. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Indicies**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to find the indices where the ratings are greater than the rating of cow `k`. However, this logic is flawed because it stops after finding just two indices, which is unnecessary.
   - The goal is to find all positions where cow `k` could potentially win, not just the first two.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases where cow `k` might already be in a winning position without needing any swaps.
   - It also does not consider the possibility of swapping cow `k` with another cow to maximize its chances of winning.

3. **Incorrect Return Values**:
   - The function returns values based on incomplete logic, leading to incorrect results in various scenarios.

### Correct Solution:
Here’s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1(a, k):
    x = a[k]
    n = len(a)
    left_win = -1
    right_win = -1
    
    # Find the first position to the left where cow k can win
    for i in range(k):
        if a[i] > x:
            left_win = i
            break
    
    # Find the first position to the right where cow k can win
    for i in range(k + 1, n):
        if a[i] > x:
            right_win = i
            break
    
    # Calculate the maximum number of wins
    if left_win == -1 and right_win == -1:
        return 0  # No possible wins
    elif left_win == -1:
        return n - k  # Can only win from the right
    elif right_win == -1:
        return k  # Can only win from the left
    else:
        return min(k - left_win - 1, right_win - k - 1) + 1

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k -= 1
    print(func_1(l, k))
```

This solution correctly identifies the potential winning positions for cow `k` and calculates the maximum number of wins based on these positions.
