Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is the loop variable, which starts from 0 in the first iteration.
   - `n` is the upper limit of the range, which is given as `n`.

3. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `i` should start at 0 for the first iteration.

4. **Consider the other given variables**:
   - `ind` is an empty list, which doesn't affect the loop execution directly.
   - `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, but its contents don't influence the loop's ability to run.
   - `c` is 0, which also doesn't impact the loop's execution.
   - `k` is within the range 1 to `n`, and `x` is the integer at index `k` in list `a`. These variables are not part of the loop head and thus do not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
