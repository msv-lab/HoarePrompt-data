Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 0; `ind` is a list containing the value 2; `c` is 1.**

The variable `c` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (since it was not defined before this line), making `c` equal to 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `ind`) remain unchanged.
