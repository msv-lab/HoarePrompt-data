Output State: **The program returns the first element of the list `ind` minus 1, where `ind` contains exactly one index greater than `k` and not 0, and this index is the only position in the list where the corresponding element of `a` is greater than `x`.**

This means that the program returns an integer which is the first (and only) index in the list `ind` minus 1. This index is guaranteed to be greater than `k` and not 0, and it's the only index in `ind` where `a[i] > x`.
