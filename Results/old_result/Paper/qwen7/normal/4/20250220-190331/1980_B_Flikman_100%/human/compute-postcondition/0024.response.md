Output: **YES**

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `favorite_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`.
- `i` is set to `k-1`, where `k` is greater than 0.
- `removed_count` is equal to the number of times the value at index `i` in `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value`.
- It is also explicitly stated that `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`.

Given this information, the `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string 'YES'. There are no variables or objects within the print statement itself that need further evaluation, so the output is directly 'YES'.
