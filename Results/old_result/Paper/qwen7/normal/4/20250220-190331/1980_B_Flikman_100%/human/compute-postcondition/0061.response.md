Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `k-1`
- `removed_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`
- `favorite_count` is the count of `favorite_value` in the list `sorted_a`
- `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`
- `removed_count` is greater than 0

The print statement is:

```python
print('MAYBE')
```

Given the conditions, the print statement directly outputs the string `'MAYBE'`. The values of `i`, `removed_count`, `favorite_count`, and other variables are not needed to determine the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **MAYBE**
