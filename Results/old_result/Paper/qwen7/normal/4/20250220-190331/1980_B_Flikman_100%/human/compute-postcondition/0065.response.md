Output State: **`i` is `k`, `removed_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`, `favorite_count` is the count of `favorite_value` in the list `sorted_a`, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, f, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `f`, and `k`. The values of `i`, `removed_count`, `favorite_count`, `favorite_value`, and `sorted_a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
