Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `removed_count` is either 2 or 3, `favorite_count` is the count of `favorite_value` in the list `sorted_a`. If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`, then `favorite_count` remains the same. Otherwise, `favorite_count` is less than the count of `favorite_value` in the list `sorted_a`.
