Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `favorite_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`, `i` is equal to `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `removed_count` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and mapping the input, `n`, `f`, and `k` are assigned the values of integers split from input, `favorite_value` is equal to `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers from `a` sorted in descending order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if sorted_a[i] == favorite_value:
        removed_count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is an integer less than `k`, `sorted_a[i]` is compared to `favorite_value`. If `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is increased by 1. If `sorted_a[i]` does not equal `favorite_value`, no change occurs to `removed_count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is an integer less than `k - 1`, and `removed_count` is increased by 1 if `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value`; otherwise, `removed_count` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the execution of the if else block, `i` is incremented by 1 and becomes less than `k`. `removed_count` is incremented by 1 if `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value`; otherwise, `removed_count` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
