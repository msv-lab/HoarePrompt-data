Output State: **`i` is `k`, `removed_count` is 2, `favorite_count` is the count of `favorite_value` in the list `sorted_a`, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers obtained by sorting `a` in descending order**

Explanation: The code `removed_count += 1` increments the value of `removed_count` by 1. Initially, `removed_count` was 1, so after executing this line, its value becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
