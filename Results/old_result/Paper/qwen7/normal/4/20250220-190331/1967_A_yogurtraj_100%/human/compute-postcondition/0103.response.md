Output State: **`i` is 1, `r` is `a[0] + 0 // 1`, `rem` is `0 % 1`, `y` is `n - 1 - 1`, `k` is 0**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `i`, `r`, `rem`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `r` is now `a[0] + 0 // 1`, which simplifies to `a[0]` since `0 // 1` is `0`. Similarly, `rem` is `0 % 1`, which is `0`. The value of `y` remains `n - 1 - 1`.
