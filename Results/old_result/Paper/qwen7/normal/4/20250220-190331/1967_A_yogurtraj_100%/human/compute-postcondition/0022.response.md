Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is decreased by 1, `k` is adjusted based on the condition, `rem` is k % 2, and `r` is updated accordingly.**

Explanation: The code calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `(i + 1)`, which is 2 since `i` is 1. So, `rem` is assigned the value of `k % 2`. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and `r` are adjusted according to the given conditions, and `rem` is now defined as `k % 2`.
