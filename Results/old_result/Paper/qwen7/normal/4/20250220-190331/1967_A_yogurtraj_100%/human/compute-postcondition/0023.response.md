Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is decreased by 1, `k` is adjusted based on the condition, `rem` is k % 2, `y` is n - 1 - i.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n - 1 - i` to `y`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `n` is decreased by 1 (meaning `n` was originally some value `x`, and now it is `x - 1`), the value of `y` is calculated as `(x - 1) - 1 - 1 = x - 3`. The values of `k`, `rem`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
