Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `rem` is 0, `r` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `y` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
        r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
        rem = k % (i + 1)
        y = n - 1 - i
        k = 0
        break
    else:
        k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
        r = a[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is decreased by 1, `k` is adjusted based on the condition, `r` is updated accordingly, and `rem` and `y` are defined as specified in the if part. Specifically, if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k` when `i` is 0, then `r` is set to `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1`, `k` is set to 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, if `i` is 1, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is either 2 or remains 1, `n` is decreased by 1 in both cases, `k` is adjusted based on the condition, and `r` is equal to `a[i + 1]` if the condition is not met. If the condition is met, `i` becomes 2, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `n` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
