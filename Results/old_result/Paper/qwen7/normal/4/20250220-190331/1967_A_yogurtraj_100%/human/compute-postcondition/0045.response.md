Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is equal to `n-1`. Given that `n` is 0, `i` would be `-1`.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `r` is the last element of the original list `a`. Since no specific value for `r` is given, we'll keep it as `r`.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
   ```

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is 1.
   - `r` is the last element of the original list `a`.

4. **Simplify the Expression:**
   \[
   (r - 1) * 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 2
   \]

Given this simplification, the expression evaluates to 2.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2**
