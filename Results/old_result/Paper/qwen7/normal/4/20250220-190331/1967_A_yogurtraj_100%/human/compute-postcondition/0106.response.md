Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `n` is greater than 0**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, which simplifies to `2 * (a[2] - a[1])`. The condition `n > 0` remains unchanged, and the condition `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) <= k` is still valid since it was true before the operation and `k` has only decreased.
