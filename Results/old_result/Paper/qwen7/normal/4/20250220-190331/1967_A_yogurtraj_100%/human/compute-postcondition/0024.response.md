Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is decreased by 1, `k` is 0, `rem` is 0, `y` is n - 2.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is explicitly set to 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. Since `n` was already decreased by 1 before this line of code, its new value is `n - 1`. The value of `rem` is calculated as `k % 2`, which is `0 % 2` resulting in `0`. Finally, `y` is recalculated as `n - 1 - i`, which simplifies to `n - 2` given the current values of `n` and `i`.
