Output State: **`ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 0, `r` is `a[0]`, `rem` is `0`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`**

Explanation: The line `k = 0` sets the value of `k` to 0. Since `r` was previously calculated as `a[0] + k // (i + 1)` and `k` is now 0, `r` remains `a[0]`. Similarly, `rem` was previously calculated as `k % (i + 1)`, and since `k` is now 0, `rem` becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
