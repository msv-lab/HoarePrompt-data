Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

In this output state, the variable `a` is updated to be a list of integers obtained by taking the input from the user (which was initially given as `n` and `k`), splitting it by spaces, and converting each element to an integer. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
