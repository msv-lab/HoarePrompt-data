Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `k` is 0, `r` is `a[n-1]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 1, `ii` is 1.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will increment in each iteration until it reaches `n-1`. Since the loop breaks when the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is true and `k` is set to 0 before breaking, the loop will continue to decrement `k` until it hits this condition or `i` reaches `n-1`. Once `i` is `n-1`, the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` will no longer be applicable because `i + 1` would be `n`, which is out of bounds for the list `a`. Therefore, `k` will be reduced to 0, and the loop will exit. At this point, `r` will be set to the last element of the list `a`, which is `a[n-1]`, and the other variables will retain their final states from the last iteration.
