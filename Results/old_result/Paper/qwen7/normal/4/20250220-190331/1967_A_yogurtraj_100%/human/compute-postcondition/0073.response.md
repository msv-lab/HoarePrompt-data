Postcondition: **`ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `k` remains 0, `r` is `a[0]` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `r` is `a[3]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0.**
