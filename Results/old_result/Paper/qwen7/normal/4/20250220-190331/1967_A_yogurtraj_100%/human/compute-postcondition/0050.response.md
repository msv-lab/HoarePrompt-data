Output State: **`ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user, `i` is -1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `r` is the last element of the original list `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 1.**

The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
