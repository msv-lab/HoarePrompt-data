Output State: **`ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), `r` is `a[3]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0**

Explanation: The code `r = a[i + 1]` assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to `r`. Given that `i` is 2, `i + 1` is 3, so `r` is now `a[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
