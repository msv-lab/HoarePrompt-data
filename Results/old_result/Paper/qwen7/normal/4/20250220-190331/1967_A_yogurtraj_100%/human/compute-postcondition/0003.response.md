Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation. The list `a` is updated to be its sorted version.
