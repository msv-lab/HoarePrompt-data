Output State: `i` is 50, `x` is greater than 100, `n` is within the range [2, 50], `flag` is True, and `l` is a list of integers entered by the user.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < x`. After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to 50 (since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time and starts from 0). The value of `x` remains greater than 100 because it is not modified inside the loop. The variable `n` is not used in the loop, so it remains within the range [2, 50]. The `flag` is set to True when the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` is met for any `i` during the loop's execution, and since it is not reset to False, it stays True. The list `l` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
