Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a list of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list p of n integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct). For each test case, it returns a specific value based on the given conditions.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t`, another integer `n`, and a list `p` of `n` integers. The function does not take any parameters itself but uses these inputs to determine the output for each test case.
