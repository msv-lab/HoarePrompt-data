Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 99
   - `x` must be greater than 99
   - `n` must be within the range [2, 50]
   - `flag` remains False
   - The list `l` remains unchanged

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 99, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 100.
   - The value of `x` must still be greater than 99.
   - The value of `n` must still be within the range [2, 50].
   - `flag` remains False.
   - The list `l` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 100, `x` must be greater than 99, `n` must be within the range [2, 50], `flag` remains False, and the list `l` remains unchanged**.
