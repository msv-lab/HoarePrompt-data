Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(0, x):`. The objects involved here are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - Initially, `i` is 50.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `n` must be within the range [2, 50].
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < x`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initially 50, for the loop to execute, `x` must be greater than 50.
   - The value of `n` does not directly affect the loop condition, but it must be within the range [2, 50] as per the given constraints.
   - The state of `l` (the list of integers) is not relevant to the loop execution itself, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `x` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 50, `x` must be greater than 50, `n` must be within the range [2, 50]**
