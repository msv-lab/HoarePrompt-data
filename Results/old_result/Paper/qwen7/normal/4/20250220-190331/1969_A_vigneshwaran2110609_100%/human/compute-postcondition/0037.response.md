Output State: **`i` is 51, `x` must be greater than 51, `n` must be within the range [2, 50], `flag` is True.**

The code sets the variable `flag` to `True`. Since the initial conditions for `i`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged, and no other variables are affected, these conditions are still valid. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `flag` and retains the original conditions for `i`, `x`, and `n`.
