Output State: **`i` is 50, `n` must be within the range [2, 50], `x` is an input integer.**

The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `x`. Since the initial state of `n` is within the range [2, 50], the condition for `n` remains unchanged. The variable `i` retains its initial value of 50. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `x` as an input integer, while `i` and the range of `n` remain as specified in the initial state.
