Output State: **`j` is 0; `dx` is `x[i] - x[0]`; `dy` is `y[i] - y[0]`; `visited[j]` is false; `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`; `coef1[j]` is `-coef1[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `coef1[j]` to be the negation of `coef1[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
