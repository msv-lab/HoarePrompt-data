Output State: **`nodes` is an empty list, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 0, and `ok` is True because `c1` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation: Initially, `nodes` is an empty list, `c0` is 0 (as it is the sum of `coef0[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`, which is an empty list), and `c1` is 0 (as it is the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`, which is an empty list). The condition `ok = ok or c1 != 0` evaluates to `True` because `c1` is 0, and 0 is considered `False` in a boolean context, making the entire condition `True`. Therefore, `ok` becomes `True`. The values of `nodes`, `c0`, and `c1` remain unchanged.
