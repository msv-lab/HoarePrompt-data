Output State: **`nodes` is a list containing the integer `i`; `visited[i]` is now True; `n` is an integer representing the number of disks, `x` is a list of integers representing the x-coordinates of the centers of the disks, `y` is a list of integers representing the y-coordinates of the centers of the disks, `r` is a list of integers representing the radii of the disks.**

Explanation: The code `nodes.append(i)` appends the integer `i` to the list `nodes`. Additionally, since `visited[i]` was already True, no change is made to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
