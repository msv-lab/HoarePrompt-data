Output State: **`c0` is increased by `coef0[j]`, `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `c1` by adding `coef1[j]` to its current value, where `j` is the next element in `nodes`. The value of `c0` remains unchanged from its initial state, which was increased by `coef0[j]`. Therefore, `c0` is still increased by `coef0[j]`, and `c1` is now increased by `coef1[j]`.
