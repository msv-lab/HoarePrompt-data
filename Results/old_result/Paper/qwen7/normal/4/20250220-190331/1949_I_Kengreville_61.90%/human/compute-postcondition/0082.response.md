Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be `n`, `nodes` will be an empty list, `c0` will be 0, `c1` will be 0, and `ok` will be `True` if any `visited[i]` is `False` and `c1` is not 0 for those `i`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will have incremented to `n`, meaning it has checked all indices from `0` to `n-1`. The `nodes` list will be empty because it gets reset at the start of each iteration. Both `c0` and `c1` will be 0 as they get reset to 0 at the start of each iteration. The variable `ok` will be `True` if during any iteration, `visited[i]` was `False` and `c1` (which sums up `coef1[j]` values) was not 0 for that particular `i`.
