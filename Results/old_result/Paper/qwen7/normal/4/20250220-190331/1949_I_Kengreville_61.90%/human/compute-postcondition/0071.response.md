Output State: **`nodes` must contain at least one element, `c0` is increased by `coef0[j]` where `j` is the next element in `nodes`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `c0` by adding `coef0[j]`, where `j` is the next element in the list `nodes`. The initial state of `nodes` containing at least one element and `c1` being increased by `coef1[j]` remains unchanged.
