Output State: **`nodes` is an empty list, `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]'**.

The initial state of `nodes` being an empty list remains unchanged. The variable `c1` is incremented by the value of `coef1[j]`. The previous state of `c0` being increased by `coef0[j]` is not relevant to the current code snippet, so it is not included in the output state.
