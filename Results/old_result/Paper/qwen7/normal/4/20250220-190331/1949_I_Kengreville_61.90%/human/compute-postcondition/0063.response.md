Output State: **`i` is a positive integer + 1, `nodes` is an empty list, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 0, `coef0[i]` is 0, `coef1[i]` is 1, `ok` is True if `visited[i]` is False.**

Explanation: The line `nodes = []` initializes the variable `nodes` as an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
