Output State: `nodes` is an empty list, `c0` is the sum of `coef0[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`, and `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`.

Explanation: Since the `nodes` list remains empty throughout the loop executions, neither `c0` nor `c1` will change from their initial values. The initial value of `c0` is 0, and the initial value of `c1` is 0. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, `c0` will still be 0, and `c1` will also remain 0. The `nodes` list stays empty as no elements are added to it within the loop.
