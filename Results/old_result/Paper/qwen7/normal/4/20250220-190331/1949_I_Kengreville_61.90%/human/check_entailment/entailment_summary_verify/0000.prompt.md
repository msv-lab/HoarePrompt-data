You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

#Function 1:

    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n

        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []
            dfs(i)
            c0 = 0
            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            ok = ok or c1 != 0
    if ok:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

#Function 2:
def dfs(i):
    if not visited[i]:
        visited[i] = True
        nodes.append(i)
        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                dfs(j)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function performs a depth-first search starting from the disk indexed by `i`. It marks the disk as visited and recursively visits all connected unvisited disks based on their positions and radii. For each connected disk `j`, it sets `visited[j]` to `True`, `coef0[j]` to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, and `coef1[j]` to `-coef1[i]`. After completing the search, all disks that are reachable from the initial disk `i` will have been marked as visited and their `coef0` and `coef1` values updated accordingly.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `dfs` function and the overall approach do not ensure that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency conditions.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Tangency Conditions**: The `dfs` function checks for tangency between disks using the equation \((r_i + r_j)^2 = (x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2\). However, this alone is not sufficient to ensure that the tangency condition is maintained when the radii are adjusted. The program needs to ensure that the tangency condition holds after adjusting the radii.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Adjusting Radii**: The program attempts to adjust the radii using coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`), but the logic for these adjustments is flawed. The program does not guarantee that the sum of the radii will strictly decrease while maintaining tangency.

3. **Missing Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where multiple disks are tangent to each other. For example, consider a scenario where three disks are mutually tangent. The program needs to ensure that the radii can be adjusted in such a way that the tangency conditions are maintained and the sum of the radii decreases.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:

```
4
2 2 2
7 2 3
7 7 2
2 7 3
```

This input represents four disks that form a square configuration, where each pair of adjacent disks is tangent to each other. According to the problem description, it should be impossible to decrease the sum of the radii while maintaining tangency. However, the current implementation might incorrectly suggest that it is possible to decrease the radii, leading to an incorrect output of "YES".

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and hence the correctness is **False**.
