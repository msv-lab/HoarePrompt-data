Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter i, which is an integer. It does not return anything explicitly but performs a depth-first search starting from the disk indexed by i, marking the disk as visited and recursively visiting all connected unvisited disks based on their positions and radii.**

This means the function `dfs(i)` takes an integer `i` as input, which represents the index of a disk to start the depth-first search from. The function then marks this disk as visited and recursively visits all other disks that are within its radius, provided they haven't been visited yet.
