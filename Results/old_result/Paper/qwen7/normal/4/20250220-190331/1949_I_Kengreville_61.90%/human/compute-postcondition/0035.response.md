Output State: **`c0` is the sum of `coef0[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., for each `j` in `nodes`), the variable `c0` will hold the total sum of all `coef0[j]` values, and `c1` will hold the total sum of all `coef1[j]` values from the elements in `nodes`. The values of `j` will cycle through each element in `nodes` exactly once during the loop's execution.
