#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains a single integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; the second line is a string s of length n consisting of '0's and '1's representing the initial state of the boxes; the third line is a string f of length n consisting of '0's and '1's representing the desired state of the boxes. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        t = input()
        
        s1 = s.count('1')
        
        t1 = t.count('1')
        
        cnt = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            cnt += s[i] != t[i]
        
        if s1 == t1:
            print(s1 if cnt else 0)
        else:
            d = abs(s1 - t1)
            print((cnt - d) // 2 + d)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning it has processed all test cases provided. For each test case, `cnt` reflects the total number of positions where the characters in `s` and `t` differ. If `s1` (the number of '1's in `s`) equals `t1` (the number of '1's in `t`), the output is `s1` if `cnt` is zero, otherwise, it is `0`. If `s1` does not equal `t1`, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, and the output is `(cnt - d) // 2 + d`. The variables `i`, `n`, `s`, `t`, `s1`, `t1`, and `d` are no longer changing within the loop context but retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \), a binary string \( s \) of length \( n \), and another binary string \( f \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state \( s \) into the desired state \( f \). If the number of '1's in \( s \) equals the number of '1's in \( f \), it outputs the number of differing positions if they are zero, otherwise, it outputs zero. If the number of '1's in \( s \) does not equal the number of '1's in \( f \), it computes the absolute difference and adjusts the count of differing positions accordingly before outputting the result.
