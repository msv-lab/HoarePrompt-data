Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `cnt` will be equal to the total number of positions where the characters in `s` and `t` differ, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, and `n` will be equal to the total number of iterations performed (which is the length of `s` or `t`, whichever is smaller).**

In simpler terms, `cnt` will hold the total count of differing characters between strings `s` and `t`, `i` will point to the last index of the strings that was checked, and `n` will represent the total number of iterations, which is the length of the shorter string between `s` and `t`.
