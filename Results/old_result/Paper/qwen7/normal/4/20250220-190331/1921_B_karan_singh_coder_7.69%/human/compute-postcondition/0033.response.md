Output State: **`cnt` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`, `i` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`**.

This means that the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1 if the characters at the current index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are different, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged. Additionally, the value of `i` has been increased by 1, and the condition that `n` must be greater than the new value of `i` still holds true.
