Output State: **`cnt` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`, otherwise it remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments the value of `cnt` by 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the character at the same index in string `t`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged. Since the exact values of `s`, `t`, and `i` are not provided, we can only say that `cnt` is updated based on the condition specified.
