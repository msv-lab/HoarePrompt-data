Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `t1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t1`, `t`, `n`, or `s`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of these variables while updating `cnt` to 0.
