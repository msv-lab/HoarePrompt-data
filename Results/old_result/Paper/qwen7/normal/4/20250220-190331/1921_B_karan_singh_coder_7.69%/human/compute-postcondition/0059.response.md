Postcondition: **`cnt` will be equal to the total number of positions where the characters in `s` and `t` differ, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, and `n` will be equal to the total number of iterations performed (which is the length of `s` or `t`, whichever is smaller). The characters in `s1` at the current position do not match the characters in `t1` at the current position.**
