Output State: `cnt` will be the total number of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` do not match, `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes, `n` will be decreased by the number of iterations (which is equal to the length of the string `s`), and `s` and `t` will remain unchanged from their final values after the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `cnt` will hold the count of differing characters between strings `s` and `t`, `i` will be set to `n-1` (where `n` was the original length of `s`), and `n` will be reduced to 0 since all iterations have been completed. The strings `s` and `t` will stay as they were after the last user input.
