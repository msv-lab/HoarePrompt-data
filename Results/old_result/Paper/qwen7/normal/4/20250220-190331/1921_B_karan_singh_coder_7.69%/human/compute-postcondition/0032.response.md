Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The relevant variables here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state after the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`, otherwise it remains unchanged.
   - `i` is increased by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is increased by 1, the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than this new value of `i`.

Given these points, we can summarize the adjustments needed:

- The variable `i` will be increased by 1.
- The variable `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`cnt` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `i` is increased by 1 from its previous value, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`**.
