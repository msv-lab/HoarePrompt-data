Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - Given that `n` is defined as `i + 2`, the condition becomes `i < i + 2`, which is always true for any integer value of `i`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`.
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `n` is `i + 2`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The new value of `n` remains `i + 2` because it is defined based on the current value of `i`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `cnt` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `i` is updated to `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains `i + 2`.

Given that `i` was less than `n` at the end of the previous iteration, and since `n` is `i + 2`, the new value of `i` (which is `i + 1`) will still satisfy the condition `i < n` unless `i` reaches `n - 1`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`cnt` is `cnt + (s[i] != t[i])`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is `i + 2`**
