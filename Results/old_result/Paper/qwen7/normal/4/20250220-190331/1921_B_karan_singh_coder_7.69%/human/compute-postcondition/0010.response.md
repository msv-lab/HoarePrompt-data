Output State: **`cnt` is 1 if the character at index 2 in `s` is not equal to the character at index 2 in `t`, otherwise `cnt` is 0; `t1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`; `t` is an input integer; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments `cnt` by 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `t`. Initially, `i` is 1, so `cnt` was updated based on the characters at index 1 of `s` and `t`. Now, `i` is incremented to 2, and `cnt` is updated again based on the characters at index 2 of `s` and `t`. All other variables remain unchanged.
