Output State: **`cnt` is equal to the total number of positions where the characters in `s` and `t` differ, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `n` is equal to the total number of iterations performed (which is the length of `s` or `t`, whichever is smaller), and `d` is equal to the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1` at the current position.**

Explanation: The code `d = abs(s1 - t1)` calculates the absolute difference between the characters `s1` and `t1` at the current position and assigns it to the variable `d`. The other variables (`cnt`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
