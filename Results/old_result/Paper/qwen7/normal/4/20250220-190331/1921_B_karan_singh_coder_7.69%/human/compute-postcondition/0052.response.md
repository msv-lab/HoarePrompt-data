Output State: **`cnt` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`, `i` is less than `n`, and `n` is `i + 2`; `cnt` is `cnt + (s[i] != t[i])`**.

This means that the value of `cnt` is updated by adding 1 if the condition `s[i] != t[i]` is true and `i` is less than `n` (which is `i + 2`). The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
