Postcondition: **`cnt` will be the total count of positions where the characters in string `s` do not match the corresponding characters in string `t`; `t1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`; `t` is an input integer; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `i` is `n-1`; `n` must be greater than 0; the current value of `s1` is equal to the current value of `t1`.**
