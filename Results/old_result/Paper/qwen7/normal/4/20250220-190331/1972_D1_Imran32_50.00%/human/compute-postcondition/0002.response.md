Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input, `ans` is equal to `n`, `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.**

This means that the variable `root` has been assigned the value of `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, while the other variables retain their initial states.
