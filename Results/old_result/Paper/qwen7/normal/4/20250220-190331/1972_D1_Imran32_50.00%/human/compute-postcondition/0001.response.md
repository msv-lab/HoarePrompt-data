Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input, `ans` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ans`. The values of `t` and `k` remain unchanged.
