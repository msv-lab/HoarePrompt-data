Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Function Definition**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but does not match the problem statement requirements. Specifically, it takes `n` and `k` as parameters, whereas the problem requires `n` and `m`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function `func_1()` is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that:
     - \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
     - \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - However, the implementation inside `func_1()` does not correctly address this condition. Instead, it calculates something related to the square root of `n` and does not involve `b` or the gcd condition at all.

3. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The logic inside `func_1()` seems to be counting multiples of some form of `i * i` up to `n`, which is unrelated to the problem's requirements.
   - This logic does not consider the constraints involving `b` and the gcd condition, making it incorrect for the given problem.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
