Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is equal to `2 * n`, `root` is at least 2, `cnt` is `root * root`, and `i` is `root`.**

Explanation: The initial value of `ans` is given as `n` plus \((n + i) // cnt\). After executing the line `ans += (n + i) // cnt`, `ans` is updated to its current value plus \((n + i) // cnt\). Since `i` is equal to `root` and `cnt` is `i * i` (which is `root * root`), the expression \((n + i) // cnt\) simplifies to \((n + root) // (root * root)\). Given that the initial value of `ans` was `n + (n + i) // cnt`, and now it is updated by adding the same expression, the final value of `ans` becomes `n + (n + root) // (root * root) + (n + root) // (root * root)`, which simplifies to `2 * n`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `root`, `cnt`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
