You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6, and the sum of all n and the sum of all m over all test cases do not exceed 2⋅10^6.

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is equal to `n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, root + 1))`, `root` is at least 2, and `i` is `root + 1`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains within the range of 1 to \(10^4\), `n` and `k` remain as they were initially, and `ans` is updated to include the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for each `i` starting from 2 up to `root + 1`. The value of `root` is at least 2, and the last value of `i` used in the loop is `root + 1`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, root + 1))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes two positive integers \(n\) and \(m\). It calculates and prints the value of \(n + \sum_{i=2}^{\text{root}} \left(\frac{n + i}{i^2}\right)\), where \(\text{root}\) is defined as \(\sqrt{n} + 1\). The function reads \(n\) and \(k\) from input, although \(k\) is not used in the calculation. After processing all test cases, it outputs the calculated value for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Given Program Analysis
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function Definition and Usage**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never called with the correct parameters. The function should be called with `n` and `m` as arguments.
   - The variable `k` is used in the function definition but is not defined in the main loop where the function is called.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic inside `func_1()` does not address the conditions specified in the problem. Specifically, it does not check whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The loop and calculations inside the function do not relate to the problem constraints.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
