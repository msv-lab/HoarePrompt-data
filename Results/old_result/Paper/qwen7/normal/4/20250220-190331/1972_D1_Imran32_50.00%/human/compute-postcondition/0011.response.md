Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is equal to `2 * n + (n + i) // cnt`, `root` is at least 2, `cnt` is `(root + 1) * (root + 1)`, `i` is `root + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `(n + i) // cnt` to its current value. Since `i` is `root + 1` and `cnt` is `(root + 1) * (root + 1)`, the updated value of `ans` is `2 * n + (n + (root + 1)) // ((root + 1) * (root + 1))`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
