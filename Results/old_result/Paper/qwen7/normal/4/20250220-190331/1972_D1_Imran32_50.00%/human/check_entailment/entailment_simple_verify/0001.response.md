### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the given program:

1. **Function Definition and Usage**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never called with the correct parameters. The function should be called with `n` and `m` as arguments.
   - The variable `k` is used in the function definition but is not defined in the main loop where the function is called.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic inside `func_1()` does not address the conditions specified in the problem. Specifically, it does not check whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The loop and calculations inside the function do not relate to the problem constraints.

However, the original assessment concludes that the given program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. This conclusion is accurate because the program does not actually check the required condition and instead performs an unrelated calculation.

The annotated code provides further insight into the state of the program, which confirms that the program does not correctly handle the problem constraints. The loop in `func_1()` iterates over values of `i` from 2 to `root + 1` and adds a value to `ans`, but this does not correspond to the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is correct. The program does not solve the problem as intended.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to solve the problem.
