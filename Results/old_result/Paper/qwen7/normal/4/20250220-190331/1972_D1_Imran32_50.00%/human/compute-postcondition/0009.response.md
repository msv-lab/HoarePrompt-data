Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(2, root + 1)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `root`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `k` is an integer.
   - `ans` is equal to `2 * n`.
   - `root` is at least 2.
   - `cnt` is `root * root`.
   - `i` is `root`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 2 to `root + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `root + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `root`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `root + 1`.
   - Since `i` is now `root + 1`, it is no longer within the range of the loop (2 to `root`).

5. **Update the required states**:
   - `i` should be updated to `root + 1`.
   - `root` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is equal to `2 * n`, `root` is at least 2, `cnt` is `root * root`, `i` is `root + 1`**.
