### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified several issues with the given program. Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to confirm the correctness:

1. **Function Definition and Usage**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but is not called with the correct parameters. The function should be called with `n` and `m` as arguments.
   - The variable `k` is used in the function definition but is not defined in the main loop where the function is called.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic inside `func_1()` does not address the conditions specified in the problem. Specifically, it does not check whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The loop and calculations inside the function do not relate to the problem constraints.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
   - The provided solution in the original assessment is a correct implementation of this approach.

Given the detailed analysis, the original assessment accurately pointed out the issues and provided a correct solution. The function `func_1()` in the given program does not correctly implement the required logic, and the suggested solution in the original assessment is indeed correct.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. The correct solution involves iterating through all pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
