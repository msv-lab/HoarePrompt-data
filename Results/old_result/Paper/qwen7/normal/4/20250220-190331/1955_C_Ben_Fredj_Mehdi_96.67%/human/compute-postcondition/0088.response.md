Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `z` is 0.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the first element of `a`.
- `k` is the second element of `a`.
- Either `n` is not equal to 20 or `k` is not equal to 10000000000.
- `k` is not equal to 5999999999.
- The current value of `k` is 4294967295.

The print statement is:
```python
print('8')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'8'`.

Output: **8**
