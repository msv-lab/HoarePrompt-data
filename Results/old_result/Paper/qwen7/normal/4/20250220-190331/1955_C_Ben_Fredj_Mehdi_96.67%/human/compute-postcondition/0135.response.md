Output State: **`a` is a list where the element at index `g` is reduced by 1, `i` is `m + 2`, and `k` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code `a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1` reduces the element at index `g` in list `a` by 1. The value of `i` is unchanged and is still `m + 2`. The value of `k` remains the same as it was in the initial state.
