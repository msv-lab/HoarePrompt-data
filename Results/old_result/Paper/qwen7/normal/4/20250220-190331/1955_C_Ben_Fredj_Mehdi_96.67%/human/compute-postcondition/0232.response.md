Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input, `d` is the length of list `a` minus 2, `k` is at least 2, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input, `g` is 3, `a[d]` is -1, `a[g]` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `k // 2`.**

This postcondition indicates that after the execution of the if-else block, `t` remains an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` becomes 2, `a` is a list of integers as initially defined, `d` is the length of list `a` minus 2, `k` is at least 2, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input, `g` is set to 3, `a[d]` is -1, `a[g]` is 1, and `i` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `k // 2`.
