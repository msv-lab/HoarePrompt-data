Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers where the last element (a[d]) is decreased by 1, `k` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 1, `g` is 1, and if `a[g]` is 0, the value of `a[g]` remains unchanged.** 

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `a[d] == 0` is true or false, the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `k`, `i`, `d`, and `g` remain as specified in the precondition. The only change is that the last element of the list `a` (a[d]) is always decreased by 1, and if `a[g]` is 0, its value remains unchanged.
