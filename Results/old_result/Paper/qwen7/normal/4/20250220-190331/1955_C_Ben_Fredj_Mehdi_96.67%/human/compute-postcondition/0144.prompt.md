Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first element of `a`, `k` is the second element of `a`, `d` is the length of `a` minus 1, `g` is 0, and neither `n` is equal to 20 nor `k` is equal to 10000000000. Additionally, `k` is not equal to 5999999999, `k` is not equal to 4294967295, either `n` is not equal to 2 or `k` is not equal to `a[0] - 1` or `k` is not equal to `a[1] - 2`, and `k` is not equal to 3000000000, and the sum of the elements in `a` is greater than `k`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: - `a` is a list.
- `d` and `g` are indices within the list `a`.
- The elements at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` are either reduced by 1 or remain unchanged depending on whether they were out of bounds or caused an exception.
- If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list where the element at index `d` is reduced by 1, `i` is `m + 1`, and `k` remains the same. If an exception occurs (such as an invalid conversion to integer or an attempt to decrement an already zero element), the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The list `a` is modified by decrementing the elements at indices `g` and `d` by 1. If the element at index `g` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If the element at index `d` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
