Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input, `k` is the integer value of the substring after the first space in the input, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input received from `input()` function. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in list `a`, then `k` is 0. Otherwise, `d` is the length of list `a` minus `k`, `k` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input, `g` is the maximum index where `a[g]` is greater than 0, and `a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 1` if `k % 2 == 1`. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged.
