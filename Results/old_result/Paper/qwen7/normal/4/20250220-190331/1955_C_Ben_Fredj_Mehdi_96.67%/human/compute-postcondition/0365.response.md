Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers. If `k` is equal to 1000000000, `t`, `z`, and `a` remain unchanged. If `k` is equal to 2147483648, 10000000000, 5999999999, or 4294967295, or 3000000000, `t`, `z`, and `a` remain unchanged. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `a`, `t`, `z`, and `a` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the last `k // 2` elements of `a` are each decreased by 1, `i` is set to `k // 2 - 1`, `d` is set to the length of `a` minus `k // 2`, and if `k` is odd, `a[k // 2]` is decreased by 1.
