Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input, `d` is the length of list `a` minus 1, `k` is the integer value of the substring after the first space in the input, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input received from `input()` function, `g` is 0.**

The code `g = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `g`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
