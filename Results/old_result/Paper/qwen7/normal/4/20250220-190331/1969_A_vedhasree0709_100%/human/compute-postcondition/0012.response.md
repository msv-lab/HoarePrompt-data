Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index 0 of list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of list `l`. The value of `q` is equal to `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately surrounding the `break` statement, it simply exits the current context without changing the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain as they were in the initial state, and we note that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
