Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` part. This means the loop will run based on the input value provided by the user.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n`
   - `j` is 1
   - `p` is `l[n-1]`
   - `q` is `l[p - 1]`

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop will execute again if the input value (let's call it `k`) is a positive integer.
   - After each iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, starting from `n`.
   - `j` will remain 1.
   - `p` will be updated to `l[i-1]` (since `i` starts from `n` and increments).
   - `q` will be updated to `l[p - 1]`.

Given that the loop is controlled by the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is a positive integer for the loop to continue. Since we don't know the exact value of the input, we can only say that the loop will continue if the input is a positive integer.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` will be `n + 1` (since it starts from `n` and increments by 1).
- `j` remains 1.
- `p` will be `l[n]` (since `i` becomes `n + 1` and `p` is updated to `l[i-1]`).
- `q` will be `l[p - 1]`, which is `l[l[n]]`.

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[n]`, `q` is `l[l[n]]`**
