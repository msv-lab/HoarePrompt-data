Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[2]`, `q` is `l[0]`**

Explanation: The code `p = l[i]` assigns the value at index `i` of list `l` to variable `p`. Given that `i` is 2, `p` is now assigned the value at index 2 of list `l`, which is represented as `l[2]`. The values of `j`, `p` (previously `l[1]`), and `q` (previously `l[0]`) are updated accordingly. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 remains unchanged.
