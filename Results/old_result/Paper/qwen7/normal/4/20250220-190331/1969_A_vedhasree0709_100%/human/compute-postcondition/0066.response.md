Output State: **`i` is 3; `p` is `l[3]`; `q` is `l[2]`; `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the variables retain their initial values from the initial state.
