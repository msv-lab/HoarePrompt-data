Output State: `i` is `n`, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[n-1]`, `q` is `l[l[n-1]-1]`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches `n`. Given that the loop has executed three times and `i` is incremented by 1 each time, we can infer that `n` is at least 3. Since the loop breaks when `j` is set to 1 (which happens when the condition `q == i + 1` is met), and no further changes occur to `j` after the break, `j` remains 1. The final values of `p` and `q` will be determined by the last iteration of the loop, where `p` is assigned the value of `l[i-1]` (or `l[n-1]`), and `q` is assigned the value of `l[p-1]` (or `l[l[n-1]-1]`).
