The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i <= n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`.

Given that `i` is currently 1, the only way for the loop to execute again is if `n` is greater than 2 (since `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`, and `i` is 1).

No other states need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head conditions.

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[0]`, `q` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2**
