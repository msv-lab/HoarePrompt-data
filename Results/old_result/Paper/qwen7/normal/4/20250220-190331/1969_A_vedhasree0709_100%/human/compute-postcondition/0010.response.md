Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.
- `j` is 0.
- `p` is the integer at index 0 of list `l`, so `p = l[0]`.
- `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of list `l`, and it is given that `q = i + 1`.

Given `i = 1`, we have:
- `q = i + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the integer 2.

Output: **2**
