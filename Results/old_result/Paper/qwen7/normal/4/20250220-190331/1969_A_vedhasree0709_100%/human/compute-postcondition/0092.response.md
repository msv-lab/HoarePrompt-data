Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[1]`, `q` is `l[0]`**

Explanation: The code `q = l[p - 1]` assigns the value of the element at index `p - 1` in the list `l` to the variable `q`. Given that `p` is initially `l[1]`, substituting `p` with `l[1]` in the expression `p - 1` gives us `l[1] - 1`, which simplifies to `l[0]`. Therefore, `q` is now assigned the value of `l[0]`. All other variables (`i`, `j`, and `p`) remain unchanged.
