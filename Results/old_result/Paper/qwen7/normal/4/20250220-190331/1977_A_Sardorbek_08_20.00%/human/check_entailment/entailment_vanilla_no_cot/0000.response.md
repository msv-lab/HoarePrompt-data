Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically:

1. The logic to check if `b % 2 == c % 2` is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
2. The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` should be `elif b % 2 == c % 2:`.
3. The program should check if the difference between `b` and `c` is even because each move changes the count of cubes by 1 (either +1 or -1), which means the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cubes must match the parity of the number of moves if it's possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('Yes')
        elif (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

This corrected function checks if the difference between `b` and `c` is even, which is the correct condition to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
