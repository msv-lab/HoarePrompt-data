Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `a` must be at least 1.
- `b` is an integer from the input.
- `c` is an integer from the input.
- `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.
- `b` is not equal to `c`.
- The current value of `b` is less than the current value of `c`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
