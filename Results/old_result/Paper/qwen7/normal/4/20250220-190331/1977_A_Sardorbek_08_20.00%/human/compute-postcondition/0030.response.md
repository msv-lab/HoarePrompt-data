Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` must be at least 1, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: Since both the if and else parts of the if-else block do not change the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, and `i`, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
