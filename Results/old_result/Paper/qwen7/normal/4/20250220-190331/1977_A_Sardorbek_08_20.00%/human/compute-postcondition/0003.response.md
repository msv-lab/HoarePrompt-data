Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` must be at least 1, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`**.

Explanation: The code `q = b, c` assigns a tuple containing the values of `b` and `c` to the variable `q`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
