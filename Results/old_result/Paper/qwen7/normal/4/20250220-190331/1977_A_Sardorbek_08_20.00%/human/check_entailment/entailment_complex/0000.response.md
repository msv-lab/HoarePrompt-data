Reasoning:

The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates over each test case. This part is correct.

2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: The program correctly reads two integers `b` and `c` for each test case using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Conditions for Printing Output**:
   - **Condition 1**: If `b == c`, it prints 'YES'. This condition is correct.
   - **Condition 2**: If `b < c`, it prints 'NO'. This condition is also correct.
   - **Condition 3**: The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` is incorrect. Here, `a` is the number of test cases, not related to the parity of `b` and `c`. The correct condition should check the parity of `b` and `c`.
   - **Condition 4**: The `else` block prints 'No', which is incorrect because it does not cover all possible scenarios.

The correct conditions should be:
- If `b == c`, print 'YES'.
- If `b < c`, print 'NO'.
- If `b > c`, print 'YES' if `b` and `c` have the same parity; otherwise, print 'NO'.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly handle the case where `b > c` and the parity check is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
