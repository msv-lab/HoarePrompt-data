### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and iterates over each test case.
   - It then reads `b` and `c` for each test case, which represent the number of moves and the desired number of cubes, respectively.

2. **Conditions for Output**:
   - The condition `if b == c:` checks if the number of moves equals the desired number of cubes. If true, it prints 'YES', which is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes added, Nikita can achieve the desired number of cubes.
   - The condition `elif b < c:` checks if the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes. If true, it prints 'NO', which is correct because if the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes, it's impossible to achieve the desired number of cubes.
   - The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` checks if the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of moves matches the parity of the desired number of cubes. This is necessary because each move either adds or removes one cube, meaning the parity of the number of moves must match the parity of the desired number of cubes to achieve the desired result.
   - The condition `else:` covers all other cases where the above conditions do not hold, and it prints 'NO'. This is correct because if none of the above conditions are met, it means it's not possible to achieve the desired number of cubes.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The function outputs 'YES' or 'NO' in the required format, matching the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to achieve the desired number of cubes after a given number of moves. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
