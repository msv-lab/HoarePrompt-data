Output: **No**

Explanation: The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `a` must be at least 1.
- `b` is an integer from the input.
- `c` is an integer from the input.
- `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

However, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'No'`. There are no variables or objects within the `print` statement itself that need to be evaluated or described further. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'No'`.
