Output: **No**

Explanation: Based on the initial state provided, the variables and objects are described as follows:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `a` must be at least 1.
- `b` is an integer from the input.
- `c` is an integer from the input.
- `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.
- `i` is `i + 1`, but since `i` is not defined in the initial state, it is not relevant to the print statement.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'No'`, without referencing any of the other variables or objects. Therefore, the output is exactly `'No'`.
