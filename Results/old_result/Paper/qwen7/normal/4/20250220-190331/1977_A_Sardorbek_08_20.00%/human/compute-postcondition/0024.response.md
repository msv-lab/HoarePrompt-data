Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` must be at least 1, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `b` and `c` respectively. It does not affect the values of `t`, `a`, or `q`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but its exact value before incrementation is not specified, so it is described as `i` is `i + 1`.
