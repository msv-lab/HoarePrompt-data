Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500.
- `_` is explicitly given as 3.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that their sum is even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, and `p3` is at least 3.
- The loop continues if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, implying that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` must be even for the loop to terminate.

Given these conditions, let's determine the values of `p1 + p2`:

1. Since the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` must be even, and `p3` is at least 3, `p3` is an odd number (since it cannot be even and still satisfy the condition of being at least 3).
2. For the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` to be even, the sum of `p1` and `p2` must also be even (because the sum of an odd number and an even number is odd).

Therefore, `p1 + p2` must be an even number.

Since the exact values of `p1` and `p2` are not specified, we know only that their sum is even. Thus, the output will be an even number.

Output: **an even number**
