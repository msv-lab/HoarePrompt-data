To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze it step by step:

### Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. If not, it prints `-1`, which is correct because the total points must be even for the given scoring system.

3. **Handling Cases Where `p3 >= p1 + p2`:**
   - If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program prints `p1 + p2`. This is incorrect because this condition alone does not guarantee that the points can be achieved through valid games. For example, if `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 2`, this condition would be true but a valid distribution of points would involve at least one draw.

4. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the maximum number of draws by iterating over possible values of `x` and `y` where `x` is the number of draws involving the first player and `y` is the number of draws involving the second player. However, the logic here is flawed:
     - The condition `if p1 - x <= p2 - y:` is not sufficient to ensure the maximum number of draws.
     - The logic does not account for the possibility of non-draw games where one player wins and the other loses.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the points cannot be achieved through any combination of games.

### Correct Solution

Let's outline a more accurate approach:

1. **Check Total Points Evenness:**
   - Ensure the total points are even.

2. **Calculate Possible Draws:**
   - Use a more systematic approach to find the maximum number of draws.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_draws(p1, p2, p3):
    total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
    if total_points % 2 != 0:
        return -1

    # Calculate the maximum number of draws
    max_draws = 0
    for x in range(p1 + 1):  # x is the number of draws involving the first player
        for y in range(p2 + 1):  # y is the number of draws involving the second player
            z = (total_points - 2 * (x + y)) // 2  # z is the number of wins for the first player
            if x + y + z == p3 and x + y <= p1 + p2:
                max_draws = max(max_draws, x + y)

    return max_draws

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        print(max_draws(p1, p2, p3))

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program has several logical flaws and does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

**Correctness: False**
