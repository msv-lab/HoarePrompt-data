Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `y`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `y >= x`.

3. **Current state of the variables**:
   - `x` is 0.
   - `y` is equal to `p3`.
   - `p3` is an integer less than `p1 + p2` and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even.

4. **Check the current state against the loop condition**:
   - Since `x` is 0, the loop will execute as long as `y >= 0`.
   - Given that `y = p3` and `p3` is an integer, `y` will always be greater than or equal to 0 because `p3` is a non-negative integer (since it is part of an even sum).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The current state already satisfies the condition `y >= x` because `x` is 0 and `y` is an integer (which is always greater than or equal to 0).

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of the variables for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is 0, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `y` is equal to `p3`**
