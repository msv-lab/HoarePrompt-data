Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three non-negative integers \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \) under specific conditions. For each test case, it checks if the sum of \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \) is even. If not, it prints -1 and moves to the next test case. If the sum is even and \( p_3 \) is greater than or equal to \( p_1 + p_2 \), it prints \( p_1 + p_2 \). Otherwise, it enters a loop where it adjusts two variables \( x \) and \( y \) to find a valid solution, printing either \( p_1 - x + p_3 \) if a valid solution is found or \( p_3 \) if no valid solution exists. The function returns a value based on these conditions for each test case.**
