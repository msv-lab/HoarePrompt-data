Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, `x` is 1, `y` is equal to `p3 - 1`, and `(p1 - 1 > p2 - (p3 - 1))**.

Explanation: The variable `y` is decremented by 1, so `y` is now `p3 - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
