Postcondition: `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, and `p3` must be at least 3. If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
