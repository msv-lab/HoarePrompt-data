Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws that could have happened. Specifically, the logic for determining the maximum number of draws is flawed. Hereâ€™s an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input `1 1 2`. According to the problem description, the scores 1, 1, and 2 can be achieved through the following games:
- Player 1 vs Player 2: Draw (1-1)
- Player 1 vs Player 3: Draw (1-1)
- Player 2 vs Player 3: Player 3 wins (2-0)

In this scenario, the maximum number of draws is 2. However, the program incorrectly outputs -1 for this case.

The program checks if `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0` and prints -1 if true, which is unnecessary since the sum of points can be even or odd without affecting the possibility of draws. More importantly, the logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is incorrect. It attempts to find a combination of draws and wins that matches the given scores but fails to handle all cases correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
