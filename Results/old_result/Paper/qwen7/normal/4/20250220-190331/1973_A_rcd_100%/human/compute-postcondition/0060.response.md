Postcondition: `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, then `x` remains 0, `y` remains `p3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` becomes 1, `y` becomes `p3 - 1`, and `(p1 - 1 > p2 - (p3 - 1))` holds true.
