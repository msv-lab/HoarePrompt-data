Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500.
- `_` is 2.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that their sum is even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, and `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`.
- `x` is 0.
- The current value of `y` is `p3`.
- `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`.

We need to determine the value of `p1 - x + p3` and print it.

Given:
- `x = 0`
- `y = p3`

The expression `p1 - x + p3` simplifies to `p1 + p3` because `x = 0`.

Since `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are such that their sum is even, and `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, we know that `p1 + p3` must be an integer. However, the exact values of `p1` and `p3` are not specified, but we know they satisfy the conditions given.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `p1 + p3`.

Output: **p1 + p3**
