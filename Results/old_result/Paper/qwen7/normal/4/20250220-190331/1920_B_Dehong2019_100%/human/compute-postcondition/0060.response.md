Output State: **`ans1` is the value after subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x]` from the previous iteration's value, `i` is `x + 1`, `x` must be less than `k`, and `n` must be such that `i + x < n` holds true.**

Explanation: The value of `ans1` is updated by subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x]` from its previous value. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged, and the conditions on `x` and `n` still hold true.
