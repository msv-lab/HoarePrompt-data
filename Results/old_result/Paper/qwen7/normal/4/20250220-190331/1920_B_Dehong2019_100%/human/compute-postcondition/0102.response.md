Output State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, `i` is `i + x + 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, and `i + x + 1` must be less than `n`.**

Explanation: The line `ans1 += a[i]` increments the value of `ans1` by `a[i]`. The values of `i`, `k`, and the condition that `i + x + 1` must be less than `n` remain unchanged from the initial state.
