Output State: **`ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`, `i` is `i + x + 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `t` is decreased by `2 * x * k`, `i + x` must be less than `n`**

Explanation: The code subtracts `2 * a[i + x]` from `ans1`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `t`, and the condition involving `i + x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
