Output State: **`ans1` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `ans2` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `i` remains `k`, `k` remains the same, `t` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 = sum(a)` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to `ans1`. The other variables (`ans2`, `i`, `k`, `t`, `n`, `x`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The list `a` remains sorted in descending order as no operation that could alter its order was performed.
