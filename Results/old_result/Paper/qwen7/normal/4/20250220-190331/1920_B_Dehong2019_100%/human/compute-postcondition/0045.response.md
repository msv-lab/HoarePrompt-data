Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue if `i` is less than `x`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`
   - `x` must be the same as before

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2 (i.e., `i` becomes 2).
   - `x` remains the same as it did before the loop started.
   - `ans1` is not directly affected by the loop itself but by the loop body, which is omitted here. Therefore, its value remains unchanged.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`, `x` must be the same as before**
