Postcondition: `ans1` is the value after adding `a[i]` to the previous value of `ans1`, `i` is `x + 2`, `x` must be less than `k - 2`, and `n` must be such that `i + x < n` holds true; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is updated to the previous value of `ans1` minus `a[i + x] * 2`. Otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged.
