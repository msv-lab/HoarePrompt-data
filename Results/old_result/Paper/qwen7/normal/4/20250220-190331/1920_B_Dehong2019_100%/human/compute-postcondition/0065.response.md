Output State: **`ans1` is the value after adding `a[i]` to the previous value of `ans1`, `i` is `x + 2`, `x` must be less than `k - 2`, and `n` must be such that `i + x < n` holds true; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`**.

Explanation: The code `ans1 += a[i]` adds the value of `a[i]` to the current value of `ans1`. The values of `i`, `x`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged. The condition `x < k - 2` and `i + x < n` still holds true. `ans2` remains the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` from the previous state.
