Postcondition: `i` is `i + x`, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans1` is the initial sum of all elements in list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements in list `a` plus `a[0]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`, `ans2` is the maximum value between its original value and `ans1`, `t` is decreased by `x * k`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`, and `i + x` is less than `n`.
