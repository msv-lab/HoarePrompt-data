Output State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[4]`, `i` is 5, `k` must be greater than 3, `ans2` is equal to the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation: The line `ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)` does not change the values of `ans1`, `i`, or `k`. It only updates `ans2` to be the maximum value between its current value and `ans1`. Since the initial conditions for `ans1`, `i`, and `k` are unchanged, these variables retain their original states.
