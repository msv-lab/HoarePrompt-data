Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(x)`. The only variables involved here are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `ans1` is `ans1` minus twice the value of `a[1]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `x` remains the same (no specific value given, but it must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue).

6. **Consider the effect of the loop body**: The loop body modifies `ans1` by subtracting twice the value of `a[1]`. However, since we are only asked to update the state for the next iteration, we don't need to explicitly mention `ans1` unless its value changes in a way that affects the loop condition or other variables.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `x` must be greater than or equal to 2**
