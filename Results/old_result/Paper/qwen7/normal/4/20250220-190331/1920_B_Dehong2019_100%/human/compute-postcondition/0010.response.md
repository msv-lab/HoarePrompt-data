Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < x`.

2. **Determine the current values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `ans1` was decreased by `a[previous_i + 1] * 2`.
   - `i` is set to `previous_i + 1`.
   - `x` must be greater than `previous_i + 1`.

3. **Calculate the new value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is set to `previous_i + 1`, if the loop is to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` becomes `previous_i + 2`.

4. **Adjust the condition for `x`:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `x` must still be greater than `previous_i + 1`. Since `previous_i + 1` is now `i - 1`, `x` must be greater than `i`.

5. **Summarize the new state:**
   - `ans1` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `i` is now `previous_i + 2`.
   - `x` must be greater than `previous_i + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`ans1` is decreased by `a[previous_i + 1] * 2`, `i` is `previous_i + 2`, `x` must be greater than `previous_i + 2`**
