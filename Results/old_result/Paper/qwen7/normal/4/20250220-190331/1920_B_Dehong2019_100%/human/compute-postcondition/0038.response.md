Output State: **`ans1` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `ans2` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `i` remains `k`, `k` remains the same, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k, x = map(int, input().split())` takes three inputs separated by spaces and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. However, since the initial values of `ans1`, `ans2`, `i`, `k`, and `t` remain unchanged from their previous states, only the new values for `n`, `k`, and `x` are introduced. The value of `t` is decreased by 1 due to the previous operation outside the given code snippet.
