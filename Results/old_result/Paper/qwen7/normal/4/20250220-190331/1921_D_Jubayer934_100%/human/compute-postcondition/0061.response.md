Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` appended with the absolute difference of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `temp` is `i`. If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` is greater than `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the function does nothing to `ans` and `temp`.
