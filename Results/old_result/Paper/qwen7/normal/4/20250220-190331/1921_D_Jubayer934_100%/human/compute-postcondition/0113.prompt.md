Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than 0, `temp` is the last index where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was met or remains -1 if no such index was found, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The current value of `temp` is not -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(temp, n):
    ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `temp`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list with one element which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `temp + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list with two elements where the first element is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` and the second element is the same as the first element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `temp + 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list with three elements where the first and second elements are the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, and the third element is the same as the first element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
