Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `temp` is equal to `i + 1`, `ans` is a list with one additional element which is the absolute difference between `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If not, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
