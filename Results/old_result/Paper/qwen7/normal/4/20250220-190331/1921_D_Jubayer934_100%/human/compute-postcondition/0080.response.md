Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `temp` is -1, and `ans` contains the absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` for all valid `i` in the range `[0, n]`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `-1` to the variable `temp`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, or `ans`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `temp` now explicitly set to `-1`.
