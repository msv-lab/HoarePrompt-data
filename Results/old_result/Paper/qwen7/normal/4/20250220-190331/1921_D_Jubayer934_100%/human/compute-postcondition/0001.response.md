Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `m`. Since the actual values of `n` and `m` depend on the user's input, they are described as "an integer entered by the user". All other variables remain unchanged, so no additional information is needed.
