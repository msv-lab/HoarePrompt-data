Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `temp` is the last index where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was met or remains -1 if no such index was found, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The current value of `temp` is not -1.**
