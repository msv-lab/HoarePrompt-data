Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `temp` is `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, it implies that we are breaking out of the context where this statement is placed. The values of the variables `i`, `n`, `ans`, and `temp` remain unchanged, and the break indicates that we are exiting the current control structure.
