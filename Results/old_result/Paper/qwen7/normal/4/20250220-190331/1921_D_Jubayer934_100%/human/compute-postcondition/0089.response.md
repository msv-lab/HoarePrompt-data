Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `temp` is equal to `i`, and either the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the element at index `-(n - i)` in `b` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the element at index `i` in `b`, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or there is no else part and the program continues as normal.**
