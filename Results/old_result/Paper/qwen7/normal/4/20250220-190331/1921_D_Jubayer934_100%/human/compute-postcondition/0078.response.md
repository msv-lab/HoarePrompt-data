Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `input()`, which is an integer value. This integer value will determine how many times the loop will run.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `temp` remains `-1`.
   - `ans` contains the absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` for all valid `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`. If `temp` is not `-1`, `ans` includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all valid `i` in the range `[temp, n-1]`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the next value of `input()` will determine if the loop should continue.
   - If the input value is `k`, then the loop will run `k` more times.
   - For each iteration, `i` will increment from its current value (which is `n`) to `n + k - 1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.
   - `temp` remains `-1` unless it is updated within the loop body, but since no such update is mentioned, it stays `-1`.
   - `ans` will be updated based on the new values of `i` and the lists `a` and `b`.

Given that the loop is controlled by the input value and `i` will increment by 1 for each iteration, the next state will depend on the input value. However, since the exact input value is not specified, we can only describe the general state transition.

**State:**
- `i` will be `n + 1` (assuming the input value is 1 for the next iteration).
- `temp` remains `-1`.
- `ans` will include the absolute differences for the new value of `i`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `temp` is `-1`, and `ans` contains the absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` for all valid `i` in the range `[0, n]`. If `temp` is not `-1`, `ans` includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all valid `i` in the range `[temp, n]`.**
