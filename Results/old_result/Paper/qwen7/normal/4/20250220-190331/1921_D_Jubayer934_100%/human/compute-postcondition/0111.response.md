Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `temp` to `n` (exclusive). This means `i` starts at `temp + 1` and increments by 1 until it reaches `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `temp + 1`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `ans` is a list with two elements where the first element is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` and the second element is the same as the first element.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `temp + 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be updated to `temp + 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
   - The value of `ans` does not change within the loop head, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `temp + 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list with two elements where the first element is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` and the second element is the same as the first element**.
