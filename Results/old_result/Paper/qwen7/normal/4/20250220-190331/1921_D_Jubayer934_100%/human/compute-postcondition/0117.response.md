Output State: The list `ans` will contain the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` for all valid indices in the range `[0, n-1]`. If the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is ever met, the list `ans` will include additional absolute differences starting from index `temp` to `n-1`. The variable `temp` will hold the index where this condition was last true, or it will remain `-1` if the condition was never met. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` after the loop completes, indicating that all elements in `a` and `b` have been processed.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the list `ans` will contain the total sum of absolute differences between the elements of lists `a` and `b`, with any necessary adjustments made based on the condition within the loop. The variable `temp` will indicate the last index where the specified condition was true, or it will remain `-1` if the condition was never met.
