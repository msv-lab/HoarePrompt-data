Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n):` statement. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `a` is a list of integers
   - `b` is a list of integers
   - `temp` is 1
   - `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, and `a[1]` and `b[1]`

3. **Adjust the states of `i` and `n` for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `n` must still be greater than 1.

4. **State the new state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be 3
   - `n` must still be greater than 1

5. **Other variables (`a`, `b`, `temp`, and `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head**.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1**
