Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `temp` is equal to `i`, `ans` is a list with one additional element which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. The values of `n`, `temp`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only new information is that `ans` now contains one more element, which is the calculated absolute difference.
