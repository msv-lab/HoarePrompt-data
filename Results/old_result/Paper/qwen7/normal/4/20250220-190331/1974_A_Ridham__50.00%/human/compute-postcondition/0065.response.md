Output State: The output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `result` is a list containing the final values computed for each iteration based on the conditions within the loop. Each element in `result` is either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `screen_require_for_y` is calculated as `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is even, or `y // 2` if `y` is odd, and `extra_screen` is determined by the remaining cells and `space_x`. `x` is the first integer entered for each iteration, `y` is the second integer entered for each iteration, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, and `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y` if `y` is even, or `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - space_y` if `y` is odd. The final state of `result` will contain the sum of `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` for each iteration of the loop.
