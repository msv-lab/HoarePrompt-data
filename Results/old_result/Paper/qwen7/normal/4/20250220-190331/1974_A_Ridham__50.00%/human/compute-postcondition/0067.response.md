Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.**

Given the constraints and the output description, it seems there might be a misunderstanding since the function definition does not include any parameters. Based on the provided format and the natural language description, the function does not accept any parameters and thus does not return anything. The constraints and output cases seem to be related to the internal logic of the function rather than its parameter list.
