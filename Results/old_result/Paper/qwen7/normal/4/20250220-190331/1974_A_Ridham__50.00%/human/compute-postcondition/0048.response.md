Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered; `space_x` is equal to `x`; `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged, `x` and `y` also remain the same as they were initially. The variable `space_x` is still equal to `x`, and now `space_y` is set to `y * 4`.
