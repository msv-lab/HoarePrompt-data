Output State: **`remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2 if y % 2 == 0 else y // 2 + 1) - y * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` depending on whether `y` is even or odd, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `extra_screen` by dividing `extra_space` by 15 and adding 1. The value of `extra_screen` depends on the value of `extra_space`, which in turn depends on the value of `remaining_cells`. Since the exact value of `remaining_cells` is not specified, we keep it in its formula form. All other variables remain unchanged.
