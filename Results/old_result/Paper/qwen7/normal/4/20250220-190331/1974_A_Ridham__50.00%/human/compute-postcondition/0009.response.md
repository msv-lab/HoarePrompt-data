Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`**.

Explanation: The code `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` calculates the integer division of `y` by 2 and assigns the result to `screen_require_for_y`. Since `y` is even, the value of `screen_require_for_y` is `y / 2` rounded down to the nearest whole number. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
