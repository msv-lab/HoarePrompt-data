Postcondition: **`space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `result` is a list containing either two elements: `screen_require_for_y` and the original element, or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, and `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is even, or `y // 2` if `y` is odd. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains two elements. Otherwise, `result` contains `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is calculated based on the remaining cells and `space_x`.**
