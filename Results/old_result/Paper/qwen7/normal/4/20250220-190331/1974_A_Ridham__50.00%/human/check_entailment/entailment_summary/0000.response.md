Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it correctly calculates the space required for \(2 \times 2\) icons, which is \(4\) cells per icon.
3. It handles the scenario where the number of \(2 \times 2\) icons is odd by adding an extra screen.
4. It calculates the remaining space after placing all \(2 \times 2\) icons and checks if the remaining \(1 \times 1\) icons fit within this space.
5. The logic for calculating the number of additional screens needed when the remaining space is insufficient is correct.
6. The final result is compiled into a list and printed correctly.

Given the execution summary and the provided examples, the program appears to handle all scenarios correctly based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
