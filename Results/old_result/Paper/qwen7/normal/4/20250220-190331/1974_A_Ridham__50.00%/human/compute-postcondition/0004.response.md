Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `x` multiplied by 1 to the variable `space_x`. Since multiplying any number by 1 results in the same number, `space_x` is simply assigned the value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
