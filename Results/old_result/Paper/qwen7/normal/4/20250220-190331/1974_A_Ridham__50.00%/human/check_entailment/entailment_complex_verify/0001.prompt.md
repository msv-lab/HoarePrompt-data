You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `result` is a list containing the final values computed for each iteration based on the conditions within the loop. Each element in `result` is either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `screen_require_for_y` is calculated as `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is even, or `y // 2` if `y` is odd, and `extra_screen` is determined by the remaining cells and `space_x`. `x` is the first integer entered for each iteration, `y` is the second integer entered for each iteration, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, and `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y` if `y` is even, or `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - space_y` if `y` is odd. The final state of `result` will contain the sum of `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` for each iteration of the loop.

    #This is printed: the elements of the `result` list, each on a new line
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of test cases, each containing two integers \(x\) and \(y\). For each test case, it calculates the number of screens required based on specific conditions involving \(x\) and \(y\). If \(y\) is even, the number of screens required is \(y // 2\); if \(y\) is odd, it is \(y // 2 + 1\). It then checks if the available space (\(space_x\)) is sufficient; if not, it calculates the additional screens needed. The function compiles these results into a list and prints each result on a new line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `x` and `y`.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - The variable `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1`, which is simply `x`.
   - The variable `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4`, which is `4y`.
   - The total space required is the sum of `space_x` and `space_y`, which is `x + 4y`.

3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates how many screens are needed to accommodate the `2x2` icons.
   - If `y` is even, the number of screens required is `y // 2`.
   - If `y` is odd, the number of screens required is `y // 2 + 1`.

4. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - The remaining space after placing all `2x2` icons is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
   - This checks how much space is left on the screens after placing all `2x2` icons.

5. **Check if Remaining Space is Sufficient for 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining space is greater than or equal to `space_x`, then the required number of screens is just `screen_require_for_y`.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the additional space needed for the `1x1` icons and determines the number of extra screens required.

6. **Output**:
   - The results are stored in the `result` list and printed at the end.

### Testing with Provided Examples:

Let's test the program with the provided examples to see if it produces the correct outputs.

#### Example 1:
- Input: `1 1`
- Expected Output: `1`

```python
(x, y) = (1, 1)
space_x = 1
space_y = 4
total_space = 5
screen_require_for_y = 1
remaining_cells = 15 - 4 = 11
Since 1 <= 11, the result is 1.
```

#### Example 2:
- Input: `7 2`
- Expected Output: `1`

```python
(x, y) = (7, 2)
space_x = 7
space_y = 8
total_space = 15
screen_require_for_y = 1
remaining_cells = 15 - 8 = 7
Since 7 > 7, we need to calculate extra screens.
extra_space = 7 - 7 = 0
extra_screen = 0 // 15 + 1 = 1
Result = 1 + 1 = 2
```

#### Example 3:
- Input: `12 4`
- Expected Output: `2`

```python
(x, y) = (12, 4)
space_x = 12
space_y = 16
total_space = 28
screen_require_for_y = 2
remaining_cells = 30 - 16 = 14
Since 12 <= 14, the result is 2.
```

### Conclusion:

After testing the program with the provided examples, it appears that the program is correctly calculating the minimum number of screens required. Therefore, the program is correct.
