Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(n):`. This means the loop variable is an underscore (`_`), but it doesn't matter what it is called since it's just a placeholder. The key variables here are `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `n > 0`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `result` is a list containing one element, either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`
   - `x` is an input integer
   - `y` is an input integer
   - `space_x` is equal to `x`
   - `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`
   - `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`
   - `remaining_cells` is calculated based on whether `y` is odd or even
   - `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells` if `screen_require_for_y` is in `result`, otherwise `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `n`, we need to decrement `n` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - All other variables remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `n` is decremented by 1, so `n` must be greater than 0 (i.e., `n - 1`).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `result` is a list containing one element, either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4` if `y` is odd, or `15 * (y // 2) - y * 4` if `y` is even, and `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells` if `screen_require_for_y` is in `result`, otherwise `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`.**
