Output State: **`extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4` if `y` is odd, or `15 * (y // 2) - y * 4` if `y` is even, `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `space_x` is divisible by 15, `extra_screen` is equal to `space_x // 15`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `space_x` divided by 15 to `extra_screen`. Since `space_x` is already defined and is divisible by 15, `extra_screen` is calculated directly from `space_x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
