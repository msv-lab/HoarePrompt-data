### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given code step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Input Reading**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `x` and `y`.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - `space_x = x * 1`: This calculates the total space required for 1x1 icons.
   - `space_y = y * 4`: This calculates the total space required for 2x2 icons, which is 4 cells per icon.
   - `total_space = space_y + space_x`: This sums up the total space required for both types of icons.

3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**:
   - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, otherwise `y // 2`.
   - This calculation determines how many screens are needed to accommodate all 2x2 icons. If there are any leftover cells after placing the 2x2 icons, an additional screen is needed.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`: This calculates the remaining cells after placing all 2x2 icons on the required number of screens.

5. **Determining Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons**:
   - If `space_x <= remaining_cells`, it means all 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining cells without needing additional screens.
   - Otherwise, calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons (`extra_screen`).

6. **Result Construction**:
   - The result is constructed by appending the necessary number of screens to the `result` list for each test case.

7. **Output**:
   - The results are printed out, each on a new line.

Given the above analysis, the code appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of screens required. The calculations and conditions seem logically sound and align with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **True**
