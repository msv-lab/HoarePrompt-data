Output State: **`res` is 0, `i` is the index of the last remaining element in the list `a` after all leading zeros have been removed, `len(a)` is the length of the list `a` with all leading zeros removed minus one, and `t` is 0, with the last element of `a` being removed.**

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` was zero, it is removed. The values of `res`, `i`, `len(a)`, and `t` remain unchanged.
