Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list with the last element (which was 0) removed, `i` is the index of the last iteration of the loop.**

The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` must be 0, after executing this line, the last element is removed. All other variables (`res`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
