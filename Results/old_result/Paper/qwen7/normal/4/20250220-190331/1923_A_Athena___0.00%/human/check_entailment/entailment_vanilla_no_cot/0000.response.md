Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program does not account for moving chips to the closest free cell to the left until all chips are in a single block. Instead, it simply removes leading and trailing zeros and counts the number of zeros remaining, which does not ensure that the chips are moved optimally.

To solve the problem correctly, you need to simulate the process of moving chips to the left until all chips are contiguous. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the index of the rightmost chip
        rightmost_chip_index = -1
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            if a[i] == 1:
                rightmost_chip_index = i
                break
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of moves
        res = 0
        for i in range(rightmost_chip_index + 1, n):
            if a[i] == 1:
                res += (i - (rightmost_chip_index + 1))
        
        print(res)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected program finds the rightmost chip and then calculates the number of moves required to bring all other chips to the left of this rightmost chip. This ensures that the chips form a single contiguous block with the minimum number of moves.
