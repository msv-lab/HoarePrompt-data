Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `res` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to remove elements from the beginning of the list `a` as long as the first element is 0. After the loop has executed as many times as there are leading zeros in the list `a`, `a` will eventually become an empty list. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged because the loop only modifies `a`.
Code of the loop:
while a and a[-1] == 0:
    a.pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` does not contain its last element which is 0, `res` is 0
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `res` is 0
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with its last element being a value other than 0, `res` is 0


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
