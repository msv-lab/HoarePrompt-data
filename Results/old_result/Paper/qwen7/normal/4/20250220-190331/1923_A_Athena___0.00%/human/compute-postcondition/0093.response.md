Output State: **`res` is 0, `i` is the index of the last remaining element in the list `a` after all leading zeros have been removed, and the length of `a` is decreased by 1, and `a[-1]` is now 0.**

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since `a[-1]` was originally 0, after popping, the new last element (which is now second last) must also be 0. The value of `res` remains unchanged, and `i` still refers to the index of the last remaining element after removing the leading zeros, which hasn't changed in terms of its reference but the list itself has one less element.
