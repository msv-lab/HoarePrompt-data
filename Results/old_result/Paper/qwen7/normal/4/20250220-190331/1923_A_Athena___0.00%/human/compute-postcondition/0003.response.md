Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual strings using spaces as delimiters, converts each of these strings into integers, and stores them in a list named `a`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
