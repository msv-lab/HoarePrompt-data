Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and t is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, after executing the code, `t` will be an integer that was input by the user and falls within this range. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
