Output State: **`res` is 1, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The line `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Given that `res` was initially 0, after executing this line, `res` becomes 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0, and the precondition that `len(a)` must be at least 1 and the current value of `a[i]` is 0 is still valid.
