The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (number of cells), and a list of `n` integers indicating whether each cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1). For each test case, it removes leading zeros from the list, counts the remaining leading zeros across all test cases, and prints the final list after removing leading zeros. The function then prints the total count of leading zeros removed from all test cases.
