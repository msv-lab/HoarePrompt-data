Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is either an empty list or a list without any leading zeros, `res` is 0.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `a` will no longer have any leading zeros. If there were leading zeros, they would have been removed by the loop. The variable `t` remains unchanged, as does `n` and `res`, since the loop only modifies the list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == 0:
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is either an empty list or a list without any leading zeros, `res` is 1, and `i` is 0. If `a[i]` equals 0, then `res` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is either an empty list or a list without any leading zeros, `res` is 2, `i` is 1, if `a[i]` is 0, `res` is set to 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is either an empty list or a list without any leading zeros, `res` is 3, `i` is 2, if `a[i]` is 0, otherwise the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
