Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but uses predefined variables t (an integer between 1 and 1000), n (an integer between 2 and 50), and a (a list of n integers where each element is between 1 and 10^6). It returns a value based on these predefined variables.**

In natural language, the function `func_2` accepts predefined variables: `t`, which is an integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `n`, which is an integer within the range of 2 to 50; and `a`, which is a list containing `n` integers, each ranging from 1 to 10^6. The function does not define any additional parameters but operates on these predefined variables to produce its output.
