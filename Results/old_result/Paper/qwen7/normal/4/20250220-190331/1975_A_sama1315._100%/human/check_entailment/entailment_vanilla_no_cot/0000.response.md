Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
- The function `func_1` checks if the array can become sorted by concatenating it with itself and then checking if any substring of this concatenated array matches the sorted version of the original array. This approach is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the operation of splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them.
- The function `func_2` reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases, but it relies on `func_1` to determine if an array can be sorted using the described operation. Since `func_1` is incorrect, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to check if the array can be split into two parts such that the first part is greater than or equal to the second part in a way that allows the array to become non-decreasing after the swap. Hereâ€™s a corrected approach:

```python
def can_become_non_decreasing(a):
    n = len(a)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[i] > a[i + 1]:
            # Check if the array can be split at index i and swapped to become non-decreasing
            left = a[:i + 1]
            right = a[i + 1:]
            if left + right == sorted(left + right):
                return 'Yes'
            else:
                return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

def process_test_cases():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[1])
        a = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
        result = can_become_non_decreasing(a)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))

process_test_cases()
```

This solution correctly checks if the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing.
