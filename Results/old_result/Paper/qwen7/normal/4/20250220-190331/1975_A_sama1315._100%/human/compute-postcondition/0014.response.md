Output State: **`t` is a positive integer minus 1, `n` is int(data[8]), `a` is a list of n integers where each element `a_i` is equal to the corresponding elements in `data` from index 8 to 8 + n - 1, `idx` is 9, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(a)` plus the new element `result`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `n` to be the integer value of `data[8]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The index `idx` is updated to `8 + 1 = 9`.
