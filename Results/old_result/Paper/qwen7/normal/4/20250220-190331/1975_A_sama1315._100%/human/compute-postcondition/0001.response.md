Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from `sys.stdin.read`, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `data`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
