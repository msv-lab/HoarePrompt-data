The function `func_1` accepts a list of `n` positive integers (`a`) where `2 <= n <= 50` and each integer in the list is between `1` and `10^6`. It first sorts the list and then concatenates the original list with itself. The function checks if any substring of the concatenated list, whose length is equal to the original list, matches the sorted version of the original list. If such a substring is found, the function returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.
