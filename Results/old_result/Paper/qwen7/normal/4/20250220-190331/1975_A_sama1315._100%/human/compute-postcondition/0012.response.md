Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i is equal to the corresponding elements in `data` from index 8 to 8 + n - 1, `idx` is 8, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(a)` plus the new element `result`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`**.

Explanation: The line `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. Since `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`, the list `results` now contains the original result plus the new element `result`. All other variables remain unchanged.
