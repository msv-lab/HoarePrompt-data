Output State: **`t` is a positive integer minus 1, `n` is int(data[8]), `a` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from index 10 and of length `n`, `idx` is 11, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(a)` plus the new element `result`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`**

Explanation: The code `result = func_1(a)` assigns the return value of `func_1(a)` to the variable `result`. Since `func_1(a)` returns a value, `result` now holds that value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
