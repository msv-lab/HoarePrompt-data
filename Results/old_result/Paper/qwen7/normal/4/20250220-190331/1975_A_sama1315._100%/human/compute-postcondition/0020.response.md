Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable in the loop head is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer minus 1.
   - `n` is `int(data[8])`.
   - `a` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from index 10 and of length `n`.
   - `idx` is 11.
   - `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(a)` plus the new element `result`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`.
   - `results` has an additional element which is `result`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer minus 1, meaning `t` is currently 0 (since it was decremented by 1 in the previous iteration).

5. **Next iteration state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be set to 1 (the initial value before decrementing).
   - All other variables (`n`, `a`, `idx`, `results`, `result`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is 1, `n` is int(data[8]), `a` is a list of integers extracted from data starting from index 10 and of length n, `idx` is 11, `results` is a list containing the result of func_1(a) plus the new element result, `result` is the return value of func_1(a)**.
