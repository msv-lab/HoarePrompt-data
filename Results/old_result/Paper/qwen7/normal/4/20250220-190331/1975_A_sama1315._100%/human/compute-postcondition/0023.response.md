Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is int(data[11]), `a` is a list of integers extracted from data starting from index idx+n and of length n, `idx` is 14, `results` is a list containing the result of func_1(a) plus the new element result, `result` is the return value of func_1(a)**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))` converts the slice of `data` from index `idx` to `idx + n` into a list of integers. This means that the list `a` now contains integers extracted from `data` starting from index `idx` (which is 13) and of length `n` (which is `int(data[11])`). The value of `idx` is updated to `idx + n`, which is 14. All other variables remain unchanged.
