### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect because the logic in `func_1` does not accurately determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided functions to confirm this conclusion.

#### Re-evaluation of `func_1`

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - `sorted_a = sorted(a)` sorts the array `a` in non-decreasing order.

2. **Concatenating the Array with Itself**:
   - `concatenated_a = a + a` creates a new array that is the concatenation of `a` with itself.

3. **Checking Subarrays**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` iterates through possible starting points of subarrays.
   - `if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:` checks if the subarray from index `i` to `i + len(sorted_a)` matches the sorted array.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns `'Yes'`.
   - If no such subarray is found after the loop, it returns `'No'`.

The issue with `func_1` is that it checks if the entire array `a` can be split and rearranged to match the sorted version of `a`. This is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. For example, consider the array `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`. Sorting it gives `[1, 1, 3, 4, 5]`. Concatenating the array with itself and checking subarrays will not help in determining if the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing.

#### Re-evaluation of `func_2`

- `func_2` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- It correctly handles the input reading and processing, but it relies on `func_1` to determine the result, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to check if the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm to find the smallest possible prefix and suffix that can be swapped to make the array non-decreasing.

Here is a corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[i] > a[i + 1]:
            break
    else:
        return 'Yes'
    
    # Find the smallest element greater than a[0]
    min_greater_than_first = float('inf')
    for j in range(1, n):
        if a[j] > a[0] and a[j] < min_greater_than_first:
            min_greater_than_first = a[j]
    
    # Find the position to insert the smallest element greater than a[0]
    pos = -1
    for j in range(n):
        if a[j] == min_greater_than_first:
            pos = j
            break
    
    # Swap the prefix and suffix
    a[:pos+1], a[pos+1:] = a[pos+1:], a[:pos+1]
    
    # Check if the array is now non-decreasing
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[i] > a[i + 1]:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'
```

With this corrected `func_1`, `func_2` will work correctly.

### Final Evaluation

Given the analysis, the original assessment was accurate. The provided program is incorrect because the logic in `func_1` does not accurately determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.

**Final: False**
