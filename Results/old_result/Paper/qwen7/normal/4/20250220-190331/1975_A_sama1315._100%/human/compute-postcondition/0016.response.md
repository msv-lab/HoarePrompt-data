Output State: **`t` is a positive integer minus 1, `n` is int(data[8]), `a` is a list of n integers where each element `a_i` is equal to the corresponding elements in `data` from index 8 to 8 + n - 1, `idx` is 10, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(a)` plus the new element `result`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`, `a` is updated to be a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from index `idx` (which is 10) and of length `n`.**

Explanation: The code updates the list `a` by converting the slice of `data` from index `idx` (which is 10) to `idx + n` (which is 10 + n) into a list of integers using `map(int, ...)` and then converting it to a list. The other variables remain unchanged.
