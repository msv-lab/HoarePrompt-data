Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.
- `p` is a list of counts where each element is the count of a unique element in `l`.
- The maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(k - 1)
```

Here, the value of `k` is an input integer, and the statement simply subtracts 1 from it. Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical result of `k - 1`. However, we know that `k` is an integer, and the expression `k - 1` will evaluate to an integer that is one less than `k`.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is an input integer)**
