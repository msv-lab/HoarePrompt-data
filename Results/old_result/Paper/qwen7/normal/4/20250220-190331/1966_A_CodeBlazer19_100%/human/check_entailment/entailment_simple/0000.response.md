### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Variable Initialization**: The variables `n` and `k` are correctly initialized for each test case. These represent the number of cards and the number of cards to be exchanged, respectively.

3. **Card Count Calculation**: The program uses a list comprehension to count the occurrences of each unique card value in the list `l`. This is done using `p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]`.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - If the maximum count of any card type (`max(p)`) is greater than or equal to `k`, the program prints `k - 1`. This is correct because we can always reduce the count of this card type to `k - 1` by exchanging `k` cards of the same type.
   - Otherwise, the program prints `n`, which means no reduction can be made, and all cards remain.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the maximum count of any card type is less than `k` correctly by printing `n`.
   - It also handles the case where the maximum count is exactly `k` by reducing it to `k - 1`.

6. **Loop Completion**: The loop iterates over all test cases correctly, and the final state of the program matches the expected behavior.

Given the above points, the program logic aligns with the problem statement and correctly computes the minimum number of cards remaining for each test case.

### Correctness:
