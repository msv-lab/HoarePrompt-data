Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`, the new state of `t` remains within this range after executing the code. All other variables (`n`, `k`, and the list `c`) are not affected by this line of code.
