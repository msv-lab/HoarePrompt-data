Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of counts where each element is the count of a unique element in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the maximum value in `p` remains unchanged. If the maximum value in `p` is less than `k`, the maximum value in `p` remains unchanged as well.
