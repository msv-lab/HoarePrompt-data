You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100. The list of integers c represents the numbers written on the cards, where each c_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        
        if max(p) >= k:
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)
        
    #State: t is an integer between 1 and 500, i is 997, n is an input integer, k is an input integer, l is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, p is a list of counts where each element is the count of a unique element in l, and the loop has completed all its iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), followed by pairs of integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100), and a list of integers c (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100). For each test case, the function determines and returns a specific value or result based on the given inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
