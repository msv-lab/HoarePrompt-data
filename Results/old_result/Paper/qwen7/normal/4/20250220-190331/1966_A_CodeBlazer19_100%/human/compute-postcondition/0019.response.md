Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.
   - `p` is a list of counts where each element is the count of a unique element in `l`.
   - `l` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
   - `p` is a list of counts of unique elements in the updated `l`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop continues as long as `i < t`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is an input parameter and does not change within the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `t`.

**State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of counts where each element is the count of a unique element in `l`, `l` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `p` is a list of counts of unique elements in the updated `l`**.
