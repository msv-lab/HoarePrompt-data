Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 500.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
    if max(p) >= k:
        print(k - 1)
    else:
        print(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of counts where each element is the count of a unique element in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the maximum value in `p` remains unchanged. If the maximum value in `p` is less than `k`, the maximum value in `p` remains unchanged as well.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of counts where each element is the count of a unique element in `l`, `l` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `p` is a list of counts of unique elements in the updated `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of counts where each element is the count of a unique element in `l`, and `p` is updated to a list of counts of unique elements in `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
