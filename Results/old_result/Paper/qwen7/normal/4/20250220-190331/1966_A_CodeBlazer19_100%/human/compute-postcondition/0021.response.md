Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of counts where each element is the count of a unique element in `l`, `l` is updated to a list of integers from the input split by spaces and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `l`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states.
