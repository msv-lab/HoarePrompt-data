Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of counts where each element is the count of a unique element in `l`, `l` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `p` is a list of counts of unique elements in the updated `l`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `p` which contains the count of each unique element in the list `l`. This is done using a list comprehension that iterates over the unique elements in `l` (converted to a set to remove duplicates) and counts their occurrences in `l`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
