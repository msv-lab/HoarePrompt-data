### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to generate a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) exist where \( p_i \) divides \( p_{i+1} \) and \( p_j \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).
   - The solution provided uses a specific approach: reversing every other element in the list of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The function `func_1()` generates a list of numbers from 1 to \( n \) and reverses every other element.
   - This means the list will look like: \([1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, \ldots]\) if \( n \) is even, or \([1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, \ldots, n/2+1]\) if \( n \) is odd.

3. **Checking the Validity**:
   - For small values of \( n \):
     - For \( n = 3 \): The permutation is \([1, 3, 2]\). Checking pairs:
       - \( p_1 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_2 = 3 \) and \( p_2 = 3 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 2 \).
     - For \( n = 4 \): The permutation is \([4, 1, 2, 3]\). Checking pairs:
       - \( p_1 = 4 \) does not divide \( p_2 = 1 \) and \( p_2 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 2 \).
       - \( p_3 = 2 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 3 \) and \( p_4 = 3 \) does not divide \( p_1 = 4 \).

4. **General Case Analysis**:
   - By construction, the reversed elements ensure that no two consecutive elements in the sequence can satisfy the divisibility condition because the elements alternate between high and low values.
   - Specifically, for any pair \( (p_i, p_{i+1}) \), if \( p_i \) is large, \( p_{i+1} \) is small, and vice versa, making it impossible for \( p_i \) to divide \( p_{i+1} \).

However, upon closer inspection, we find that the solution does not always meet the problem's requirements. Consider the following counterexample:

- For \( n = 6 \):
  - The permutation generated is \([6, 1, 5, 2, 4, 3]\).
  - Checking pairs:
    - \( p_1 = 6 \) divides \( p_3 = 5 \) (since 6 does not divide 5, this is fine).
    - \( p_2 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 2 \) (fine).
    - \( p_3 = 5 \) does not divide \( p_5 = 4 \) (fine).
    - \( p_4 = 2 \) does not divide \( p_6 = 3 \) (fine).
    - But, \( p_5 = 4 \) divides \( p_1 = 6 \) (since 4 does not divide 6, this is fine).
    - \( p_6 = 3 \) does not divide \( p_2 = 1 \) (fine).

Despite these checks, we can see that the permutation \([6, 1, 5, 2, 4, 3]\) fails the requirement because \( p_5 = 4 \) divides \( p_1 = 6 \).

Therefore, the provided solution does not always generate a valid permutation for all \( n \).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was inaccurate because the solution does not always meet the problem's requirements.

### Final:
Final: **False**
