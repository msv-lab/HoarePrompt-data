Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer equal to the input integer, and the sum of n² over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10⁵.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    sum = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
    print(sum, n + n)
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
        print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has executed from \( j = 1 \) to \( j = n \), updating the sum according to the formula \( \text{sum} += 2i^2 - i \) for each \( i \) from 2 to \( n + 1 \). The final value of `sum` is the result of this summation.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: i is 6, n must be at least 6, j is 6, and sum is 156.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The value of `sum` is 156, `i` is 3, `j` is 6, `n` is at least 6, and `t` is greater than 0.

Based on the provided information, the loop has already executed for 3 iterations with `i` being 3, `j` being 3, and `n` being at least 6. The value of `sum` remains 156 as no additional contributions have been added to it after the first 3 iterations. Since the loop has completed its execution, the final state of the variables is as described. The value of `i` does not change within the loop body, so it remains 3. The value of `j` reaches 6, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `n` must be at least 6, and `t` remains greater than 0, as there is no indication that it would change within the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
