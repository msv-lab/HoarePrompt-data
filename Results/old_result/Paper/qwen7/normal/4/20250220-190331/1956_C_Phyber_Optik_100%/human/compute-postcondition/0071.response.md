Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( t \) and \( n \), where \( 1 \leq t \leq 500 \) and \( 1 \leq n \leq 500 \). For each test case, it calculates a sum based on a specific formula involving squares of integers and prints the sum along with another value derived from \( n \). It then prints multiple lines of output, each containing specific sequences of numbers based on \( n \). After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no return value.**
