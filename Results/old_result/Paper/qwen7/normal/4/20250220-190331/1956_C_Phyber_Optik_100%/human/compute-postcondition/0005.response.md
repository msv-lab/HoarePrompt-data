Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `sum` is 2**

Explanation: The code updates the `sum` variable. Initially, `i` is 2. The expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` simplifies to `(2 * 2 - 1 * 1) * 2`, which is `(4 - 1) * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6 / 3 = 2`. So, `sum` is updated to `sum + 2`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state includes the updated `sum` and the unchanged `t`, `n`, and `i`.
