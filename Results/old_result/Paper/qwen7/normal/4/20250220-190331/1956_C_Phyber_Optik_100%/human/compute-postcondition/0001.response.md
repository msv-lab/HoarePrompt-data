State: **`t` must be at least 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains the variable `_`, which is used as a loop counter. This variable is typically an integer that starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `t`.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 because if `t` is 0, the loop will not run even once.
3. The initial value of `t` being an integer equal to the input integer does not guarantee that the loop will execute; it just means that `t` is set to the input value.
4. The condition that the sum of \( n^2 \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 5 \times 10^5 \) is not relevant to the loop's execution condition since it pertains to the values inside the loop rather than the loop itself.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is that `t` must be at least 1.
