Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The value of `sum` is 156, `i` is 3, `j` is 6, and `t` is greater than 0.

To calculate this, we need to understand how the loop updates the `sum` variable. The loop iterates from `i = 2` to `i = n`, incrementing `i` by 1 each time. For each iteration, the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` is added to `sum`. This simplifies to `2 * i * i`.

Given that after 3 iterations, `i` is 4, we can infer that `n` is at least 4. To find the final value of `sum` after all iterations, we need to continue the loop until `i` exceeds `n`. Since `i` starts at 2 and increments by 1, if `i` is 4 after 3 iterations, `n` must be 4 or more. We need to sum up the contributions of each `i` from 2 to `n`.

Let's calculate the sum step-by-step:
- For `i = 2`: `sum += (2 * 2 - 1 * 1) * 2 = 6`
- For `i = 3`: `sum += (3 * 3 - 2 * 2) * 3 = 21`
- For `i = 4`: `sum += (4 * 4 - 3 * 3) * 4 = 40`

So, after 3 iterations, `sum` is `6 + 21 + 40 = 67`.

Continuing the loop:
- For `i = 5`: `sum += (5 * 5 - 4 * 4) * 5 = 75`

Adding this to the previous sum: `67 + 75 = 142`.

If we assume the loop continues and `n` is at least 6 (since `i` is incremented and must be less than or equal to `n`), we need to add one more term:
- For `i = 6`: `sum += (6 * 6 - 5 * 5) * 6 = 90`

Adding this to the previous sum: `142 + 90 = 232`.

However, given the problem constraints and the provided information, it seems `n` is likely 6 based on the final state of `i` being 4 after 3 iterations. Therefore, the final sum is calculated as follows:
- Sum contributions from `i = 2` to `i = 6`: `6 + 21 + 40 + 66 + 90 = 223`.

But since the exact `n` is not specified beyond the first 3 iterations, and the problem asks for the state after all iterations, we assume `n` is large enough to include all necessary terms, leading to a sum of 156 based on the pattern and the given constraints.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
    print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sum` is 156, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `n` must be at least 6, and `t` is greater than 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sum` is 156, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `n` must be at least 6, and `t` is greater than 0

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sum` is 156, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `n` must be at least 6, and `t` is greater than 0




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
