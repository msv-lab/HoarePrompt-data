Output State: `i` is 6, `n` must be at least 6, and `sum` is 140.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` starting from 2 up to `n`. After 3 iterations, `i` is 4. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` would be 6 (since it increments by 1 each time). For the loop to execute for all possible values of `n`, `n` must be at least 6. The `sum` value is calculated as per the given formula, and after 6 iterations, the sum would be 140.
