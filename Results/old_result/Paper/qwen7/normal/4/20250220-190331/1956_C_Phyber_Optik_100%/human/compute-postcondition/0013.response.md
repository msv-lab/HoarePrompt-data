Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- **Initial State**: `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is `n + 1`, `sum` is 20.
- **Loop Statement**: 
  ```python
  for j in range(1, n + 1):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - The loop variable `j` is used in the loop.
   - The loop condition depends on `n`.

2. **Determine Initial Values**:
   - From the initial state, we know:
     - `t` must be at least 1.
     - `n` must be greater than 4.
     - `i` is `n + 1`.
     - `sum` is 20.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. However, since we already know `n` must be greater than 4, this condition is already satisfied.

4. **Determine Final State After Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will run from `j = 1` to `j = n`.
   - The loop variable `j` will take values from 1 to `n`.
   - Since `i` is set to `n + 1` initially, the loop will run until `j` reaches `n`.

5. **Adjust States**:
   - `t` must be at least 1 (this is already given).
   - `n` must be greater than 4 (this is already given).
   - `i` is `n + 1` (this is already given).
   - `sum` is 20 (this is already given).

Since the loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`, and we need to ensure that the loop can execute, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

### Final State:
- `n` must be greater than 4.
- `i` is `n + 1`.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute correctly.

**State:**
**`t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is `n + 1`, `sum` is 20**
