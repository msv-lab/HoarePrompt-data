State before the loop starts: `sum` is 156, `i` is 3, `j` is 6, and `t` is greater than 0.

The loop head contains the following variables: `j` and `n`. The loop will iterate from `j = 1` to `j = n`. Given that `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each time, the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

Since `j` is 6 at the start, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 6. Additionally, the initial state of `sum` is 156, but this is already consistent with the problem statement, so no adjustment is needed for `sum`.

Therefore, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`. Specifically, `j` should be 1 (the starting point of the loop), and `n` should be at least 6 to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`sum` is 156, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `n` must be at least 6, and `t` is greater than 0**
