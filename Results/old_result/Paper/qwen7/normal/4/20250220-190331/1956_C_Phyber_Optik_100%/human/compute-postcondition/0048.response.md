Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(2, n + 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially 6.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `j` is 6 (not involved in the loop).
   - `sum` is 1 (not involved in the loop).
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (not involved in the loop).

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 2). The variable `i` will take values starting from 2 up to `n` (inclusive).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is already set to 6, it will enter the loop as long as `n` is at least 2.
   - Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`, ensuring it is greater than or equal to 2.

5. **Final state adjustment**:
   - `i` is 6.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `j` is 6 (unchanged and not needed for the loop).
   - `sum` is 1 (unchanged and not needed for the loop).
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (unchanged and not needed for the loop).

**State:**
**`i` is 6, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
