Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = n`. This means `i` starts at 2 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n`.

3. **Determine the Current State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `sum` is increased by `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`.
   - `i` is increased by 1.

4. **Calculate the New Value of `i`**:
   - Let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - After the loop body, `i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is `k + 1`.

5. **Check the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` should be checked against `n`.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `i` is updated to `k + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

Given the above steps, let's formulate the answer:

- The variable `i` is increased by 1, so if `i` was `k` before, it is now `k + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`sum` is increased by `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`, `i` is increased by 1, and `i` must be less than or equal to `n`**.
