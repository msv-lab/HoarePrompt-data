Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and the final state of the variables is as follows: `sum` is 156, `i` is 3, `j` is 6, `n` is at least 6, and `t` is greater than 0. The loop has completed its execution, and the values of `sum`, `i`, `j`, `n`, and `t` reflect the state after all iterations.
