To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Identify Variables and Their Values:**
   - There are no explicitly defined variables or objects in the initial state other than the print statement itself. This means we need to infer the values from the context of the print statement.

2. **Analyze the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is: `print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))`
   - This statement will print multiple values separated by spaces.
   - The first value to be printed is `1`.
   - The second value to be printed is `n - j + 1`. Here, `n` and `j` are variables whose values are not explicitly provided in the initial state.
   - The third part of the print statement uses the `*range(1, n + 1)` syntax, which unpacks the range object into individual arguments. This will print all integers from `1` to `n` inclusive.

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - Since `n` and `j` are not specified, we cannot provide their exact values. However, we know that `n - j + 1` will be a positive integer (assuming `n > j - 1`).
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` will generate a sequence of numbers starting from `1` up to `n`.

Given this analysis, the output will be a sequence of numbers starting from `1` up to `n`, with `1` and `n - j + 1` preceding it.

Output: **1, [n - j + 1], 1 2 3 ... n (where n and j are variables, and the range generates numbers from 1 to n)**
