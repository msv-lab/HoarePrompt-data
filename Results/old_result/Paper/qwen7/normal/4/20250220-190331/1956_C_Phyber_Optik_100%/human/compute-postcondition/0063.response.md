Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range defined by `range(1, n + 1)`. This means `j` should be less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sum` is 156 (not directly relevant to the loop head)
   - `i` is 3 (not directly relevant to the loop head)
   - `j` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 6
   - `t` is greater than 0 (not directly relevant to the loop head)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2. Therefore, for the next iteration, `j` will be 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be at least 6.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`sum` is 156, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `n` must be at least 6, and `t` is greater than 0**
