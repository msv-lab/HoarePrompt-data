Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`, `bx` is -1, `a` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input, and `a` is either 1 or not equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code updates `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`. Since `x` and `ax` are both integers, `ax` will now hold the smaller of the two values. All other variables remain unchanged.
