Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is at least 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `a` and `x` respectively. The values of `_`, `t`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new values of `a` and `x` are the integers input by the user.
