Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes variables to track the minimum (`ax`) and maximum (`bx`) values from the constraints of type 1 and type 2.
2. It uses a set `cx` to store the values of `x` from constraints of type 3.
3. For each test case, it checks if the range `[bx, ax]` is valid (i.e., `bx <= ax`). If not, it appends `0` to the result list `r`, indicating no valid `k` values.
4. If the range is valid, it counts how many values in `cx` fall within `[bx, ax]` and subtracts this count from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` to get the number of valid `k` values.
5. The final result for each test case is appended to `r` and printed at the end.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to correctly implement the solution according to the problem statement and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
