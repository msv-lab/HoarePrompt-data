Output State: **`r` is a list containing 0, `t` is at least 0 and does not change during the loop, `_` is 0, `n` is 0, `cx` contains all unique integers `x` entered during the loop, `ax` is the minimum of the smallest `x` entered and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum value among all integers `x` entered, `a` is the last value read from input during the loop, `x` is the last value read from input during the loop, and `bx` is greater than `ax`.**

The code `r.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the list `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
