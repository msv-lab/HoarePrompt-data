Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `_` and `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `t` is at least 1.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `r` is a list.
   - `t` is at least 1.
   - `_` is `n-1`.
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values provided as input.
   - `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values provided as input (or 1000000007 if no valid `x` is provided).
   - `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values provided as input (-1 if no valid `x` is provided).
   - If `bx` is greater than `ax`, then `r` contains 0. Otherwise, `r` contains the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, and `ax`, `bx`, and `tmp` remain unchanged from their states after the loop.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop depends on `t`, we need to decrease `t` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - All other variables (`r`, `_`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, `tmp`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` is decreased by 1, so it becomes `t-1`.
- All other variables remain the same.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`r` is a list, `t` is at least 1 (decreased by 1), `_` is `n-1`, `n` is the input integer, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values provided as input, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values provided as input (or 1000000007 if no valid `x` is provided), `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values provided as input (-1 if no valid `x` is provided), and `tmp` remains unchanged.**
