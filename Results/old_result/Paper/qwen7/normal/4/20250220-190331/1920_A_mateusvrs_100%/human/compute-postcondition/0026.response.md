Postcondition: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`, `bx` is -1, `a` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input, and `a` is either 1 or not equal to 1.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, indicating that regardless of whether `a == 2` or not, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, `a`, and `x` remain consistent with their initial constraints.
