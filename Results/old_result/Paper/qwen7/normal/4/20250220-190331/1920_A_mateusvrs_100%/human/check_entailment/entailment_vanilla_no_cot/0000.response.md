Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It initializes `ax` to a large value (10^9 + 7) and `bx` to -1 to keep track of the maximum lower bound and minimum upper bound of `k`, respectively.
   - It uses a set `cx` to store values of `x` where `k` must not be equal to `x`.
3. **Updating Bounds**:
   - For each constraint, it updates `ax` and `bx` based on the type of constraint:
     - If `a == 1`, it means `k` must be greater than or equal to `x`, so `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
     - If `a == 2`, it means `k` must be less than or equal to `x`, so `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
     - If `a == 3`, it adds `x` to the set `cx` indicating `k` cannot be equal to `x`.
4. **Calculating Valid Range**:
   - If `bx` is greater than `ax`, it means there is no valid `k` that satisfies all constraints, so it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` within the range `[bx, ax]` that do not match any value in `cx` and appends this count to `r`.
5. **Outputting Results**: Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

Given the problem constraints and the guarantees provided, the program correctly handles all scenarios and produces the expected output. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
