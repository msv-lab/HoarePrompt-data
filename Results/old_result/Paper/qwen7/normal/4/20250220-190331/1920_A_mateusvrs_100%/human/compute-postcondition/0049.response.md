Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in cx`. This means the loop iterates over the elements in the variable `cx`.

2. **Understand the loop body behavior**: The loop body increases `tmp` by 1 if `i` is within the range defined by `bx` and `ax` (i.e., `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`).

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is an integer.
   - `bx` is an integer.
   - `ax` is an integer.
   - `tmp` is an integer.

4. **Analyze the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be one of the elements in `cx`.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration (assuming it starts from the first element in `cx`), the next value of `i` will be the next element in `cx`.

5. **Check the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The next value of `i` must be within the range `[bx, ax]` to increase `tmp` by 1.
   - If the next value of `i` is not within this range, `tmp` will remain unchanged.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be the next element in `cx`.
   - `bx` and `ax` remain the same as they are not modified within the loop.
   - `tmp` remains unchanged unless the next `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`.

Given that the exact values of `cx`, `bx`, and `ax` are not provided, we can only express the state in terms of these variables.

**Final State**:
- `i` will be the next element in `cx`.
- `bx` and `ax` remain the same.
- `tmp` remains unchanged unless the next `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is the next element in `cx`, `bx` is the same, `ax` is the same, `tmp` is the same**.
