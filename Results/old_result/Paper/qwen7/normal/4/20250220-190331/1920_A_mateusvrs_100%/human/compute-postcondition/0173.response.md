Output State: **`cx` is a set containing at least one `x` value, `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is increased by 1.**

The code `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Since `tmp` was not initialized before this line, it is assumed to be 0 initially. After executing this line, `tmp` is increased by 1. The other variables (`cx`, `i`, `bx`, and `ax`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
