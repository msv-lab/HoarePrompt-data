Output State: **`r` is a list, `t` is at least 0, `_` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer (either 1 or not 1), `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `cx` was initially either an empty set or a set containing `x`, after adding `x` again, `cx` now contains only `x`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
