Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in cx`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `cx`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition given is:
   - `i` is the next element in `cx`.
   - `bx` is the same.
   - `ax` is the same.
   - If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in `cx`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next value in `cx`.
   - `bx` and `ax` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
   - The condition for incrementing `tmp` does not affect the state adjustment for the loop itself; it only affects the value of `tmp` inside the loop body.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be the next element in `cx`.
   - `bx` remains the same.
   - `ax` remains the same.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is the next element in `cx`, `bx` is the same, `ax` is the same**.
