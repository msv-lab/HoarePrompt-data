t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is either 1, 2, or 3, and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9; there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2; all constraints are unique.
