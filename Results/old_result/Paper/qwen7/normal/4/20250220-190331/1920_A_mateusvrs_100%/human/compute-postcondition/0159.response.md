Postcondition: `_` is 3, `t` is at least 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer. If `a` equals 2, `ax` is updated to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`; otherwise, `cx` remains a set containing `x`.
