Output State: **`ax` is the minimum of `x` and `1000007`, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `1000007`, `bx` is -1, `a` is an integer from the input and is equal to 2, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is not equal to 1**

Explanation: The code updates `ax` to be the minimum value between `x` and `ax`. Given that `x` is an integer from the input and `ax` is initially 1000007, `ax` will take the value of `x` if `x` is less than 1000007, otherwise, it remains 1000007. All other variables remain unchanged.
