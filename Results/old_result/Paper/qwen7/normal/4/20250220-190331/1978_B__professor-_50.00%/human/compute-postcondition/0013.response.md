Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition remains as is. Otherwise, `b` is greater than `a`, and if the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the condition holds as is; otherwise, `b` is less than or equal to `a`.
