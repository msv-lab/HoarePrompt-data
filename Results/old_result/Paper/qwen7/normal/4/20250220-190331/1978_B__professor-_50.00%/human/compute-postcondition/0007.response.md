Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the expression).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer and `b` is greater than `a`.
- The difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`.

We need to evaluate the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2` and convert it to an integer.

Let's break down the expression step-by-step:

1. `2 * b` is twice the value of `b`.
2. Subtracting `n` from `2 * b` gives us `2 * b - n`.
3. Adding 1 to the result gives us `2 * b - n + 1`.
4. Multiplying this by `n` gives us `(2 * b - n + 1) * n`.
5. Dividing the result by 2 gives us `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`.

Since `b > a` and `b - a >= n`, we know that `b - n + 1` is a positive integer. Therefore, the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2` will yield an integer value.

The output will be the integer value of the expression evaluated with the given conditions.

Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)**
