Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 1 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `n` is assigned the first integer from the input.
   - `a` is assigned the second integer from the input.
   - `b` is assigned the third integer from the input.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The expression inside the `print` function is \(\text{int}((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)\).
   - Let's break it down further:
     - `(b - a) / 2` calculates half the difference between `b` and `a`.
     - `(b - a + 1)` is one more than the difference between `b` and `a`.
     - Multiplying these two results gives the product of half the difference and one more than the difference.
     - Adding `a * n` to this product accounts for the contribution of `a` scaled by `n`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The expression evaluates to an integer value, which is then printed.
   - Given the inputs `n`, `a`, and `b`, the exact numerical value depends on these inputs, but the formula is clear.

Therefore, the output will be the result of the expression evaluated with the given inputs `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Output: **int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)**
