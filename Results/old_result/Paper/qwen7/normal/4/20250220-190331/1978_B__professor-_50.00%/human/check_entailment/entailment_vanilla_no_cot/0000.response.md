Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns under the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Condition Analysis**:
   - If \( b \leq a \), it means there is no benefit in changing the price, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - If \( b - a < n \), it means the price difference is less than the number of buns, so Bob should sell the first \( b - a + 1 \) buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price \( a \).
   - If \( b - a \geq n \), it means the price difference is greater than or equal to the number of buns, so Bob should sell all buns at the modified prices starting from \( b \).

The formulas used in the code are correct for calculating the profit in each scenario:
- For \( b \leq a \): The profit is simply \( n \times a \).
- For \( b - a < n \): The profit is calculated using the sum of an arithmetic series for the first \( b - a + 1 \) buns and adding the profit from the remaining \( n - (b - a) \) buns at price \( a \).
- For \( b - a \geq n \): The profit is the sum of the first \( n \) terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from \( b \).

Given these points, the provided solution accurately determines the maximum profit for each test case, making the correctness evaluation **True**.
