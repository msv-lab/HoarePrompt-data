Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n` is assigned the first integer from the input, `a` is assigned the second integer from the input, `b` is assigned the third integer from the input.**

The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.
