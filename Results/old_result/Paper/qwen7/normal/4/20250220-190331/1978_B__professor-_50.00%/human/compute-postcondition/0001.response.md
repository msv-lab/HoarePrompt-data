State: **`t` must be greater than 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t` and the range function, which uses `t` as its argument.
2. For the loop to execute, `range(t)` must produce at least one iteration.
3. The range function will produce at least one iteration if `t` is greater than 0.
4. Therefore, the state of `t` must be adjusted to ensure it is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Hence, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.
