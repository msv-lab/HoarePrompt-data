Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input is read during the execution of the code, the value of `t` is now known, but it is not specified what that value is. However, we know that `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain undefined as they have not been assigned any values yet.
