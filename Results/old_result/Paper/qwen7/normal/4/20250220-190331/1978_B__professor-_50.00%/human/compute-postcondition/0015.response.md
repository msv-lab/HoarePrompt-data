Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, no change occurs.
   - If `b` is greater than `a`, the condition holds as is, or `b` is adjusted so that the difference between `b` and `a` is at least `n`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`. This means the loop iterates `t` times.
   - The loop variable `_` is a dummy variable and does not affect the state directly.

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop iterates based on the value of `t`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.
   - Each iteration of the loop decrements `t` by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1.

4. **Post-Iteration State:**
   - After one iteration, `t` will be reduced by 1.
   - The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since the problem does not mention any modifications to these variables within the loop, they stay the same.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.**
