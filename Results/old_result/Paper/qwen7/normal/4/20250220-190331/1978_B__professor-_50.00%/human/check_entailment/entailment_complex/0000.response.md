Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The logic in the function is designed to handle different scenarios based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`:
   - If `b <= a`, the profit is simply `n * a` because selling all buns at the usual price `a` gives the maximum profit.
   - If `b - a >= n`, the profit is calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `2 * b - n + 1`. This is because selling the first `n` buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price `a` would give the maximum profit.
   - Otherwise, the profit is calculated using a combination of the arithmetic series sum and the usual price `a`.

4. The provided logic matches the problem statement and the examples given.

5. The program processes all test cases sequentially and updates the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` for each case, which is correct.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
