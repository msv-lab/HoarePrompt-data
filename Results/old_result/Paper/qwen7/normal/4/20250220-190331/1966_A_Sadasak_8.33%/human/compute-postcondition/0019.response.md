Output State: **`frequency_table` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique number from the original `arr`, with all counts capped at `k` and `arr` is an empty list**

This means that after processing all elements in `arr`, `frequency_table` will have entries for each unique number found in `arr`, with their counts adjusted to not exceed `k`. The list `arr` itself will be empty as all its elements have been processed.
