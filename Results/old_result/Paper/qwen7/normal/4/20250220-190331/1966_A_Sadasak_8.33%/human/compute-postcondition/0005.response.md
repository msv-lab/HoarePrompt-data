Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `frequency_table[num]` to `k`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, `arr` still contains at least one element, `num` is still the first element of `arr`, and now `frequency_table[num]` is specifically equal to `k`.
