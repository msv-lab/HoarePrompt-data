Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `arr` will be an empty list, and `frequency_table` will contain the count of each unique number in `arr` capped at `k`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each number in `arr`, incrementing its count in `frequency_table`. If the count of any number exceeds `k`, it is reset to `k`. Once all elements in `arr` have been processed, `arr` becomes empty since all elements have been consumed during iteration. The `frequency_table` will then hold the final counts of each unique number from `arr`, ensuring no count exceeds `k`.
