Postcondition: `arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list, and if `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`, the function does not change `frequency_table[num]` and keeps it as `k`. If `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k`, the function sets `frequency_table[num]` to `k`.
