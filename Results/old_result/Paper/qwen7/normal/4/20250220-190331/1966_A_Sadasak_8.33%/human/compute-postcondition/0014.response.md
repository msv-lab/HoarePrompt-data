Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list, and `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `frequency_table[num]` from `k + 1` to `k`. This means that the frequency of `num` in the frequency table is decremented by 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
