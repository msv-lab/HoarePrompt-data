You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    elif k == n:
        print(k - 1)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        if k in freq.values():
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
    return frequency_table



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k` (where 2 ≤ k ≤ 100). It processes `arr` by counting the occurrences of each unique number, ensuring no count exceeds `k`. After processing, it returns a dictionary containing these counts and makes `arr` an empty list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list of card numbers.
   
2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n`. This is correct because if you cannot even choose `k` cards, you can't perform any exchanges, so the number of cards remains `n`.
   - If `k == n`, the program prints `k - 1`. This is also correct because if `k` equals `n`, you can exchange all `n` cards for `k-1` cards.
   - Otherwise, the program calls `func_1` to get the frequency table and checks if `k` exists in the values of this table. If it does, it prints `k - 1`. If not, it prints `n`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function creates a frequency table of the card numbers.
   - It ensures that no value exceeds `k` by setting frequencies greater than `k` to `k`.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` is unnecessary for solving the problem. The problem only requires checking if `k` can be achieved as a frequency, not limiting the frequencies to `k`.

4. **Checking if `k` can be a frequency:**
   - The condition `if k in freq.values()` is not correctly implemented. We need to check if we can reduce the number of cards to `k` or less by performing exchanges.
   - Instead of checking if `k` is a value in the frequency table, we should check if we can reduce the count of any card to less than `k` or if we can achieve exactly `k` cards.

### Correct Implementation

The correct approach would be to:
- Count the occurrences of each card number.
- Check if any card can be reduced to less than `k` or if we can achieve exactly `k` cards.

### Revised Program

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each card
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Check if we can reduce the count of any card to less than k
    min_cards = n
    for count in freq.values():
        if count >= k:
            min_cards = min(min_cards, count % k + (count // k) * (k - 1))
    
    print(min_cards)
```

### Conclusion

The original program has an incorrect implementation for determining the minimum number of cards. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
