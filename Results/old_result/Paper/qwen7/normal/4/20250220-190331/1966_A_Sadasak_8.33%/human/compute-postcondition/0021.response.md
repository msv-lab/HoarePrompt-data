Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k` (where 2 ≤ k ≤ 100). It processes `arr` by counting the occurrences of each unique number, ensuring no count exceeds `k`. After processing, it returns a dictionary containing these counts and makes `arr` an empty list.**
