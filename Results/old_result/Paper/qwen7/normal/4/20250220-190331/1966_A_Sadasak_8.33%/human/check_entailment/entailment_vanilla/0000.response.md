Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Base Cases:**
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n`. This is because if you cannot select `k` cards to exchange, the minimum number of cards you can have is `n`.
   - If `k == n`, the program prints `k - 1`. This is because if you can select all `n` cards to exchange, you will end up with `k - 1` cards.

3. **General Case:**
   - The program calls a function `func_1` to get the frequency table of the card numbers.
   - It checks if `k` exists as a value in the frequency table.
     - If `k` is a value in the frequency table, it prints `k - 1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `n`.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function creates a frequency table for the card numbers.
   - It ensures that no number appears more than `k` times by setting the count to `k` if it exceeds `k`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Handling of Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the base cases (`k > n` and `k == n`).
   - However, the general case logic is flawed. The program assumes that if `k` is not a value in the frequency table, the minimum number of cards is `n`, which is not always true.

2. **Frequency Table Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` ensures that no number appears more than `k` times. This is a good start but does not directly help in determining the minimum number of cards.

3. **General Case Logic:**
   - The logic in the general case is incorrect. The program should consider the distribution of card numbers and their frequencies to determine the minimum number of cards that can remain.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following:

- If any number appears at least `k` times, we can reduce the count of that number to `k-1` and continue the process.
- We need to find the minimum number of distinct numbers that can remain after performing the operations optimally.

### Corrected Program

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Create a frequency table
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Count how many numbers appear at least k times
    count_k_or_more = sum(1 for count in freq.values() if count >= k)
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards
    min_cards = n - count_k_or_more * (k - 1)
    
    print(min_cards)
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the general case. The corrected approach ensures that we count the numbers appearing at least `k` times and calculate the minimum number of cards accordingly.

**Correctness: False**
