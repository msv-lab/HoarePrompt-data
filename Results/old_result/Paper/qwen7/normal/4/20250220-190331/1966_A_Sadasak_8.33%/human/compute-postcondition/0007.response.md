Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element.
   - `num` is the first element of `arr`.
   - `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k+1` if `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k` initially. If `frequency_table[num]` was not greater than `k`, the postcondition remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Head**: 
   - The loop iterates over each element in `arr` using the variable `num`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `num` and `arr`.
   - Since `num` is set to the current element of `arr` in each iteration, we need to update `num` to the next element in `arr`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `arr` must still contain at least one element.

4. **Post-Condition**:
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `arr` must have at least one element left to process.
   - After processing the first element (`num`), `arr` should now be the remaining elements of the original list.

5. **Updated State**:
   - `arr` will now be the list without the first element (i.e., the rest of the elements).
   - `num` will be the next element in the updated `arr`.

Given these points, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element (excluding the first element), `num` is the first element of the updated `arr`, and `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k+1` if `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k` initially. If `frequency_table[num]` was not greater than `k`, the postcondition remains unchanged.**
