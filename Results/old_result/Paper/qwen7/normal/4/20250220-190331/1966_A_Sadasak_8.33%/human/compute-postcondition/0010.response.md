Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element (excluding the first element), `num` is the first element of the updated `arr`, and `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k + 1` if `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k` before the execution of the if statement. If `frequency_table[num]` was not greater than `k`, the values of `arr`, `num`, and `frequency_table` remain unchanged.**
