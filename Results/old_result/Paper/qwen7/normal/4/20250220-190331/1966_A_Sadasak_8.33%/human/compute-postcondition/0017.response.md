Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `arr` will be an empty list, and `frequency_table` will contain the count of each unique number in `arr` capped at `k`.

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `arr` will be empty because all elements have been processed. The `frequency_table` dictionary will contain each unique number from the original `arr` as keys, with their counts capped at `k`. If any number's count exceeded `k` during the loop, it will be set to exactly `k`. All other elements outside of `arr` and `frequency_table` remain unchanged from their initial state.
