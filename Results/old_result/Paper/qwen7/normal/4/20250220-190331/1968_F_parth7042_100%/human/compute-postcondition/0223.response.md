Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 1, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `r` is now the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the same as before (`pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`), `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the same as before (`bisect_left(v1, l)`), `it2` is the same as before (`bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`), and `q` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `r` to the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
