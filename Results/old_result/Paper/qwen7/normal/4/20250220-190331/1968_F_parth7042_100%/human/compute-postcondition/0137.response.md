Output State: **`q` remains greater than or equal to 1, `index` is now `index + 4`, `l` is now `int(data[index - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` is a list containing 'YES', `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` (or the position where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted), `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `it2` using the `bisect_left` function on `v2` and subtracts 1 from the result. The value of `it2` depends on the position of `r` in the sorted list `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
