Output State: **`q` must be greater than or equal to 1, `index` is now `index + 7`, `l` is now `int(data[index - 3])`, `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, and if `x` equals 0, then `results` is now `['YES']`.**

In this output state, the variable `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`. All other variables retain their previous values or conditions as described in the initial state.
