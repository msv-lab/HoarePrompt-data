Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
2. It initializes variables and structures needed for processing the input data.
3. For each test case, it constructs prefix XOR arrays (`pf`) and maps (`mp`) to store indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
4. For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray `[l, r]` using the prefix XOR values and checks if this XOR value is zero.
5. If the XOR value is zero, it directly appends 'YES' to the results list.
6. If the XOR value is non-zero, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to check if there exists a valid split point within the subarray `[l, r]`.
7. The program correctly handles the logic for determining if the subarray is interesting and appends the appropriate result ('YES' or 'NO') to the results list.
8. Finally, it prints the results list with the correct format.

Given the detailed explanation and the structure of the code, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately and correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
