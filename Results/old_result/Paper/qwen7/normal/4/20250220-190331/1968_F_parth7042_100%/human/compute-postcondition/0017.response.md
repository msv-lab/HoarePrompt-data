Output State: **`a[i]' is updated to int(data[index])'; index' is increased by 1; pf[i] is pf[i - 1] XOR a[i]'; mp[pf[i]] is a list containing i**.

Explanation: The code `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the current index `i` to the list `mp[pf[i]]`. This means that `mp[pf[i]]` now contains the value `i` since `pf[i]` is already calculated as `pf[i - 1] XOR a[i]`. The values of `a[i]`, `index`, and `pf[i]` remain as per the initial state, but `mp[pf[i]]` now includes the current index `i`.
