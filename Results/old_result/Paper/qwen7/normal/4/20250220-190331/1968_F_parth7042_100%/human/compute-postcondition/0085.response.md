Output State: **`results` list will have `q + 1` elements, `data` list remains unchanged, `index` is updated to `index + 4`, `l` and `r` are set based on the current values of `data` at the positions determined by `index`, `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index - 2])`, `q` is decremented by 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.**

In this output state, the `pf` list has been initialized to a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. All other variables remain in their previously described states.
