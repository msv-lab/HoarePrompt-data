Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 3, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `r` is int(data[index + 1]), `x` is not yet defined, `v1` is not yet defined, `v2` is not yet defined, `it1` is not yet defined, `it2` is not yet defined, `q` is `q - 1`, `results` contains 'NO' if the conditions for appending 'YES' are not met, otherwise it contains 'YES'**.

This output state reflects that the variable `r` is assigned the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. All other variables remain in their previously described states.
