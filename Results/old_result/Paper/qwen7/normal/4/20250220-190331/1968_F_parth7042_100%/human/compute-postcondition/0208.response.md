Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. The values of `data` and `l` (which was the integer value of `data[index]`) and `r` (which was the integer value of `data[index + 1]`) remain unchanged. After the increment, `l` now corresponds to the integer value of `data[index - 2]` and `r` corresponds to the integer value of `data[index - 1]`.
