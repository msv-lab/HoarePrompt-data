Output State: The `results` list will contain either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions checked within the loop. Specifically, for each iteration, `l` is the integer value from `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value from `data[index - 1]`, and `x` is calculated as `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` is 0, the result for that iteration is 'YES'. Otherwise, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, and `it1` and `it2` are determined using binary search. If `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]` hold, the result for that iteration is 'YES'; otherwise, it is 'NO'. The loop continues until all `q` iterations are completed, and `index` is incremented by 2 for each iteration. The final state of `results` will be a list containing the outcome ('YES' or 'NO') for each of the `q` iterations.

The `data` list remains unchanged, and `index` will be `2 * q` larger than its initial value after all iterations.
