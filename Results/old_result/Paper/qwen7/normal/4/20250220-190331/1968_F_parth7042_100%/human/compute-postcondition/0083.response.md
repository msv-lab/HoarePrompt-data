Output State: **`results` list will have `q + 1` elements, `data` list remains unchanged, `index` is updated to `index + 4`, `l` and `r` are set based on the current values of `data` at the positions determined by `index`, `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index - 2])`, `q` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Initially, `index` was updated to `index + 2 * q + 2`. After this increment, the new value of `index` becomes `index + 4`. The other variables (`results`, `data`, `l`, `r`, `x`, and `q`) remain unaffected by this operation, except that `x` is now assigned the value of `int(data[index - 2])` due to the updated `index`.
