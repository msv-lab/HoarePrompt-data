Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a[i]` is updated to `int(data[index_current + 2])`.
   - `index` is now `index_current + 2`.
   - `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] XOR a[i]`.
   - `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing `i_current + 1`.
   - `mp[pf[i]]` appends `i_current + 1` to itself.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `i` in the loop will be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`, if `i` was at its maximum value (i.e., `n`), it will reset to 1 for the next iteration.
   - All other variables (`a[i]`, `index`, `pf[i]`, and `mp[pf[i]]`) will depend on the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, let's assume `i` was `n` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be `1` (resetting to the start of the range).

Now, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `a[i]` will be updated to `int(data[index_current + 2])` where `i` is now `1`.
- `index` will be `index_current + 2`.
- `pf[1]` will be `pf[0] XOR a[1]`.
- `mp[pf[1]]` will be a list containing `i_current + 1` and will append `i_current + 1` to itself.

Since `i` is resetting to `1`, the new state should reflect this change.

**State:**
- `a[1]` is updated to `int(data[index_current + 2])`.
- `index` is now `index_current + 2`.
- `pf[1]` is `pf[0] XOR a[1]`.
- `mp[pf[1]]` is a list containing `i_current + 1` and appends `i_current + 1` to itself.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`a[1]` is updated to `int(data[index_current + 2])`, `index` is now `index_current + 2`, `pf[1]` is `pf[0] XOR a[1]`, `mp[pf[1]]` is a list containing `i_current + 1` and appends `i_current + 1` to itself.**
