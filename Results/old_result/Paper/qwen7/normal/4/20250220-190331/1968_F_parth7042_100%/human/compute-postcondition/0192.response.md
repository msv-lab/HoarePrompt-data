Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2; the current value of `x` is 0; `results` is a list containing 'YES'.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified within the scope of the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions and values specified in the initial state are still valid after the execution of the `continue` statement.
