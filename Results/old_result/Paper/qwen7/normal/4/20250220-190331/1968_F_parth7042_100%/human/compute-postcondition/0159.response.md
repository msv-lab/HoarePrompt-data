Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `q` is the total number of iterations the loop ran. `index` is now `index + 2 * q`, `l` is `int(data[index - 2 * q])`, `r` is `int(data[index - 2 * q + 1])` for the last iteration, and `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]` for the same iteration. `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]` and `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]` for the last iteration. `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in `v1`, and `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1` for the last iteration. `results` is a list that contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]`. If the condition is met for any iteration, 'YES' is appended to `results`; otherwise, 'NO' is appended. The final state of `results` will be a list of 'YES' and 'NO' values corresponding to each iteration of the loop.
