Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 3, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the same as before (`pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`), `v1` is the same as before (`mp[pf[r]]`), `v2` is the same as before (`mp[pf[l - 1]]`), `it1` is the same as before (`bisect_left(v1, l)`), `it2` is the same as before (`bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`), and `q` is `q - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Therefore, `index` now has the value of its original value plus 2. The other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by this line of code.
