Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 5, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is int(data[index + 1]), `x` is not yet defined, `v1` is not yet defined, `v2` is not yet defined, `it1` is not yet defined, `it2` is not yet defined, `q` is `q - 1`, `results` contains 'NO' if the conditions for appending 'YES' are not met, otherwise it contains 'YES'**.

Explanation: The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Initially, `index` was `index + 3`. After the increment, `index` becomes `index + 5`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
