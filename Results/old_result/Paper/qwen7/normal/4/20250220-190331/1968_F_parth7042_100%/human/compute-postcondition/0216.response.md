Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of bisect_left(v1, l)**

Explanation: The code `it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)` calculates the index of the first occurrence of `l` in the sorted list `v1`. This does not change the values of `data`, `index`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, or `v2`. Instead, it assigns the result of the `bisect_left` function to `it1`. Since the exact value of `l` is not specified, `it1` will be the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to keep the list sorted.
