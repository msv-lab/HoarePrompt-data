Output State: **`results` list will have `q + 1` elements, `data` list remains unchanged, `index` is updated to `index + 2 * q + 2`, `l` and `r` are set based on the current values of `data` at the positions determined by `index`, `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, `q` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `q` by assigning it the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. The other variables (`results`, `data`, `index`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, and `q`) remain unchanged except for the following updates:
- `index` is updated to `index + 2 * q + 2` (since `q` was already updated).
- `q` is decremented by 1.
