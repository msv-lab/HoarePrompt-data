Output State: **`i` is 3; `a[3]` is equal to `data[index]` as an integer.**

The code `a[i] = int(data[index])` updates the list `a` such that the element at index `i` (which is 3) is set to the integer value of `data[index]`. The initial value of `i` is 3, and since no other changes are made to `i` or `n`, those variables retain their initial values.
