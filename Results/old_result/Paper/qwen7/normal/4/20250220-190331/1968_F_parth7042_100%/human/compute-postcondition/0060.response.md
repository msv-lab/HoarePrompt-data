Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 3, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `q` is `q - 1`, `v1` is updated to `mp[pf[r]]`, `results` is appended with 'YES'**.

This means that the list `results` has been appended with the string `'YES'`. All other variables retain their previous values or expressions as described in the initial state, except for `v1` which is updated to `mp[pf[r]]`.
