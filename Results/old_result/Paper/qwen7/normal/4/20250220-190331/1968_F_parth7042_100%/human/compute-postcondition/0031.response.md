Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is unchanged, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`**.

This means that the value of `r` is set to the integer value of the element at index `index + 1` in the list `data`. The states of `data`, `index`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
