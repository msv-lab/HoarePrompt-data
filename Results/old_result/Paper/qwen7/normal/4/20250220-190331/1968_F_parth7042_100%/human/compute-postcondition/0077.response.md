Postcondition: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 5, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is int(data[index + 1]), `x` is pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1], `v1` is mp[pf[r]], `v2` is mp[pf[l - 1]], `it1` is the result of bisect_left(v1, l), `it2` is bisect_left(v2, r) - 1, `q` is `q - 1`, `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO' and we continue to the next iteration.**
