Output State: **`q` must be greater than or equal to 1, `index` is now `index + 5`, `l` is now `int(data[index - 1])`, `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `r` to be the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. The value of `index` was previously updated to `index + 5`, so `r` is now set to `int(data[index + 1])`. The values of `q` and `l` remain unchanged from their previous states.
