Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]; index` is increased by 2.**

The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. The values of `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
