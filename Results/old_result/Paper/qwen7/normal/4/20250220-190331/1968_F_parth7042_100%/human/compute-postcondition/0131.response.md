Output State: **`q` remains greater than or equal to 1, `index` is now `index + 4`, `l` is now `int(data[index - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` is a list containing 'YES', `continue` statement is executed.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no further operations are specified after the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
