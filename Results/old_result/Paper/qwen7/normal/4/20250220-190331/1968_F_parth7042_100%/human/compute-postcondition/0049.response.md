Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 1, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `r` is the same as before (integer value of `data[index - 1]`), `x` is the same as before (`pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`), `v1` is the same as before (`mp[pf[r]]`), `v2` is the same as before (`mp[pf[l - 1]]`), `it1` is the same as before (`bisect_left(v1, l)`), `it2` is the same as before (`bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`), and `q` is `q - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to `l`. Since `index` was previously `index + 2`, after this assignment, `index` becomes `index + 1`. The values of `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` remain unchanged because they depend on the values of `data[index - 2]` and `data[index - 1]`, which have not been altered. The value of `q` is decremented by 1.
