Output State: **`q` must be greater than or equal to 1, `index` is now `index + 7`, `l` is now `int(data[index - 3])`, `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the list `v1`, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `results` is now `['NO']`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('NO')` appends the string 'NO' to the list `results`. This does not affect the values of `q`, `index`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged. The only new information is that `results` now contains the element 'NO'.
