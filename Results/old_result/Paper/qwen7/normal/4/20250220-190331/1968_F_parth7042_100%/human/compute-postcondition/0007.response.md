Output State: **`index` is 4, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]`, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `data[index + 1]` to `q`, where `index` is initially 3. Therefore, `q` becomes `data[4]` (since `index + 1` equals 4). The other variables (`index`, `t`, `results`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
