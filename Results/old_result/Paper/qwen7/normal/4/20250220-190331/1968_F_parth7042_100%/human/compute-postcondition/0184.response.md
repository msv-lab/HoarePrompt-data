Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` is `n + 1`; `index` is increased by `n - 1`; `pf[n + 1]` is `pf[n] ^ a[n + 1]`; `mp[pf[n + 1]]` contains a list of all integers from 1 to `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n + 1`. After all iterations, the final value of `i` will be `n + 1`. The variable `index` starts from its initial value and increases by 1 in each iteration, so after `n` iterations (since the loop runs `n` times), `index` will be increased by `n - 1` (as it increments before each assignment, starting from `index + 8`). The value of `pf[n + 1]` is computed as the cumulative XOR of all elements in the list `a` up to `a[n + 1]`. Finally, `mp[pf[n + 1]]` will contain all indices from 1 to `n + 1` because each index from 1 to `n + 1` is appended to `mp[pf[i]]` for some `i` during the loop's execution.
