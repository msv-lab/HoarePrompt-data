Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. According to the problem description, the goal is to minimize the number of cards in the hand by exchanging groups of `k` identical cards for `k-1` new cards. However, the program simply prints `k - 1` without considering the actual distribution of card values.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
3 3
1 1 1
```

The expected output should be `1`, because we can exchange all three cards for one new card. However, the program will output `2` because it always prints `k - 1`.

Another example is:
```
4 2
1 1 2 2
```

The expected output should be `2`, as we can exchange two pairs of identical cards for two new cards. However, the program will output `1`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not handle the problem correctly for various inputs, making it incorrect.
