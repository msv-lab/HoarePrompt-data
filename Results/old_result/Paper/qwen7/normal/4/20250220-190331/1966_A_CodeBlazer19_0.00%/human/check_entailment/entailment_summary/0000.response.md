Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program simply prints `k - 1` for each test case without considering the actual distribution of card numbers or performing the required operations to minimize the number of cards.
2. **No Minimization Strategy**: The program does not attempt to reduce the number of cards by exchanging groups of `k` identical cards for `k - 1` new cards. Instead, it always prints `k - 1`, which is not necessarily the minimum number of cards that can be left.
3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the first test case (`5 3`), the program would print `2`, but the correct answer should be `2` only if we can optimally reduce the cards as shown in the example. However, the program does not check if such an optimal reduction is possible.
   - For the fourth test case (`10 4`), the program would print `3`, but the correct answer should be `1` because we can repeatedly exchange 4 cards for 3 cards until only 1 card remains.

Given these points, the program does not implement the logic required to find the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing the allowed operations.

Correctness: **False**
