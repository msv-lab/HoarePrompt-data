Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(t)`.
   - The variable `i` is the loop counter.
   - The variable `t` is the upper limit of the range.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is an integer input from the user, split by space and converted to an integer.
   - `l` is a list of integers input from the user, split by space and converted using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - `t` is the length of the list `l`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is one less than `t` (since the loop runs from 0 to `t-1`).
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become `i + 1`.
   - Since `i` was `t-1` at the end of the previous iteration, `i` will now be `t` for the next iteration.
   - However, the loop will check if `i < t` before executing. Since `i` will be `t`, the condition `i < t` will be false, and the loop will terminate.

5. **Update the state**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented to `t`.
   - The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is determined by the length of the list `l`.

Given this analysis, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers input from the user split by space and converted using map(int, input().split()), `i` is `t`**.
