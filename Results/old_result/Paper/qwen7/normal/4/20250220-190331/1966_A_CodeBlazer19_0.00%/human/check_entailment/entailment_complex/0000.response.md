Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The program simply prints `k - 1` for each test case without considering the actual distribution of card numbers or performing any operations to minimize the number of cards. According to the problem statement, we need to consider the frequency of each card number and perform operations to reduce the number of cards optimally. The provided solution does not account for this and always outputs `k - 1`, which is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
