The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (number of test cases), followed by pairs of integers `n` and `k` (where `n` is the size of the list and `k` is an integer), and a list of `n` integers `c`. For each test case, it prints `k - 1`. After processing all test cases, it outputs nothing explicitly, but the state of the program includes the last processed values of `n`, `k`, and `c`.
