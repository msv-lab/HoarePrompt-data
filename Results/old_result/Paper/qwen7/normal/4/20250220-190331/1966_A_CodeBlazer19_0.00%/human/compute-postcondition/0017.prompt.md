You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100; the list of integers c contains n integers such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100 for each c_i in c.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(k - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed `t` times. For each iteration, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers input from the user split by space and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, and `i` is equal to `t`. After executing the loop, `n` will be the first integer input for the last iteration, `k` will be the second integer input for the last iteration, and `l` will be the list of integers for the last iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be equal to `t`, `n` will be the `n` value from the last iteration, `k` will be the `k` value from the last iteration, and `l` will be the list `l` from the last iteration. All previous inputs for `n`, `k`, and lists `l` will have been processed and printed `k-1` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a test case defined by three components: an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500), a list of integers `c` containing `n` elements (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100 for each element `c_i` in `c`), and an integer `k` (where 2 ≤ k ≤ 100). For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `c`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
