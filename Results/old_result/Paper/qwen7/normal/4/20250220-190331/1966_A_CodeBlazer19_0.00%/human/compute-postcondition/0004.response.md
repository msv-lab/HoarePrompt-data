Based on the initial state described:

- `k` is an integer input from the user, split by space and converted to an integer.
- `l` is a list of integers input from the user, split by space and converted using `map(int, input().split())`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(k - 1)
```

Here, the value of `k` is an integer input from the user. When the `print(k - 1)` statement is executed, it will print `k - 1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **k - 1 (where k is the integer input from the user)**
