Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the integer `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is an input integer.
   - `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < t`. Therefore, for the loop to start executing, `t` must be at least 1 (since `i` starts from 0).

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 so that the loop can start executing. The value of `i` at the start of the loop is 0, which is correct as per the loop initialization.

5. **Final state**: The state should reflect that `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` is 0 at the start of the loop.

**State:**
**`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
