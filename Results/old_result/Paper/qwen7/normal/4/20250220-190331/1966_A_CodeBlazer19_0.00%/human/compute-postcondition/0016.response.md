Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a test case defined by three components: an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500), a list of integers `c` containing `n` elements (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100 for each element `c_i` in `c`), and an integer `k` (where 2 ≤ k ≤ 100). For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `c`.**
