Based on the initial state described:

- `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer.
- `l` is updated to a new list of integers input from the user split by space and converted using `map(int, input().split())`.
- `i` is `t + 1`, but since `t` is not defined in the initial state, it is not relevant for determining the output of the print statement.
- `n` is the first integer input from the user split by space.
- `k` is the second integer input from the user split by space.
- `l` is updated again to a new list of integers input from the user split by space and converted using `map(int, input().split())`.

The print statement is `print(k - 1)`. Here, `k` is the second integer input from the user. Therefore, the print statement will subtract 1 from this integer value.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is the second integer input from the user)**
