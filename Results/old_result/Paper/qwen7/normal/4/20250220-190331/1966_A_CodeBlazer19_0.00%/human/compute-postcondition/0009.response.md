Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the initial state**: 
   - `k` is an integer input from the user, split by space and converted to an integer.
   - `l` is updated to a new list of integers input from the user, split by space and converted using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - `i` is initially set to `t`.
   - `n` is the first integer input from the user, split by space.
   - `k` is the second integer input from the user, split by space.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < t`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was equal to `t`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be `t + 1`.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `k` remains the same (an integer input from the user).
   - `l` remains the same (a list of integers input from the user).
   - `i` is now `t + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same (the first integer input from the user).
   - `k` remains the same (the second integer input from the user).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `l` is updated to a new list of integers input from the user split by space and converted using map(int, input().split()), `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is the first integer input from the user split by space, `k` is the second integer input from the user**.
