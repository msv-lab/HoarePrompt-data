Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, `a` is a list of integers where each element from index 1 to n-4 is equal to the next one, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is 1, `end` is 1, `ans` is 0, and `a[0]` equals `a[-1]`.**

Explanation: The code `st, end = 1, 1` updates the values of `st` and `end` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
