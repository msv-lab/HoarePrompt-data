Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
2. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `l`, `r`, and the condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

3. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `l` is 3.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.
   - `a` is a list of integers where each element from index 1 to n-4 is equal to the next one.
   - `le` is the length of list `a`.
   - `st` is 3.
   - `end` is 1.
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `a[0]` must equal `a[1]`.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]` must be true.
   - Since `l` is 3 and `r` is `n - 1`, for `l < r` to remain true, `r` must be greater than 3.
   - Additionally, for `a[l] == a[l + 1]` to remain true, `a[3]` must equal `a[4]`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `r` is greater than 3.
   - We need to ensure that `a[3]` equals `a[4]`.

Given these points, the adjusted states should be:

State: **`total` is 0, `l` is 3, `r` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers where each element from index 1 to n-4 is equal to the next one, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is 3, `end` is 1, `ans` is 0, and `a[3]` must equal `a[4]`**
