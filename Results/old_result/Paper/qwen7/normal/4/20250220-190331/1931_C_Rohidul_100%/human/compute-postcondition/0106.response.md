Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of n positive integers a where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n for all i. It does not return anything explicitly but processes the data according to the given constraints.**
