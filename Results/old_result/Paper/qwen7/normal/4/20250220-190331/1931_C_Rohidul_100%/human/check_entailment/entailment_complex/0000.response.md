Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation where the operation's cost is the length of the subarray being modified.

2. **Analyze the Code**:
   - The code iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes variables `l` and `r` to track the boundaries of the longest subarray without consecutive duplicates from the start and end respectively.
   - It then counts the number of consecutive identical elements starting from the beginning (`st`) and ending from the end (`end`).
   - The variable `ans` is calculated as the length of the array minus the maximum of `st` and `end`. This is because making the entire array equal to the first or last element would involve changing the least number of elements.
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same, it adjusts the result to account for the overlap in counting `st` and `end`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the longest subarray without consecutive duplicates from both ends.
   - The calculation of `ans` as `le - max(st, end)` ensures that the minimum cost to make all elements equal is found.
   - The adjustment when `a[0] == a[-1]` is necessary to avoid double-counting the overlapping elements, ensuring the result is accurate.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
