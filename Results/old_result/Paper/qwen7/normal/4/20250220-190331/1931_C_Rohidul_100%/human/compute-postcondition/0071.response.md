Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` is 1, `r` is -1, `a` is a list of integers where `a[1] == a[2]` and `a[2] == a[3]` and so on until `a[n-4] == a[n-3]`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is -2, `end` is n - 3, `ans` is 0, and `a[0]` equals `a[-1]`; `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. Since no other variables are affected, their states remain unchanged. The new state includes that `n` is now an integer value obtained from user input.
