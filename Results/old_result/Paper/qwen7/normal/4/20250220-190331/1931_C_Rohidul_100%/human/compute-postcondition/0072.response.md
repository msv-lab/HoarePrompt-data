Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` is 1, `r` is -1, `a` is a list of integers where each element from index 1 to n-4 is equal to the next one, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is -2, `end` is n - 3, `ans` is 0, and `a[0]` equals `a[-1]`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is updated to a list of integers based on input split.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers. This updates the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
