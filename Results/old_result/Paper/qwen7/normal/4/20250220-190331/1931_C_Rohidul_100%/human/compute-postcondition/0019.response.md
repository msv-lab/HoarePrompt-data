Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 3`, `a` is a list of integers, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is `n - 1`, `end` is 2**

Explanation: The code `end += 1` increments the value of `end` by 1. Initially, `end` was set to 1. After executing the code, `end` becomes 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
