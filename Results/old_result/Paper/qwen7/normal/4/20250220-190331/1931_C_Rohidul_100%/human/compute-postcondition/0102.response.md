Postcondition: `total` is 0, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is the original value of `n - 4`, `a` is a list of integers where each element from index 1 to n-4 is equal to the next one, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is 7, `end` is 7, `ans` is 0, and `a[0]` equals `a[-1]`. If `a[0]` equals `a[-1]`, then `ans` is set to 0.
