Postcondition: `total` is 0, `l` is 1, `r` is -1, `a` is a list of integers where `a[1] == a[2]` and `a[2] == a[3]` and so on until `a[n-4] == a[n-3]`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is -2, `end` is n - 3, `ans` is 0, and `a[0]` equals `a[-1]`.

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `a[0] == a[-1]` is true or false, the values of `total`, `l`, `r`, `a`, `le`, `st`, `end`, and `ans` remain as specified in the if part, with `a[0]` being equal to `a[-1]`.
