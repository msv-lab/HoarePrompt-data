Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `total` is 0.
   - `l` is equal to `r`.
   - `r` is the original value of `n - 4`.
   - `a` is a list of integers where each element from index 1 to `n-4` is equal to the next one. This means `a` is a list with repeated values.
   - `le` is the length of list `a`.
   - `st` is 7.
   - `end` is 7.
   - `ans` is 0 if `a[0]` equals `a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` remains 3.

2. **Determine the Value of `ans`:**
   - Since `a` is a list where each element from index 1 to `n-4` is equal to the next one, it implies that `a[0]` (the first element) is equal to `a[-1]` (the last element).
   - Therefore, `ans` will be set to 0.

3. **Print Statement Execution:**
   - The print statement is `print(ans)`.
   - Given that `ans` is 0, the print statement will output 0.

Output: **0**
