Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
2. **Analyze the variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `l`: The left index.
   - `r`: The right index.
   - `a[l]`: The element at the left index.
   - `a[l + 1]`: The element at the next index.

3. **Determine the current state**:
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `le` is the length of list `a` (which is `n`).
   - `st` is 1.
   - `end` is 1.

4. **Check the loop condition with the current state**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]` must be true.
   - Currently, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`. So, `l < r` is true as long as `n > 1`.
   - We need to check if `a[0] == a[1]`.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `l` is 0, we need to ensure that `a[0] == a[1]` for the loop to execute the first time. This means the first two elements of the list `a` must be equal.
   - The current values of `l` and `r` do not need adjustment because they are already set correctly for the loop to potentially start.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that the first two elements of the list `a` are equal.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`total` is 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is 1, `end` is 1, and `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`**
