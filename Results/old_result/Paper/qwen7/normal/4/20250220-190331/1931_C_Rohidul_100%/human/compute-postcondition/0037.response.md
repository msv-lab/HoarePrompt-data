Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 2`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is `n - 1`, `end` is 1, `ans` is `le - (n - 1 + 1)`, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and converts each integer into a list. The values of `total`, `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, `ans`, and `n` remain unchanged. The new list `a` is created based on the user's input, and its length (`le`) is calculated.
