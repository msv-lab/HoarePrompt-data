`st` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `l` is 3, `r` is `n - 2`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[1] == a[2]` and `a[2] == a[3]`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is 4, `end` is 1, `ans` is `le - (n - 1 + 1)`, and `n` must be greater than 4.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` is 3, `r` is `n - 2`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[1] == a[2]` and `a[2] == a[3]`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is 4, `end` is 1, `ans` is `le - (n - 1 + 1)`, and `n` must be greater than 4.**
