The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) positive integers \( a \). For each test case, it calculates the length of the longest subarray where the first and last elements are not part of any consecutive duplicates. Specifically, it counts the number of consecutive identical elements starting from the beginning (`st`) and ending from the end (`end`). If the first and last elements of the list are the same, it adjusts the result accordingly. Finally, it prints the length of the longest subarray that meets the criteria for each test case.
