Output State: `total` is 0, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is `n - 1`, `end` is 1.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `l` will be `n - 1` because the loop continues to decrement `r` and increment `end` until `r` is no longer greater than `l`. Since the loop condition `r > l` was false when the loop terminated (as `l` reached `n - 1` and `r` became `n - 1 - 1`), the final state of `l` and `r` will both be `n - 1`. The value of `st` remains `n - 1` as it is not affected by the loop. The values of `total`, `a`, `le`, and `end` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
