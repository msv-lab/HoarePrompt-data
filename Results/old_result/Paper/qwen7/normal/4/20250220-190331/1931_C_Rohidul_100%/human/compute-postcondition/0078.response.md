Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` is 1, `r` is n - 1, `a` is a list of integers where each element from index 1 to n-4 is equal to the next one, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is 2, `end` is 1, `ans` is 0, and `a[0]` must equal `a[1]`**.

Explanation: The line `st += 1` increments the value of `st` by 1. Initially, `st` is 1, so after executing this line, `st` becomes 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
