Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the array a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n for all i. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    le = len(a)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    st, end = 1, 1
    while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
        l += 1
        st += 1
    while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
        r -= 1
        end += 1
    ans = le - max(st, end)
    if a[0] == a[-1]:
        ans = max(0, le - (st + end))
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `total` is 0, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 2`, `a` is a list of integers, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is `n - 1`, `end` is 1, `ans` is `le - (n - 1 + 1)`. If the first and last elements of list `a` are equal, `ans` is updated to `le - (n - 1 + 1)`. Otherwise, the values of `total`, `l`, `r`, `a`, `le`, `st`, `end`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `total` is 0, `l` is 1, `r` is -1, `a` is a list of integers where `a[1] == a[2]` and `a[2] == a[3]` and so on until `a[n-4] == a[n-3]`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is -2, `end` is n - 3, `ans` is 0, and `a[0]` equals `a[-1]`.

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `a[0] == a[-1]` is true or false, the values of `total`, `l`, `r`, `a`, `le`, `st`, `end`, and `ans` remain as specified in the if part, with `a[0]` being equal to `a[-1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total` is 0, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is the original value of `n - 4`, `a` is a list of integers where each element from index 1 to n-4 is equal to the next one, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is 7, `end` is 7, `ans` is 0 if `a[0]` equals `a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` remains 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
