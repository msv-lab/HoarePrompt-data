Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1 - 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is `n - 1`, `end` is 1, `ans` is `le - max(n - 1, 1)`**.

Explanation: The variable `ans` is calculated as `le - max(st, end)`. Given that `st` is `n - 1` and `end` is 1, the `max(st, end)` will be `n - 1`. Therefore, `ans` is `le - (n - 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
