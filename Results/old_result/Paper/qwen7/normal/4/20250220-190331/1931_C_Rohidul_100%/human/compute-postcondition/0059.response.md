Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` must be decreased to allow `r > l`, `r` is now `n - 7`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[1] == a[2]` and `a[2] == a[3]` and so on until `a[n-5] == a[n-4]`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is -2, `end` is 3, `ans` is -1**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decreases the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was `n - 6`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 7`. All other variables remain unchanged.
