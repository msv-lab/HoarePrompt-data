The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is a string; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`; `kq1` is `a[1]` concatenated with `kq1`; `kq2` is `kq2` plus `a[i]`.**
