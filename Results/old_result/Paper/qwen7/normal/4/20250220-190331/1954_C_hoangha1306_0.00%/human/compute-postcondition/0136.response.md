Postcondition: **`i` is `len(b) - 2`, `a` and `b` are the new input strings, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `q` is `len(b)`, `vt` is either 0 or 1, `x` is `min(int(a[len(b) - 1 - 1]), int(b[len(b) - 1 - 1]))`, and `y` is `max(int(a[len(b) - 1 - 1]), int(b[len(b) - 1 - 1]))`. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are each incremented by `a[i]`. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + str(x)` and `kq2` to `kq2 + str(y)`. If `a[i]` is not greater than `b[i]`, `kq1` is updated to the original `kq1` plus the string representation of `max(int(a[len(b) - 1 - 1]), int(b[len(b) - 1 - 1]))` and `kq2` to `kq2 + str(x).**
