Postcondition: `i` is 3, `a` and `b` are new input strings, `kq1` is the string `a[0]` concatenated with `a[1]` followed by either the string representation of `x` (if `a[i] > b[i]`) or the string representation of `y` (if `a[i] <= b[i]`), `q` is `t`, `vt` is 1, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, and `kq2` is the concatenation of the string `kq2` with the string representation of `a[2]`.
