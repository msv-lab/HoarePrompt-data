Output State: **`i` is 3, `a` and `b` are new input strings, `kq1` is the string `a[0]` concatenated with `a[1]` and then with `a[3]`, `q` is `t`, `vt` is 1, `x` is `min(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))`, and `kq2` is the concatenation of the string `kq2` and the string representation of `a[2]`. We continue to the next iteration or part of the program.**

The `continue` statement does not change any variable values or affect the input strings. It simply moves the control flow to the next iteration of the loop (if in a loop) or the next statement outside the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, all the previous values remain unchanged, and the program continues as if the `continue` statement was not there, except that it skips the rest of the current iteration or block.
