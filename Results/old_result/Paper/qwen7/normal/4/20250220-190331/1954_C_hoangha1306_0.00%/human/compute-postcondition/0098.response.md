Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `len(b) - 1`, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is the concatenation of `kq1` and the string representation of `x` if `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise `kq2` is the string `kq2 + str(x)`. `kq2` is the string representation of `y` if `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise `kq2` is the concatenation of `kq2` and the string representation of `y`. `q` is `len(b)`, `vt` is 1, `x` is `min(int(a[len(b) - 1]), int(b[len(b) - 1]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[len(b) - 1]), int(b[len(b) - 1]))`, and the final values of `kq1` and `kq2` depend on the comparison between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**
