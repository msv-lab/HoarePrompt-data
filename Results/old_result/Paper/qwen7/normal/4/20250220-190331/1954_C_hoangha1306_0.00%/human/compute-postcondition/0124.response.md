The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the overall state of the program. All variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`i` is `len(b) - 2`, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus `a[i]`, `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus `a[i]`, `q` is `len(b)`, `vt` is either 0 or 1, `x` is `min(int(a[len(b) - 1]), int(b[len(b) - 1]))`, and `y` is `max(int(a[len(b) - 1]), int(b[len(b) - 1]))**
