Postcondition: `pairs` is equal to `gap // 2`, `y` retains its previous value, and `ans` is updated as follows: if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`, then `ans` is equal to `ans + gap`; otherwise, `ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `y`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
