Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y is an integer between 0 and n - x; the first line of each test case contains three integers n, x, and y; the second line of each test case contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; the variable `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `y` remain unchanged, and the new variable `a` is introduced with the values read from the input.
