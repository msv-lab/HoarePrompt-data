Output State: **`i` is 3, `t1` is (a[3] + 1) % n**

Explanation: The code snippet `(a[i] + 1) % n` assigns the value of `(a[3] + 1) % n` to `t1`. Here, `i` is 3, so `a[3]` is accessed. However, the value of `a[3]` is not provided, so it remains as `a[3]`. The expression `(a[3] + 1) % n` is calculated and stored in `t1`. The initial value of `i` is 3, which does not change. The condition that `x` must be greater than 3 is not affected by this code snippet.
