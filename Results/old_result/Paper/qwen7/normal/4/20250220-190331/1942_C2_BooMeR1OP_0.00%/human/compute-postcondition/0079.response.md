Functionality: **The function processes input data consisting of multiple test cases. Each test case includes integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates and returns the sum of certain gaps derived from the input data. Specifically, it counts how many gaps of size 1 or 2 are present between consecutive elements in the list of chosen vertices, and then sums up the remaining gaps after adjusting based on the value of y. If y is insufficient to cover all possible pairs, it uses the available y to maximize the sum.**
