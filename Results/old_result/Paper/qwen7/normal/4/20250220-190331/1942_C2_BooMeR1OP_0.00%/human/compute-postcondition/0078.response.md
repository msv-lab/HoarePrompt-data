Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input from standard input. It reads test cases where each test case consists of three integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. For each test case, it checks if the conditions 1 ≤ t (where t is the number of test cases) ≤ 10^4, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x are met. If the conditions are satisfied, it returns information about the test case; otherwise, it handles invalid inputs.**
