Output State: **`pairs` is equal to `gap // 2`, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`, `ans` is equal to `ans + gap`**

Explanation: 
- The initial state is `pairs` is equal to `gap // 2`, `y` retains its previous value, and `ans` is equal to `ans + gap`.
- The code `y -= pairs` subtracts the value of `pairs` from `y`. Since `pairs` is `gap // 2`, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.
- The value of `ans` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it by the given code.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `pairs` remains `gap // 2`
- `y` is now `y - (gap // 2)`
- `ans` remains `ans + gap`
