Output State: **`i` is 2; `x` must be a positive integer; `next_elem` is `a[3 % x] + n`; `gap` is `a[3 % x] + n - a[2] - 1`**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `gap` as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, and `next_elem` is defined as `a[3 % x] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1` else `a[3 % x]`. Since `i` is 2 and does not equal `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[3 % x]`. Therefore, `gap` is calculated as `a[3 % x] + n - a[2] - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
