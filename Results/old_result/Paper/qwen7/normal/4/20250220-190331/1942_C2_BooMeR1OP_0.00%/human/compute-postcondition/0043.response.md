Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` must be a positive integer greater than 2, `next_elem` is `a[4 % x] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[3] - 1`, `gaps` is a list containing `[gap]` if `gap > 0`, otherwise `gaps` remains unchanged, `gaps.append(gap)` has been executed.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `gap` to the list `gaps`. Since `gaps` was previously defined as a list containing one element which is `gap` if `gap > 0`, and now `gap` is appended to `gaps`, the final state of `gaps` is a list containing `[gap]` if `gap > 0`, otherwise it remains unchanged. All other variables (`i`, `x`, `next_elem`, `gap`) retain their previous values.
