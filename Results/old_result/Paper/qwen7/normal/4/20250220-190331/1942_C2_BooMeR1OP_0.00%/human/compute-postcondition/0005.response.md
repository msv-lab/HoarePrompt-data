Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2⋅10^5), and `y` is an integer between 0 and n - x; the first line of each test case contains three integers n, x, and y; the second line of each test case contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; the variable `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, where each element is (num - 1) for each num in the original list `a`; `present` is a set containing elements from the list `a` where each element is (num - 1) for each num in the original list `a`; `ans` is x - 2.**

In this output state, the variable `ans` has been updated to be the value of `x - 2`. All other variables retain their initial conditions as described in the initial state.
