Output State: **`i` is `x`, `next_elem` is `a[x % x] + n` if `x` is greater than 1, otherwise it is `a[1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i-1] - 1` if `gap` is positive, and `gaps` is a sorted list of all positive `gap` values calculated during each iteration where `gap > 0`.**

Explanation: The code sorts the `gaps` list, but since sorting does not change the underlying values of the variables, the values of `i`, `next_elem`, `gap`, and `gaps` remain as described in the initial state. The only change is that `gaps` is now sorted.
