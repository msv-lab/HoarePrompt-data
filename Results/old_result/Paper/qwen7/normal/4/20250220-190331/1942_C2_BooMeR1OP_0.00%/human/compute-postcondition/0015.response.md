Output State: **`i` is 2; `t1` is (a[2] + 1) % n; `t2` is (a[i] + 2) % n and is in `present`; `ans` is 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t2` to `(a[i] + 2) % n`. Given that `i` is 2, `t2` becomes `(a[2] + 2) % n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `t2` is now `(a[2] + 2) % n` and is still in `present`.
