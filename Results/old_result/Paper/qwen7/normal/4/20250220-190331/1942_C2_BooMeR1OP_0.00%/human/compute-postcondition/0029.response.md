Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be a positive integer, `next_elem` is `a[1 % x] + n` if `x` is greater than 1, otherwise it is `a[x % x]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `gap` as the difference between `next_elem` and `a[i]` minus 1. Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` is `a[1]`. The value of `next_elem` depends on the value of `x`: if `x` is greater than 1, `next_elem` is `a[1 % x] + n`; otherwise, `next_elem` is `a[x % x]`. However, since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we keep it as a conditional expression. The value of `gap` is updated accordingly, but the exact numerical value cannot be determined without knowing the values of `a[1]`, `a[1 % x]`, `a[x % x]`, and `n`.
