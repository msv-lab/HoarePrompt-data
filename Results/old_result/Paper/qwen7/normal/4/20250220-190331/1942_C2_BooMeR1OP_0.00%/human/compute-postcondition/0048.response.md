Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `gap` and `gaps`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the `gaps` list.

3. **Determine the initial state of `gaps`**: From the given information, `gaps` is a sorted list of all positive `gap` values calculated during each iteration where `gap > 0`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `gaps`, `gaps` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `gap` in the first iteration will be the first element in the `gaps` list.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `gaps` contains at least one element for the loop to execute. The exact value of `gap` in the first iteration is not specified, but it will be the first element in the sorted list `gaps`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `gaps` must contain at least one element.

**State:**
**`gaps` must contain at least one element**
