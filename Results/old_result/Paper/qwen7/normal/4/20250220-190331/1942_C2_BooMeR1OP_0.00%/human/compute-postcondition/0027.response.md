Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `gaps` is an empty list.
   - `i` will be equal to `x`.
   - `t1` will be `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`.
   - `t2` will be `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`.
   - `ans` will be incremented for each iteration where `t1` is not in `present` and `t2` is in `present`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `x-1`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `x` for the loop to continue executing.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should start from `0` and go up to `x-1` for the loop to execute properly.
   - `x` must be a positive integer for the loop to run at all.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `x`.

State: **`i` is 0, `x` must be a positive integer**
