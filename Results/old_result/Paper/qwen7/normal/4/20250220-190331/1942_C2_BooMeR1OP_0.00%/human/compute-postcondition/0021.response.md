Output State: **`i` is 3; `t2` is (a[3] + 2) % n**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3. The variable `t2` is assigned the value of `(a[i] + 2) % n`, which means `t2` is `(a[3] + 2) % n`. The initial state of `t1` is not relevant to the final state since it is not affected by the given code snippet.
