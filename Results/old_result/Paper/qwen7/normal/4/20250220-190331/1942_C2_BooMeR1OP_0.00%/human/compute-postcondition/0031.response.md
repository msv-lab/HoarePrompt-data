Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be a positive integer, `next_elem` is `a[1 % x] + n` if `x` is greater than 1, otherwise it is `a[x % x]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, `gaps` is a list containing one element which is the current value of `gap`.**

Explanation: The line `gaps.append(gap)` adds the current value of `gap` to the list `gaps`. Since the initial state mentions that the current value of `gap` is greater than 0, `gaps` now contains this value. All other variables remain unchanged.
