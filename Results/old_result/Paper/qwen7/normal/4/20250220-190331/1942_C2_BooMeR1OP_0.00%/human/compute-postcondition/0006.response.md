Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer between 4 and \(10^9\).
- `x` is an integer between 2 and \(\min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5)\).
- `y` is an integer between 0 and \(n - x\).
- The first line of each test case contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`.
- The second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, where each element is `(num - 1)` for each `num` in the original list `a`.
- `present` is a set containing elements from the list `a` where each element is `(num - 1)` for each `num` in the original list `a`.
- `ans` is `x - 2`.

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(x):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Variables in the Loop Head:
- The loop variable `i` is used in the range function, starting from 0 up to `x-1`.

### Adjusting States:
- **`i`**: This variable starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `x-1`. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be 0.
- **`x`**: The value of `x` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. Since `x` is already defined and within the given constraints, no adjustment is needed for `x`.

### Final State:
- We need to ensure that `i` is 0 before the loop starts.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 0**
