Output State: **`ans` is increased by 2 * `y`, `pairs` is equal to `gap // 2`, and `y` is less than `pairs`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by `2 * y`. The value of `pairs` remains unchanged as it is equal to `gap // 2`. Similarly, the condition that `y` is less than `pairs` also remains unchanged.
