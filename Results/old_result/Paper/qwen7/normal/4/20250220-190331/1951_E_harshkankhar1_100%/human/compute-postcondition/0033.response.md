Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n-1`, meaning `i` is the last index of the string `s`.
- `x` is the index where the first non-matching character is found.
- `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- The function `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(2)
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the integer `2` regardless of the values of the other variables or the result of the function call.

Output: **2**
