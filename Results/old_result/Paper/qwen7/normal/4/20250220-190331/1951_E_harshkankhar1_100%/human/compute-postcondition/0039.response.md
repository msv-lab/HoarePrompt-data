Based on the initial state provided:

- The value of `i` is `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- `x` is the index where the first non-matching character is found, and it is neither 1 nor half the length of the string `s`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
