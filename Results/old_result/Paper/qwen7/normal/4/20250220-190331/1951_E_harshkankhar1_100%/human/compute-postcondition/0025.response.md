Output State: **The value of `i` is `n-1`, `x` is either -1 or the index where the first non-matching character is found (if such an index exists), and `n` is the length of the input string `s`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the string `s` minus one (`n-1`), because the loop increments `i` from 1 up to `n-1`. The variable `x` will retain the value it was set to during the loop (either -1 if no non-matching character was found, or the index of the first non-matching character) or remain -1 if no change was made inside the loop. The variable `n` will remain unchanged as it is the length of the input string `s`.
