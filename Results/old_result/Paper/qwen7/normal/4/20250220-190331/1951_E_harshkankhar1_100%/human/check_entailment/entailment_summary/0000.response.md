Reasoning:
- The problem requires checking if a string can be partitioned into substrings where none of the substrings are palindromes.
- `func_1` checks if a given string is a palindrome.
- `func_2` attempts to find a way to partition the string `s` into two non-palindromic substrings.
  - It first checks if the entire string is not a palindrome using `func_1`. If true, it prints "YES" with the whole string as the partition.
  - If the entire string is a palindrome, it looks for the first character that is different from the first character. If found, it splits the string at that point.
  - If no such character is found, it means the string is a palindrome and cannot be split into two non-palindromic substrings, so it prints "NO".
  - If a suitable split is found, it prints "YES" and the two resulting substrings.

Given the problem statement and the behavior described in the execution summary, `func_2` correctly implements the logic to determine if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and handles all edge cases as required.

Correctness: **True**
