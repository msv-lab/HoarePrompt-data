### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

#### Function `func_1(s) -> bool`:
- This function correctly checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.
- It returns `True` if the string is a palindrome, otherwise `False`.

#### Function `func_2()`:
- This function processes the input string `s` and determines if it can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
- It first checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
  - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" followed by the number of parts (1) and the string itself.
  - If `s` is a palindrome, it looks for the first character that is different from the first character of the string.
    - If such a character is found, it sets `x` to the index of this character.
    - If no such character is found (i.e., all characters are the same), it prints "NO".
    - If a different character is found at index `x`, it further checks if the substring starting from `x+1` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[x + 1:])`.
      - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" followed by the number of parts (2) and the two substrings.
      - If `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, it prints "NO" (this condition seems unnecessary and might be a mistake).
      - Otherwise, it prints "YES" followed by the number of parts (2) and the two substrings.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Palindromic Strings:**
   - The logic for checking if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings is flawed.
   - The function only checks for the first differing character and does not ensure that the remaining substring is non-palindromic.
   - For example, the string "sinktheyacht" is correctly identified as non-palindromic, but the function should handle more complex cases like "lllllllll" or "uwuowouwu".

2. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The function does not handle edge cases properly, such as strings with repeated characters or strings that are not easily split into non-palindromic parts.
   - The condition `if x == 1 or x == n // 2:` is unnecessary and might lead to incorrect results.

3. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_2()` uses `input()` which is not defined in the context of a typical Python script. It should use `sys.stdin.readline()` or similar method for handling input in a competitive programming environment.

4. **Partition Logic:**
   - The function does not guarantee that the partitioned substrings are non-palindromic. For example, consider the string "lllllllll". The function will incorrectly identify it as non-palindromic and split it into "l" and "llllllll", which is incorrect.

5. **Multiple Valid Partitions:**
   - The function does not account for multiple valid partitions. For example, the string "uwuowouwu" can be split into "uw uow ouwu" or "uw uow ou wu", but the function only prints one possible partition.

### Conclusion:

The given program is not correct because it fails to properly handle the partitioning logic and edge cases. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final: False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues with the program.
