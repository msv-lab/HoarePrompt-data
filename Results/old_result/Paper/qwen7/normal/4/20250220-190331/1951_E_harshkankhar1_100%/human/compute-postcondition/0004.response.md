Output: **1**

Explanation: The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `s` is an input string.
- `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- `x` is `-1`.
- The function `func_1` applied to the entire string `s` returns `False`.

The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer `1`. Since no other variables or objects are being printed, and the value of `1` is explicitly stated, the output is straightforward.
