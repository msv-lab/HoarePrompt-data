Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `s` contains `arr[0] + arr[1]`**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Initially, `i` is 1, so `s.add(arr[1])` is executed, adding `arr[1]` to the set `s`. Since `s` initially contained `arr[0]`, after adding `arr[1]`, `s` now contains both `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
