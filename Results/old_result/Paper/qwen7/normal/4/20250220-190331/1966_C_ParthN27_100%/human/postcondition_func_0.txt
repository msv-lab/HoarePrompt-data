The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( t \) (number of piles), a positive integer \( n \) (number of stones in each pile), and a list of \( n \) integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. For each test case, the function determines whether Alice or Bob wins based on the initial distribution of stones and prints the winner.
