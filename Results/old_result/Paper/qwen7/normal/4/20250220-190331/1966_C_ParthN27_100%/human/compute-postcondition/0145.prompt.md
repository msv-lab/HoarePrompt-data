Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the list of integers a (length n) represents the initial number of stones in each pile, with 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each pile. The sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = set()
    for i in range(n):
        s.add(arr[i])
    s = list(s)
    s.sort()
    s = [0] + s
    ans = 1
    n = len(s)
    if n == 2:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
                break
            else:
                ans ^= 1
        if ans:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the length of list `s`, and `s` is a list where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the same as the original list `s`. If `n` is equal to 2, `ans` remains 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 if the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` was met at least once for some `i` in the range from 1 to `n-2`; otherwise, `ans` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the length of the sorted list `s`, `ans` is 1, and `s` is a sorted version of the set containing all elements from the list `arr` with 0 at the beginning. If `n` is 2, then `i` is 2 and `ans` remains 1. If `n` is not 2, then `i` is `n - 1` and `ans` is toggled to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `s` is a sorted list containing all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, and the first element of `s` is 0; `ans` is either 1 if `n` is exactly 2, or 0 if `n` is at least 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
