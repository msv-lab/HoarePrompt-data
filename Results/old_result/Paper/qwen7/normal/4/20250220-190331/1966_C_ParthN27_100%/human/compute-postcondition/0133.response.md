Output State: **`i` is in the range [3, n-3], `n` is at least 3, `s` is a sorted list containing all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, and the first element of `s` is 0; if `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, then `ans` is 1 (since `ans ^= 1` flips the value of `ans`), otherwise `ans` remains 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans ^= 1` flips the value of `ans`. If `ans` was 0 before the operation, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
