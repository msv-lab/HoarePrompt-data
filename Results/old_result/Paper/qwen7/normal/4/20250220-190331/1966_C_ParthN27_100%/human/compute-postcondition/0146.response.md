Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of n integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function returns information about the initial number of stones in each pile.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for t, n, and a list of integers representing the number of stones in each of n piles. The function processes these inputs and returns information related to the initial state of the stone piles for each test case.
