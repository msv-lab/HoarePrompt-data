Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**: The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute if `n` is at least 1. The variable `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1` during each iteration of the loop.

Given the initial states:
- `i` is equal to `n`
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` is an empty set
- `ans` remains 1
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` such that `n` is at least 1 and `i` starts from 0 (the default value for `i` in the loop).

Here are the steps to adjust the states:
- Since `i` is initially equal to `n`, and `i` starts from 0 in the loop, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.
- Therefore, we need to ensure `n` is at least 1.

So, the adjusted states should be:
- `i` is 0 (default value for the loop)
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1

The final state to be adjusted is:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
