Output State: `i` is equal to `n`; `n` is a non-negative integer; `s` contains the sum of all elements in `arr` from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its intended iterations. The set `s` will contain the sum of all elements in the list `arr`.
