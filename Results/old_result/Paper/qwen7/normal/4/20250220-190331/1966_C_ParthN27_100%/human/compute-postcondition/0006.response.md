Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `s` contains `arr[0]`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i = 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain a non-negative integer, but its exact value is not specified to change unless explicitly mentioned.
   - The variable `s` does not depend on the loop head and therefore does not need to be adjusted.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. However, since `n` is a non-negative integer and no specific value is given for it to change, we only need to focus on adjusting `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `s` contains `arr[0]`**
