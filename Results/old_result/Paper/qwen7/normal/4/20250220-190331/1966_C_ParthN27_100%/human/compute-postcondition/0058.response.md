Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `s` contains `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the first addition to `s` is `arr[1]`. Since `s` initially contains `arr[0]`, after adding `arr[1]`, `s` now contains both `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 1 remain unchanged.
