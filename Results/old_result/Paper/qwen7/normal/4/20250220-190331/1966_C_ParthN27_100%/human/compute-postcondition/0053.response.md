Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the same as the original list `s`, `ans` remains 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `arr`. The values of `i`, `n`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
