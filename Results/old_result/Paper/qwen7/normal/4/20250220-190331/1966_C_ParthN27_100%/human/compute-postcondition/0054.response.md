Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an empty set, `ans` remains 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The line `s = set()` creates an empty set and assigns it to the variable `s`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `ans`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
