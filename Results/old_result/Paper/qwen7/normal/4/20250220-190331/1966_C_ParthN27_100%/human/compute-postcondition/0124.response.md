Output State: **`i` is within the range [1, n-2], `n` is at least 3, `s` is a sorted list containing all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, and the first element of `s` is 0; `ans` is 0; `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1**

Explanation: The code `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `ans` and 1. Given that initially `ans` is 1, the operation `ans ^= 1` changes the value of `ans` to 0. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
