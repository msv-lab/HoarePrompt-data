Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the length of list `s`, and `ans` is 1 if it was 0 before, or 0 if it was 1 before.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is being XORed with 1. XORing a binary value with 1 will flip that value. If `ans` was 0 before, it becomes 1. If `ans` was 1 before, it becomes 0. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
