Output State: **`l` is 1, `r` must be greater than 1, and `k` must be greater than 0; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `t` is `k % 2`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where the `ans` variable was being checked and updated. The values of other variables (`l`, `r`, `k`, `mi`, `t`, and `ans`) remain unchanged after executing the `break` statement.
