Postcondition: `l` is either 2 or 1, `r` is one less than its original value if `l` is 2, `k` is updated as `k - mi * 2` if `l` is 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[r]`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi` if `l` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1 if `l` is 2, `t` is `k % 2` if `l` is 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
