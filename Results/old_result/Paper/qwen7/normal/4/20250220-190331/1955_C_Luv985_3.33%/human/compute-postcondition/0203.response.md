Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`; `l` is 1; `r` is `n-3`; `ans` is 4.**

The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was `n-2`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n-3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
