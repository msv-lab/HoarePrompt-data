Output State: **`T` is a positive integer less than the original value of `T` by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, k is an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code `k = int(k)` converts the string `k` into an integer. The values of `T` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `T` is still a positive integer less than its original value by 1, `n` is still an integer from the input, and `k` is now an integer from the input.
