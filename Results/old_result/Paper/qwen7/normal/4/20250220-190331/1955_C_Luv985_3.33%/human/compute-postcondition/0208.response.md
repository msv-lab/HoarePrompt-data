Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1; `n` must be at least 2; `k` must be greater than 0; `l` is 1; `r` is `n-2`; `ans` is 3; `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `t` is `k % 2`.** 

This means that after the if-else block executes, `T` remains a positive integer greater than 1, `n` remains at least 2, `k` remains greater than 0, `l` remains 1, `r` remains `n-2`, `ans` is set to 3, `mi` is still the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `t` is `k % 2`. The if condition ensures that if `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0, then `ans` is set to 3. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the if condition's outcome.
