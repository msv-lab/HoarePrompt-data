Output State: **`T` is a positive integer less than the original value of `T` by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings in the original list `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`**.

This means that the variable `r` has been assigned the value `n - 1`. All other variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
