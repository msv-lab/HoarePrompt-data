Postcondition: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is incremented to 1; otherwise, `l` remains 0 and `ans` remains 0.
