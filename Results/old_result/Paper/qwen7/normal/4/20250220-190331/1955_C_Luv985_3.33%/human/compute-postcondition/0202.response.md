Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`; `l` is 1; `r` is `n-2`; `ans` is 4.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` is 3, so after executing the code, `ans` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
