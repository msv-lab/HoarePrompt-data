Output State: **`l` is 1; `r` must be greater than 1; `k` is `k - mi * 2`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[r]`; `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, where `mi` is the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[r]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
