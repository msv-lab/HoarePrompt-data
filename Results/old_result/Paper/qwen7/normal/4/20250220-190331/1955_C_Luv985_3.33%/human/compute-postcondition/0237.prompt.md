Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
while T:
    T -= 1
    n, k = input().split()
    n = int(n)
    k = int(k)
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    ans = 0
    while l < r and k > 0:
        mi = min(a[l], a[r])
        if mi * 2 <= k:
            a[l] -= mi
            a[r] -= mi
            k -= mi * 2
            if a[l] == 0:
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            if a[r] == 0:
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
        else:
            t = k % 2
            if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
                ans += 1
            break
    if l == r:
        ans += k >= a[l]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is `T - total_executions`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is adjusted based on the total number of iterations and the value of `mi * 2` for each iteration, `a` is a list of integers where some elements may be reduced to zero, `l` is equal to `n - ans`, `r` is equal to `l + 1`, `ans` is the total number of times `a[l]` or `a[r]` became zero, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]` when the loop condition is met, and `t` is `0` since `l` equals `r`; if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`, `ans` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `T` is a positive integer less than the original value of `T` by the total number of iterations, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings in the original list `a`, `l` and `r` point to the same index where one of the elements in the list `a` has been reduced to 0, `ans` is the total number of times `a[l]` or `a[r]` was reduced to 0 plus `k >= a[l]`, and `t` is `k % 2` since the if condition `(l == r)` is true.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `T` is a positive integer greater than 1; `n` is an integer converted from the original string `n`; `k` is an integer converted from the original string `k` and is adjusted throughout the loop's iterations; `l` is either 2 or 1; `r` is either `n-3`, `n-2`, or `n-1` depending on the operations performed during the loop; `ans` is the total count of elements in `a` that become zero, which can range from 2 to `n` based on the operations; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` at the last iteration; `a` is modified such that all elements that became zero are at positions `l` to `r`; the loop breaks when `l >= r` or `k <= 0`. If `l == r`, `ans` is incremented by `k >= a[r]` (or `k >= a[l]` since `l == r`).


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
