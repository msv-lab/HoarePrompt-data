Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is a positive integer less than the original value of `T` by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings in the original list `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is a positive integer less than the original value of `T` by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is adjusted according to the if condition, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings in the original list `a`, `l` is 1 or 0, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `ans` is 2 if `mi * 2 <= k` and `a[r]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is 1, and `t` is `k % 2` if the else part is executed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `T` is a positive integer less than the original value of `T` by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is adjusted according to the conditions within the if-else block, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings in the original list `a`, `l` and `r` are updated based on the conditions, `mi` is updated accordingly, `ans` is either incremented by 1 or set to 2 or 3 based on the conditions, and `t` is `k % 2` if the else part is executed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `T` is a positive integer less than the original value of `T` by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` must be less than `r`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings in the original list `a`, `mi` is updated to the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `t` is `k % 2` if the else part is executed, and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi` if the if part is executed, or `l` is increased by 1 and `r` is decreased by 1 if the if part is executed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
