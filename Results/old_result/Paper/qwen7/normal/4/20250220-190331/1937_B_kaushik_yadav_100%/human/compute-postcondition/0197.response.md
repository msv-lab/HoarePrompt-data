Postcondition: `counter` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is the first character of `a` plus `b[1]`, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is 2, `work` is `True`. This is because if `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, then `ans` is updated to the first character of `a` plus `b[1]`, and `i` becomes 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains the first character of `a`, and `i` also becomes 2.
