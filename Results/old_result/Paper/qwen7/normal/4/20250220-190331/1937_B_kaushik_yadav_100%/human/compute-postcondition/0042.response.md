Postcondition: `i` is either 2 or the length of `a` minus 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` must have length greater than 1, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is a string containing either the first character of `a` followed by `a[i-1]` when `i` is the length of `a` minus 1, or the first character of `b` when `i` is 2, and `work` is set to `False`.
