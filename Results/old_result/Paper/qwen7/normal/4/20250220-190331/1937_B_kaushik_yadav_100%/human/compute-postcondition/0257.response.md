Postcondition: **`counter` is 2, `ans` is the concatenation of the first character of either `a` or `b` and all characters from `a` or `b` up to the last character, `j` is 1, `i` is `len(a)`, `work` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and the first characters of `a` and `b` at index 0 are not equal, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This postcondition states that after executing the if-else block, `counter` will be 2, `ans` will contain the concatenation of the first character of either `a` or `b` and all characters from `a` or `b` up to the last character, `j` remains 1, `i` is still the length of `a`, `work` remains `False`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and the first characters of `a` and `b` at index 0 are not equal, or the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
