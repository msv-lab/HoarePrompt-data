Output State: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is an empty string, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is 0, `work` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

The code `i = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
