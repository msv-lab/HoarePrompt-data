Output State: **`ans` is increased by `a[i]`, `i` is set to `len(a)` if it was `len(a) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` increments `ans` by the value of `a[i]`. Additionally, the initial state condition states that `i` must be set to `len(a)` if it was `len(a) - 1`. This means that if `i` was `len(a) - 1`, it will now be set to `len(a)`. If `i` was not `len(a) - 1`, its value remains unchanged.
