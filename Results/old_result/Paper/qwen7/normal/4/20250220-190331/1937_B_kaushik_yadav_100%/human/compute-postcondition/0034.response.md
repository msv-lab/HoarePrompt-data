Output State: **`i` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` must have length greater than 1, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a` followed by `a[i]`, and `work` is set to `False`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 2, so after executing this line, `i` becomes 3. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `work` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
