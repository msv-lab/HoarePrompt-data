Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is the character at index `i` in `b`, `work` is set to True, and the character at index `i` in `b` is not less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` in `b` to the string `ans`. Since `i` is initially 1, `ans` is updated to be the first character of `b` (since `ans` was initially the first character of `a`). All other variables remain unchanged.
