Postcondition: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `ans` contains the concatenation of characters from both `a` and `b` based on the conditions provided, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` equals `len(a)`, `work` is `False`, and if `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'`, then `counter` becomes 1; otherwise, `counter` remains either 1 or 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
