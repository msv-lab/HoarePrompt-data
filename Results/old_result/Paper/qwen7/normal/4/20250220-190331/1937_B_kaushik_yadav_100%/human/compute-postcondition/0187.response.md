Output State: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is the first character of `a`, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is 1, `work` is `True`**.

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `a` to the string `ans`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `ans` becomes the first character of `a`. After this operation, `i` is incremented by 1 (though not explicitly shown in the code, it is implied by the nature of the operation in typical contexts). The other variables (`counter`, `j`, and `work`) remain unchanged.
