Postcondition: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is the first character of either `a` or `b` concatenated with `b[i]` or `a[i]`, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `work` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `len(a)` is greater than 0. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**
