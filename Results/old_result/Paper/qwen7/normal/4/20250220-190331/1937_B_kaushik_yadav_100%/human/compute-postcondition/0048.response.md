Output State: **`ans` is increased by `a[i]`, `i` is set to `len(a)` if it was `len(a) - 1`, `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. If `i` was previously `len(a) - 1`, it is now set to `len(a)`. Otherwise, it is simply incremented by 1. The values of `ans` and `a[i]` remain unchanged from their initial state.
