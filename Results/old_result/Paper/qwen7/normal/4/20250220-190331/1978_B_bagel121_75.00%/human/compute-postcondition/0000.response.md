Output State: **`t` is an input integer, indicating the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. This sets `t` to be a positive integer indicating the number of test cases. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain undefined as they have not been assigned any values yet.
