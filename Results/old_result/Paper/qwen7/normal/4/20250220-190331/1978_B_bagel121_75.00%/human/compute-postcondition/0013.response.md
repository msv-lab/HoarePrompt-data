Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to integers from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into three parts, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The value of `t` is `t - 1` from the initial state, and remains unchanged in terms of its relationship to itself. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are now specific integers based on user input.
