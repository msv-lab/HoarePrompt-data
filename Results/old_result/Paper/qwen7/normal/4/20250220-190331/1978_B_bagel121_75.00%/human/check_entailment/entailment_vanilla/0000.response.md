### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   
2. **Base Case**:
   - If the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`, the function correctly calculates the profit as `n * a`. This is because selling all buns at the usual price would yield the highest profit in this scenario.

3. **Optimal Choice**:
   - If `a < b`, the function calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price. The value of `k` is determined as `min(b - a + 1, n)`, which ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns available (`n`) or the range from `1` to `b - a + 1`.
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - The remaining buns `(n - k)` are sold at the usual price `a`, contributing to the profit as `p2 = (n - k) * a`.

4. **Total Profit Calculation**:
   - The total profit is the sum of `ans` and `p2`, which is correctly printed.

Given the logic and calculations, the provided program correctly implements the solution for the problem statement.
