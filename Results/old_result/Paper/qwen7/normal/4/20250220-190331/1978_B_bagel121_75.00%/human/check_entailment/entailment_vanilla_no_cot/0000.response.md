Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all the buns under the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Base Case Check**: If the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`, it is optimal for Bob to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. This is handled by the condition `if a >= b: print(n * a)`.

3. **Optimal Choice Calculation**: For the case where `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price. The value of `k` is determined by `min(b - a + 1, n)`, which ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns available or the difference between `b` and `a`.

4. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The first part of the profit is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - The second part of the profit is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.

5. **Output**: The total profit is printed for each test case.

Given the problem description and the example test cases, the program accurately computes the maximum profit for each scenario. Therefore, the program is correct.
