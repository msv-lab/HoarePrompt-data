Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, `p2` is `(n - k) * a`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p2` to `(n - k) * a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
