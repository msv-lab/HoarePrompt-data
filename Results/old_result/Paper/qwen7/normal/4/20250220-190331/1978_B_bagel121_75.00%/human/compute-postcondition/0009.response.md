Let's break down the initial state and the calculation step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t > 0`: This is a condition but doesn't affect the calculation directly.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `a < b`: This means `b` is greater than `a`.
   - `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`.
     - `b - a + 1` is the number of integers from `a` to `b` inclusive.
     - `k = min(b - a + 1, n)`.
   - `ans` is calculated as \((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k\).
     - This formula calculates the sum of an arithmetic series from `b - k + 1` to `b`.
   - `p2` is calculated as \((n - k) * a\).

2. **Expression to Print**:
   - The expression to print is `ans + p2`.

Now, let's derive the values step by step:

- **Calculate `k`**:
  - `k = min(b - a + 1, n)`.
  - Since `b - a + 1` is the number of integers from `a` to `b`, it ranges from 1 to `b - a + 1`.

- **Calculate `ans`**:
  - `ans = (b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`.
  - This is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b - k + 1` to `b`.

- **Calculate `p2`**:
  - `p2 = (n - k) * a`.

Finally, the expression to print is `ans + p2`.

Given these calculations, the output will be:

Output: **(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k + (n - k) * a**
