Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer obtained from input, `i` is 0, `b` must be greater than 1, `c` is an integer obtained from input, `d` is an input string, `e` is a string obtained from input, `k` is `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k` and `j` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` to be `j + 1`. Given that `j` was initially set to 2, `k` is now updated to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
