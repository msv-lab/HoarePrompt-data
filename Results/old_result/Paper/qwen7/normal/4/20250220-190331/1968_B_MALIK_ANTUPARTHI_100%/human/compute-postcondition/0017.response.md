Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer obtained from input, `i` is 0, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer obtained from input, `d` is an input string, `e` is a string obtained from input, `k` is either `j` or `c` (whichever is met first), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
