State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer obtained from input, `i` must be 0, `a` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `i` starts at 0 in the `range(a)` function.
2. For the loop to execute, `a` must be a positive integer because `range(a)` generates numbers from 0 to `a-1`.
3. The initial value of `i` is 0.
4. Since `a` is obtained from input, its value is unknown at the start but must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state must be adjusted to reflect these conditions.
