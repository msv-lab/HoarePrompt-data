Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `a`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` will be an integer representing the final position where the last character of `d` was found in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end, or it will be equal to `b` if no characters of `d` are found in `e` after the current value of `k`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be one less than the number of iterations completed.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `a`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` will be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `a` remains unchanged.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not given, we can represent it as `i_end` (where `i_end = i_start + 1`).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `i` is `i_end + 1` (which is `i_start + 2`).
- `a` remains the same.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i_end`, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`k` will be an integer representing the final position where the last character of `d` was found in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end, or it will be equal to `b` if no characters of `d` are found in `e` after the current value of `k`, `i` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `a` remains the same.**

To provide a concrete example, let's assume `i_end` was 5 at the end of the previous iteration:

State: **`k` will be an integer representing the final position where the last character of `d` was found in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end, or it will be equal to `b` if no characters of `d` are found in `e` after the current value of `k`, `i` is 6, and `a` remains the same.**

In general form:
State: **`k` will be an integer representing the final position where the last character of `d` was found in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end, or it will be equal to `b` if no characters of `d` are found in `e` after the current value of `k`, `i` is `i_end + 1`, and `a` remains the same.**
