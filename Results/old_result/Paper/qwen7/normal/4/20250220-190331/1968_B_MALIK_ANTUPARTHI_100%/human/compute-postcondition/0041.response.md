Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer obtained from input, `i` is 1, `b` is the first integer obtained from input, `c` is the second integer obtained from input, `d` is a new input string, `e` is a string obtained from input, and `k` is either the index of the last character of `d` in `e` starting from `k` (if all characters of `d` are found in `e`), or the value of `j` when no more characters of `d` can be found in `e[k:]`; `e` is updated to the new input string.**

Explanation: The code `e = input()` takes a new input string and assigns it to the variable `e`. All other variables remain unchanged.
