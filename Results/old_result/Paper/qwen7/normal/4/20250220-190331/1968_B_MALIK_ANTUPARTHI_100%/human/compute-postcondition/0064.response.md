Postcondition: `d` is a list, `j` is incremented by 1, and `k` is recalculated as `k = (j + 1) + 1 + e[j + 1:].index(d[j + 1]) + 1 + j + 1`. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the if condition is not met, `k` is recalculated as `k = j + 2 + e[k:].index(d[j + 1])`, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
