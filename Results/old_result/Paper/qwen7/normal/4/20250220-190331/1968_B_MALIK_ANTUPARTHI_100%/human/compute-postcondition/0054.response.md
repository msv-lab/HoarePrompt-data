Postcondition: `d` is a list, `j` is an index within the range of `d`, and `e` is a list. If `d[j]` is found in the sublist of `e` starting from index `k` to the end, then `k` is set to `j + 1 + e[k:].index(d[j])`, and either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `k` equals `j` if `j` equals `b - 1`. If `d[j]` is not found in the sublist of `e` starting from index `k` to the end, then `k` equals `j`, and we break out of the loop or operation we were inside.
