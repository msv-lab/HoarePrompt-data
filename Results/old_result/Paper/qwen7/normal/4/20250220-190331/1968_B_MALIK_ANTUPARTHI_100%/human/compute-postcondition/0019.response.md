Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer obtained from input, `i` is 0, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer obtained from input, `d` is an input string, `e` is a string obtained from input, `k` is `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`, `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `k` by calculating the index of the substring `d[j]` (which is `d[1]` since `j` is 1) starting from position `k` in the string `e`. This index is then added to `1 + k` to get the final value of `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
