Output State: **`d` is a list, `j` is `j + 1`, `k` is `j + 2 + e[k:].index(d[j + 1])`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement we were inside. The values of `d`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify them.
