Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head defines the variables `j` and `b`.
2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postconditions are:
   - `b` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is `i_end + 1`
   - `a` remains the same
   - `d` is an input string
   - `e` is an input string
   - `k` is either `j` or `k == c` or `j == b - 1`
   - `j` is 0

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: The loop runs as long as `j < b`. Since `j` is currently 0 and `b` must be greater than 0, the loop can execute again if `j` becomes 1.

4. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1. The other variables (`i`, `a`, `d`, `e`, `k`, and `b`) remain unchanged according to the problem statement.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `a` remains the same, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `k` is either `j` or `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, and `j` is 1**
