Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`. The loop runs from `1` to `removals + 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: At the start of the loop, `i` should be set to `1` because the loop starts with the first iteration.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, the condition `1 <= i <= removals + 1` must hold true. This means `i` must be within this range, and `removals` must be a non-negative integer (since it represents the number of elements Alice can remove).

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `removals` is a non-negative integer and that `i` is set to `1` at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `removals` is an integer representing the number of elements Alice can remove.
- `negatives` is an integer representing the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1.
- `elements` is a list of integers.
- `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * n`.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `elements`.
- `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.

We only need to adjust the states related to the loop head, which are `removals` and `i`.

State: **`removals` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is 1**
