Output State: **`removals` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `s` is `s - elements[-1]`**

Explanation: The code subtracts the last element of the list `elements` (i.e., `elements[-1]`) from the variable `s`. Since `i` is 1, it refers to the last element of the list. The value of `removals` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.
