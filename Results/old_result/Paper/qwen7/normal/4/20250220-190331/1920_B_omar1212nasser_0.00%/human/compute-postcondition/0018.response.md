Output State: **`removals` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is 3, `n` is the updated value of `n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-2]` if no `IndexError`, otherwise `n` is 0, `pos` is `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `s - 2 * n` to the list `pos`. Given the initial state, `s` is defined as `s - 2 * n - elements[-2]`. Since `pos` initially contains `[s - 2 * n]`, after appending, `pos` becomes `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]`. The values of `removals`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged unless an `IndexError` occurs during the calculation of `n`, in which case `n` is set to 0.
