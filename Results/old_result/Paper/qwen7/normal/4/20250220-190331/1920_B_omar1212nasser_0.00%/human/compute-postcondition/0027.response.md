Output State: **The program returns the maximum value in the list `pos`, which contains the value `s - 2 * n` repeated `removals` times.**

Explanation:
- The variable `removals` is at least 4.
- `i` is equal to `removals`.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `elements` minus the last `removals` elements.
- `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the sum of the elements from `elements[-(negatives + 1)]` to `elements[-removals]` if no `IndexError` occurred, otherwise `n` is 0.
- `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * n` repeated `removals` times.
- The function returns the maximum value in the list `pos`.
