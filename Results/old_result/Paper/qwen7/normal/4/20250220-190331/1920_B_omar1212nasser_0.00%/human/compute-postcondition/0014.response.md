Output State: **`removals` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is 3, `s` is `s - 2 * n - elements[-2]`, `n` is either the updated value of `n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-2]` if no `IndexError` occurred, or 0 if an `IndexError` occurred, `pos` is `[s - 2 * n]**.

Explanation:
- The code `s -= elements[-i]` subtracts the last element of the `elements` list (at index `-i`) from `s`. Given that `i` is 3, it means we are accessing `elements[-3]`.
- Since `s` was initially defined as `s - elements[-1]`, after executing the code, `s` becomes `s - elements[-1] - elements[-3]` which simplifies to `s - 2 * n - elements[-2]` because `n` is `s - elements[-1]`.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged unless there is an `IndexError` when trying to access `elements[-(negatives + 1)]`. If no error occurs, `n` updates to `n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-2]`.
- The list `pos` remains as `[s - 2 * n]` since no operation changes its value.
