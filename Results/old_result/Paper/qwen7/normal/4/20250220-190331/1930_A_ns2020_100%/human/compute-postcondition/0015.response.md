Output State: **`t` is non-zero, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split and converted to integers**.

Explanation: The code `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `A`. The variable `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
