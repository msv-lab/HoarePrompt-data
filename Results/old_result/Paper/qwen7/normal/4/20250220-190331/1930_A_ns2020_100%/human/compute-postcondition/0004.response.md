Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `A.sort()` sorts the list `A` in ascending order. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The list `A` is updated to be its sorted version.
