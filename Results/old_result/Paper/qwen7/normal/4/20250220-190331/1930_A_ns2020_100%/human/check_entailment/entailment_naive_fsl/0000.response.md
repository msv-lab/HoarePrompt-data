Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by always selecting the smallest two numbers available on the whiteboard. By sorting the list and summing every other element starting from the first, the program ensures that the minimum of the two chosen numbers is always added to the score. This approach guarantees the maximum possible score because it pairs the smallest numbers together, which is optimal for maximizing the sum of the minimums.

Given the problem constraints and the examples provided, the program handles all cases correctly. Sorting the array and summing every other element starting from the first ensures that the score is maximized for any set of 2n positive integers. Therefore, the program is correct.
