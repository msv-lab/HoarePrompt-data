Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of `2n` integers `A`.
3. **Sorting**: The list `A` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. **Scoring Calculation**: The program calculates the score by summing every second element starting from the first element (`A[0] + A[2] + ...`). This approach ensures that the smallest elements are paired together as much as possible, maximizing the minimum value in each pair, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.
5. **Output**: The calculated score is printed for each test case.
6. **Loop Termination**: The loop runs until all test cases are processed, and the variable `t` is eventually set to 0.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly computes the maximum final score for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
