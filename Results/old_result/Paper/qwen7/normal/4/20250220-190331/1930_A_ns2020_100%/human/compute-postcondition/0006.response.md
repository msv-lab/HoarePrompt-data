Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 4999, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code `t = t - 1` decrements the value of `t` by 1. Since `t` was initially an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000`, after decrementing by 1, `t` now ranges from `0` to `4999`. The values of `n` and `A` remain unchanged.
