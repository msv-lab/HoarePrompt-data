Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). This value is not relevant to the print statement execution.
- `n` is an input integer. This value is also not directly relevant to the print statement execution.
- `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. The print statement `print(sum(A[::2]))` will sum every second element in the list `A`.

To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the list `A` and how the slicing operation `A[::2]` works. The slice `A[::2]` selects every second element starting from the first element of the list `A`.

Let's break it down:

1. `A[::2]` means taking every second element starting from the first element.
2. The `sum()` function will add up these selected elements.

Since the exact content of `A` is not specified, we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

Output: **sum of every second element in the list A (where A is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer)**
