Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `b` is equal to `c`, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`, and if `b` is less than `c`, then `b` remains less than `c`, and if `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, then `b` modulo 2 equals `c` modulo 2.**
