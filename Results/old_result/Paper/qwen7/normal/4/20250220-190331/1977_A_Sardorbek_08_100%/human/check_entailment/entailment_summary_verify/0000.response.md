### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description:
- The task is to determine if it is possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move either adds or removes exactly one cube.
- The program should output "Yes" if it is possible and "No" if it is not.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases `a`.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes, respectively.
- The program then checks several conditions:
  - If `b` is equal to `c`, it prints "YES".
  - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints "NO".
  - If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both odd or both even), it prints "Yes".
  - Otherwise, it prints "No".

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes `t` test cases, reading pairs of integers `(b, c)` and printing one of four possible responses: 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No'.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect because it fails to handle the parity condition properly.
- It suggested a corrected version that checks if the difference between `b` and `c` is even.

#### Evaluation:
- Let's verify the logic of the original assessment.
- The original program indeed has issues with handling the parity condition correctly.
- The corrected version provided in the original assessment is correct. It checks if `(b - c) % 2 == 0`, which ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even, allowing the parity to match.

Given the corrected version, the program now correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program, when corrected, is now correct according to the problem description and the function summary.
