Reasoning:

1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` which represent the number of moves and the desired number of cubes respectively.
3. The logic within the loop checks the conditions to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves:
   - If `b` (number of moves) equals `m` (desired cubes), it prints "YES".
   - If `b` is less than `m`, it prints "NO" because there aren't enough moves to add more cubes.
   - If `b` and `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it prints "Yes". This is correct because the parity of the number of moves determines whether we can end up with an even or odd number of cubes.
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

However, there is a minor issue with the conditionals. Specifically, the condition `elif b % 2 == c % 2:` should be `if b % 2 == c % 2:` to ensure that the correct logic is applied for each test case without being overshadowed by previous conditions. 

Given the current implementation, the logic seems to handle the conditions correctly, but the use of `elif` instead of `if` might lead to unexpected behavior if the conditions are not mutually exclusive. However, in this specific problem, the conditions are designed to cover all necessary cases.

Correctness: **True**
