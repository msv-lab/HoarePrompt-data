Output: **YES**

Explanation: According to the initial state, the variable `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, but its specific value is not relevant to the print statement. Similarly, `a`, `i`, `b`, and `c` are defined but their specific values are not needed to determine the output of the print statement. The print statement simply outputs the string 'YES', regardless of the values of the other variables.
