Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`, and `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. After the execution of the if-else block, the current value of `b` modulo 2 will be equal to the current value of `c` modulo 2 if the condition `b % 2 == c % 2` is true. If the condition is false, `b` will still be greater than or equal to `c`.
