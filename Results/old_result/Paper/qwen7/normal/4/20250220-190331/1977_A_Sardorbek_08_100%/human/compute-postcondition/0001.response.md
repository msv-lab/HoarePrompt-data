State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `i` must be 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
- The loop condition `i < a` determines whether the loop will execute.
- For the loop to start executing, `a` must be at least 1 (since `i` starts at 0).
- The value of `t` (which is given as a positive integer between 1 and 100) does not affect the loop's execution condition directly.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `a` is at least 1 and `i` is initialized to 0.
