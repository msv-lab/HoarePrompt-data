Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to `a`. The variable `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). The variable `a` is the input integer that determined the number of iterations. After the loop, `b` and `c` will be the last pair of integers entered by the user during the loop's execution. The variable `q` will be a tuple containing the last values of `b` and `c`. If `b` equals `c`, the output was 'YES'. If `b` is less than `c`, the output was 'NO'. If `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, and `b` modulo 2 equals `c` modulo 2, the output was 'Yes'. Otherwise, the output was 'No'.
