Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i + 1`, `r` is the input from the user, `v2` is `i`**.

Explanation: The code `r = input('')` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r`. The other variables (`kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, and `v2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
