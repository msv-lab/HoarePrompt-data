Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, the user needs to provide a new input to set the range for the next iteration, `prev` retains its previous value.**

In this code, `v1` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `kp`, `n`, `g`, and `prev` remain unchanged from their initial states. The user still needs to provide a new input to set the range for the next iteration.
