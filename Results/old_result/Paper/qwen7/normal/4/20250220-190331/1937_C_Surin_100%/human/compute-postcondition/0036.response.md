Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `i` and `n`. It flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which means any buffered data is immediately written to the terminal or file. However, since no variables are modified or read by this line of code, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 is also still valid.
