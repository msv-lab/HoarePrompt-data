Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1 but its exact value is not specified.
- `r` is an input string with its current value being '='.
- `r` is not equal to '>'.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

Here, `prev` is not defined in the initial state. Since `prev` is not defined and no value for it is provided, we cannot determine its value from the given information. Therefore, we need to leave `prev` as it is in the output.

Given the information, the output will include the value of `i` which is 1, and `prev` will remain as it is because its value is unknown.

Output: **? 1 1 prev prev**
