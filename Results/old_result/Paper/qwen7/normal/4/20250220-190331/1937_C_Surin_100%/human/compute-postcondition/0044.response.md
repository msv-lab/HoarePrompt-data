Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is '=', `r2` is an input string**

The code `r2 = input('')` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `r2`. Since the initial value of `r` was '=', and no changes were made to `n` and `i`, their states remain the same. The value of `r2` is an input string from the user, but its specific value cannot be determined without actual user input.
