Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1, but its exact value is not specified.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Here, `v1` and `prev` are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine their values precisely. Therefore, we will represent them as `v1` and `prev` in the output.

Given the information, the output will include the placeholder values for `v1` and `prev`, along with the explicit value of `i`.

Output: **? v1 1 v1 prev**
