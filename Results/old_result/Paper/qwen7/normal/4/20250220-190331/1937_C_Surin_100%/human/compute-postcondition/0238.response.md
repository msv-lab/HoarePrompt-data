Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head defines the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 2
   - `r` is an input string (this variable is not part of the loop head and thus not adjusted here)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - The condition `n > 2` must still hold true.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 3
- `n` must still be greater than 2

The value of `r` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2**
