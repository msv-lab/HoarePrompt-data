Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `r` is an input string from the user**.

Explanation: The code `r = input()` assigns the value entered by the user (as a string) to the variable `r`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The condition that `n` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
