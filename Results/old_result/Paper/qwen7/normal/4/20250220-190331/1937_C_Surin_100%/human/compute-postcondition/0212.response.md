Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly stated to be 1.
- `n` must be greater than `n-1`, but this doesn't give us a specific value for `n`.
- `r` is an input string and its current value is explicitly stated to be '='.
- `prev` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value from the given information.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

We know:
- `{i}` will be replaced with the value of `i`, which is 1.
- `{prev}` is used twice and its value is unknown since it is not defined in the initial state.

Therefore, the output will include the known value of `i` and placeholders for `prev`.

Output: **? 1 1 prev prev**
