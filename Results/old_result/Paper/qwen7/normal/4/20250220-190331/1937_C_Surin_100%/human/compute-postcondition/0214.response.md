Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than `n-1`, `r` is '=', `r2` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code `r2 = input('')` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r2`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged. The string `r` is still equal to '=', and the condition that `n` must be greater than `n-1` remains valid.
