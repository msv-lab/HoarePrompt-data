Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and interacts with a hidden permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) which is a permutation of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\). The function can make up to \(3n\) queries to compare bitwise OR results and determine the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.**

This means the function needs to find the pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) from the hidden permutation where the bitwise OR of the elements at those indices is the largest possible value. It can do so by asking up to \(3n\) questions to compare different pairs of elements using their bitwise OR operation.
