Output State: **`kp` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i`.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variable values. It only flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all pending output is written to the console. Since no variables are modified, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
