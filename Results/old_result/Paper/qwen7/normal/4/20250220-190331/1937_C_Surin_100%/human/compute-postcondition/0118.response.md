Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - `i` should start from 1 (inclusive).
   - `n` should be greater than 1 (since `range(1, n)` requires `n > 1`).

3. **Consider the given initial states**:
   - `kp` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `r` is the input from the user for the last iteration.
   - `v2` is `i` for the last iteration.
   - `prev` is 0.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `n` is already stated as an input integer greater than 1, no adjustment is needed for `n`.
   - For the loop to start, `i` should be initialized to 1. The value of `i` for the last iteration (`v2`) is irrelevant because the loop starts fresh each time.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 1.
- `n` should be greater than 1 (already given).

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
