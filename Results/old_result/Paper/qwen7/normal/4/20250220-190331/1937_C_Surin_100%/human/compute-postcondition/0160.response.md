Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is described as being greater than 3 but no specific value is provided, so we cannot determine its exact value.
- `r` is an input string but its value is not specified.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

We know that `{i}` will be replaced by the value of `i`, which is 3. However, `{prev}` is not defined in the initial state and there is no context provided about what `prev` might be. Since `prev` is not defined, it will remain as `prev` in the output string.

Therefore, the output will be a string with placeholders for `prev`.

Output: **'? 3 3 prev prev'**
