Output State: **A lambda function `R` is defined that takes input, splits it by spaces, and maps each element to an integer. No variables are assigned any values, and the permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code defines a lambda function `R` which takes input, splits it by spaces, and maps each element to an integer. However, no variables are assigned any values, and the permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) remains unchanged. Therefore, the initial state remains the same after executing the given code.
