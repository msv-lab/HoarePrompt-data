Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n`.

2. **Querying Strategy:**
   - The program uses a strategy to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i âŠ• p_j` is maximized.
   - It starts by comparing pairs of elements using bitwise OR operations and comparing the results.

3. **First Phase:**
   - For each element `i` from `1` to `n-1`, it compares `(p_1 | p_1)` with `(p_i | p_i)`.
   - This is done to find the largest element in terms of the OR operation.

4. **Second Phase:**
   - After finding the largest element (let's call it `v1`), it compares `(v1 | i)` with `(v1 | prev)` for each `i` from `1` to `n-1`.
   - It updates `prev` to the index `i` if `(v1 | i)` is greater than `(v1 | prev)`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - It prints the indices `prev` and `v1` as the result.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Query Strategy:**
   - The first phase of querying is flawed. Comparing `(p_1 | p_1)` with `(p_i | p_i)` does not help in finding the maximum XOR. Instead, we need to compare different pairs to find the maximum XOR.

2. **Lack of Proper Maximization:**
   - The second phase also does not ensure that the maximum XOR is found. It only checks if `(v1 | i)` is greater than `(v1 | prev)`, but this does not guarantee that the maximum XOR is found.

3. **Number of Queries:**
   - The program makes a fixed number of queries without ensuring that the maximum XOR is found within the limit of `3n` queries.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the strategy to find the maximum XOR pair using the allowed queries. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
