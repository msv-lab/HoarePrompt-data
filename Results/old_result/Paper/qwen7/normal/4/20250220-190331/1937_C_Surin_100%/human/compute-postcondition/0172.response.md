Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, the final value of `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `r` is the input value from the last iteration, and `prev` is `n-1`. `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values but ensures that all previously written output buffers are flushed. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as they were before the execution of this line of code.
