Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than `n-1`, `prev` is 1, `r` is '=', the current value of `r2` is '<'**

Explanation: The variable `prev` is assigned the value of `i`, which was initially 1. All other variables retain their initial states. The condition `n` must be greater than `n-1` is still valid, as it is a precondition that does not get altered by the given code.
