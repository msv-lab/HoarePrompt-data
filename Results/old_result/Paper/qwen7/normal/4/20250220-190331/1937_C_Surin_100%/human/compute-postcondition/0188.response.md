Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer which is greater than `n-1`, `v2` is 2**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any previously printed content is displayed immediately. However, this command does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, and `v2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
