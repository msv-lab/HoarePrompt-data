Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is the new input integer which is greater than `n-1`
   - `v2` is 2
   - If `r` equals '<', then `v1` is also 2 (but since there is no else part, `v1` remains 2 regardless of `r`).

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be the new input integer which is greater than `n-1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 3
- `n` is the new input integer which is greater than `n-1`
- `v2` is 2
- `v1` is 2 (since it remains unchanged if `r` is not '<')

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is the new input integer which is greater than `n-1`, `v2` is 2, `v1` is 2**
