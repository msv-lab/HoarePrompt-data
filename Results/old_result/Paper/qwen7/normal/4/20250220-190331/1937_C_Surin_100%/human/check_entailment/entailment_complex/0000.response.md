Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Each query compares the bitwise OR of two pairs of elements from the hidden permutation \(p\).

2. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code uses a lambda function to parse input and reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes some variables and then performs a series of queries.
   - The first part of the loop sets `v1` to 0 and iterates from 1 to \(n-1\). For each iteration, it compares \(p_{v1} \mid p_{v1}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\) for \(i\) ranging from 1 to \(n-1\). This helps in finding the largest index where the bitwise OR is maximized.
   - The second part of the loop further refines the search by comparing \(p_{v1} \mid p_i\) with \(p_{v1} \mid p_{prev}\) and updates `prev` accordingly.
   - Finally, it prints the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize the bitwise XOR operation.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The approach seems logically sound. By comparing bitwise OR values, the algorithm aims to identify the indices that contribute to the maximum XOR value.
   - The code makes sure to flush the output after each query, which is crucial for the interaction protocol.
   - The number of queries is controlled within the limit of \(3n\).
   - The final output is the correct pair of indices that maximize the XOR value.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as per the given constraints and requirements.

Correctness: **True**
