Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is `i`, the user needs to provide a new input to set the range for the next iteration, `prev` retains its previous value.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or affect the state of the variables. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
