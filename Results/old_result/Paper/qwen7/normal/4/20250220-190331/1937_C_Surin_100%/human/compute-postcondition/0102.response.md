Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `kp` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is defined as `i + 1`.
   - `r` is equal to `<`.
   - `v2` is defined as `i`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `v1` is `i + 1`.
- `v2` is `i`.

However, the values of `i` are not explicitly given. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. But we can still describe the print statement in terms of `i`.

The print statement will output the string `'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}'`, where `{v1}` and `{v2}` are replaced with their respective values, which are `i + 1` and `i`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? i+1 i+1 i i'**
