Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2, but its exact value is not specified.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Here, `i` is clearly 2. However, the values of `v1` and `prev` are not provided in the initial state. Since these values are not defined or given, they cannot be determined precisely from the information provided.

Given this, the most precise description we can provide is that `v1` and `prev` are placeholders for undefined values.

Output: **'? [v1] 2 [v1] [prev]'**
