Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is `i`.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It only flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which means it ensures that all previously written output is actually sent to the user or file. Since no variables are modified or their values changed by this line of code, the initial state remains unchanged.
