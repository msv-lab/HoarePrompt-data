Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `r` is the input value from the user
   - `prev` is 2

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`. Given that `i` is now 3, `n` must still be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 3.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
