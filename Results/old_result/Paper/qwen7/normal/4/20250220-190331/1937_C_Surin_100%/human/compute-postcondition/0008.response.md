Based on the initial state provided:

- `kp` is 0
- `n` must be at least 2
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is 0
- `v2` is `i`

The `print` statement is:

```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Here's the breakdown of what will be printed:

- `{v1}` is replaced with the value of `v1`, which is 0.
- `{v1}` again is replaced with the value of `v1`, which is still 0.
- `{v2}` is replaced with the value of `v2`, which is `i`.
- `{v2}` again is replaced with the value of `v2`, which is `i`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? 0 0 i i**
