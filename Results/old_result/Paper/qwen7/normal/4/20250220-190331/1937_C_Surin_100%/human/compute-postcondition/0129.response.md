Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is an input string and its current value is '='**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change the values of any variables. It only flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which is an operation related to how data is handled when printing to the console. Since no variables are assigned new values or affected by this command, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
