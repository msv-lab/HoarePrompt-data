Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` must be greater than `n-1`. Since `n-1` would be 0 (as `i` is 1), `n` must be greater than 0. However, no specific value for `n` is given other than it must satisfy this condition.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

- `v1` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value.
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `prev` is also not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value.

Since `v1` and `prev` are undefined, we can only describe the known part of the print statement.

Output: **? [v1] 1 [v1] [prev]**
