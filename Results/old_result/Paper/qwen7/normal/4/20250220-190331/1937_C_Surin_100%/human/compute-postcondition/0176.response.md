Output State: **`g` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is the new input integer which is greater than `n-1`, `r` is the input value from the last iteration, `prev` is `n-1`, `v1` is 0.**

The code assigns the value 0 to `v1`. Since `g`, `i`, `n`, `r`, and `prev` are not affected by this assignment, their values remain unchanged.
