Output State: **`r` is either 1 or 0, `A` is an integer, `g` is a dictionary representing the tree where keys are vertex IDs and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n - 1, `stack` is a list containing no elements, `visited` is a set containing the element 1, `d` is a dictionary with key (1) and value either 1 or 2, `x` is 1, `p` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `visited.remove(x)` removes the value of `x` from the `visited` set. Given that `x` is 1, the `visited` set, which was initially empty, now contains the element 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
