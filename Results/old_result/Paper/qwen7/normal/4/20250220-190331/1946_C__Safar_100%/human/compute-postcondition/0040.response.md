The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `edges`. `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b. The function returns information based on the specified operations involving the tree structure defined by `n` and `edges`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `edges`. It returns information based on removing `k` edges from a tree with `n` vertices, where each edge is represented in `edges` as a tuple (a, b).**
