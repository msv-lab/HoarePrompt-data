Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `r` is 0, `A` is an integer, `g` is a dictionary representing the tree where keys are vertex IDs and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n - 1, `stack` is a list containing one tuple (1, 1), `visited` is a set including `x` and `x`, `d` is a dictionary with key (1) and value 1, `p` is 1, `d[x]` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for node in g[x]:
    if node != p:
        stack.append((node, x))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `node` is not equal to `p`; if `node` is not equal to `p`, then `stack` contains the tuple (`node`, `x`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `node` is a node in `g[x]` that is not equal to `p`, and `stack` contains the tuple (`node`, `x`). After executing the if statement, `stack` has appended the tuple (`node`, `x`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `stack` contains the tuples from the previous iteration plus the new tuple (`node`, `x`). Since the if condition checks if `node` is not equal to `p`, if the condition is true, the new tuple is added as is. If the condition is false, no action is taken and the stack remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
