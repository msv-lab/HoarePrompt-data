Output State: **`r` is 1, `A` is an integer, `g` is a dictionary representing the tree where keys are vertex IDs and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n - 1, `stack` is a list containing one tuple (1, 1), `visited` is an empty set, `d` is a dictionary with key (1) and value 1, `x` is 1, `p` is 1.**

The value of `r` is incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
