Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, modifying an array to maximize and minimize its sum respectively, under certain constraints.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`), the number of elements Alice can remove (`k`), the number of elements Bob can negate (`x`), and the array elements.
   - Sorts the array in ascending order.
   - Calls `func_2` with the sorted array to get the optimal sum after the game.
   - Prints the result for each test case.
3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Takes the maximum number of elements Alice can remove (`removals`), the maximum number of elements Bob can negate (`negatives`), and the array elements (`elements`).
   - Calculates several sums and iteratively updates the possible sums after different combinations of removals and negations.
   - Returns the maximum possible sum after the game.

Given the descriptions and the logic implemented in both functions, they correctly implement the strategy for Alice and Bob to achieve their respective goals. The sorting step ensures that the smallest elements are removed first, and the calculations in `func_2` account for all possible combinations of removals and negations to find the optimal sum.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
