Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, followed by the array `a`.
   - Sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
   - Calls `func_2(k, x, a)` to compute the optimal sum of the array after the game.
   - Prints the result for each test case.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Computes the sum of the entire array `s`.
   - Initializes a list `pos` to store possible sums after different removals and negations.
   - Iterates up to `removals` to calculate possible sums by removing elements and negating some elements.
   - Updates `s` and `s2` (sum of the last `negatives + i` elements) in each iteration.
   - Appends the calculated sum `s - 2 * s2` to the list `pos`.
   - Returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

Given the logic:
- Sorting the array allows Alice to remove the smallest elements first, maximizing the remaining sum.
- Bob's strategy involves negating the largest elements to minimize the sum.
- The function correctly considers all possible combinations of removals and negations within the constraints.

Both functions together ensure that the game's rules are followed and the optimal sum is calculated.

Correctness: **True**
