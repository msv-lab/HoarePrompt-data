Output State: **`i` is 2, `removals` is a positive integer, `s2` is updated to `s2` plus the second last element of `elements`, the sum of `negatives` and `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `pos` is a list with one element which is `s - 2 * s2`**.

Explanation: The code updates `s2` by adding the second last element of `elements` to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
