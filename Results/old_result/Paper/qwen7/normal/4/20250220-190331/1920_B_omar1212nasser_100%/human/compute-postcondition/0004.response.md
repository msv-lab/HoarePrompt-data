Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` is less than or equal to `removals`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `[1, removals]`.

4. **Adjust the states**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing, which means `i` should be 1 initially and `removals` should be a positive integer.

Given the initial state:
- `pos` is a list containing one element which is `s - 2 * s2`.
- `removals` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove.
- `negatives` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1.
- `elements` is a list of integers representing the array elements.
- `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.

Since the loop only depends on `i` and `removals`, we need to ensure that `i` is 1 and `removals` is a positive integer.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`i` is 1, `removals` must be a positive integer**
