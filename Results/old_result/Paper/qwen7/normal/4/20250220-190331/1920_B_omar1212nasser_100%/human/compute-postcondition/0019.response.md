Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `removals`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `removals + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `removals` is a positive integer
   - `s2` is updated to `s2` plus the second last element of `elements`
   - The sum of `negatives` and `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`
   - `pos` is a list with one element which is `s - 2 * s2`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, making `i` equal to 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which is now 3) must still be less than `removals + 1`. Therefore, `removals` must be at least 3.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` will be 3.
- `removals` must be at least 3.

The other variables (`removals`, `s2`, `negatives`, `elements`, `pos`, and `s`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `removals` must be at least 3, `s2` is updated to `s2` plus the second last element of `elements`, the sum of `negatives` and `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, and `pos` is a list with one element which is `s - 2 * s2`**.
