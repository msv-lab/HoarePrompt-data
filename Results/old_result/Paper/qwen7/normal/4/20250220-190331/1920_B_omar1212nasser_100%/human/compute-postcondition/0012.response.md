Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `removals`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `removals`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `removals` is a positive integer
   - `s2` is updated to `s2` plus the second last element of `elements`
   - The sum of `negatives` and `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`
   - `pos` is a list with one element which is `s - 2 * s2`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will be 3.
   - The value of `removals` remains unchanged because the loop condition depends on `i` being less than or equal to `removals`.

5. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` is now 3
   - `removals` is still a positive integer (unchanged)
   - `s2` remains updated to `s2` plus the second last element of `elements`
   - The sum of `negatives` and `i` is still less than or equal to the length of `elements`
   - `pos` remains a list with one element which is `s - 2 * s2`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 3, `removals` is a positive integer, `s2` is updated to `s2` plus the second last element of `elements`, the sum of `negatives` and `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `pos` is a list with one element which is `s - 2 * s2`**
