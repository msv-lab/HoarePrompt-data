### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program and the function summaries to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis

1. **Initialization and Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - The function initializes `pos` to store potential sums.
   - It calculates the initial sum `s` of the array.
   - It appends the sum after removing the last `x` elements (since Bob will negate these).

2. **Iterative Calculation:**
   - The function iterates from 1 to `removals` (inclusive) to consider different removal scenarios.
   - For each iteration, it updates the sum `s` by removing the largest remaining element.
   - It updates `s2` (sum of the last `x` elements) by removing the largest remaining element.
   - If there are enough remaining elements to negate, it adds back the negated value.
   - It appends the new calculated sum to `pos`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles edge cases where `k` or `x` is equal to `n` (all elements can be removed or negated).
   - The function correctly handles scenarios where fewer than `x` elements need to be negated.

#### Main Function `func_1` Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Sorting:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` and the array `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a`.

2. **Calling `func_2`:**
   - The function calls `func_2` with parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted array `a`.
   - It prints the result returned by `func_2`.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Sorting and Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - Sorting the array helps in easily considering the smallest and largest elements.
   - The initial sum calculation is correct.

2. **Handling Removals and Negations:**
   - The logic for calculating the sum after removing elements and negating elements is sound.
   - The nested loop correctly considers all combinations of removals and negations within the constraints.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like when `k` or `x` is equal to `n` (all elements can be removed or negated).
   - The program correctly handles scenarios where fewer than `x` elements need to be negated.

### Conclusion

After re-analyzing the program and the function summaries, it appears that the logic implemented in `func_2` correctly computes the optimal sum for the given constraints. The main function `func_1` correctly processes each test case and calls `func_2` appropriately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
