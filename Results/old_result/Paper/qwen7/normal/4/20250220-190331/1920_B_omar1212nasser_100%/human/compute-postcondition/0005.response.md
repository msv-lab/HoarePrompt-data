Output State: **`i` is 1; `removals` must be a positive integer; `s` is `s` minus the last element of `elements`.**

Explanation: The code `s -= elements[-i]` subtracts the last element of the list `elements` (since `i` is 1, `elements[-i]` refers to `elements[-1]`) from the variable `s`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `removals` is still required to be a positive integer.
