Output State: **`pos` is an empty list, `removals` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and `elements` is a list of integers representing the array elements; `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements`.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the value of the sum of all elements in the list `elements`. The other variables (`pos`, `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
