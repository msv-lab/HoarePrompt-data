Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

    -5
    -9
    0
    -1
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

# Annotated Program:
func_1()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and x are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        
        print(product)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be equal to the total number of test cases, `i` is `t-1`, `k` is the last input integer among all test cases, `x` is the corresponding last input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order for the last test case, `product` is the result of `func_2(k, x, a)`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will hold the exact count of test cases, `i` will be `t-1` since the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`, and for the last test case, `k` and `x` will be the integers obtained from the last input, `a` will be the sorted list of integers for that last test case, and `product` will be the result of applying the function `func_2(k, x, a)` to that list.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: removals is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, negatives is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and elements is a list of integers representing the array elements.
def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:]))
    s2 = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        
        s2 -= elements[-i]
        
        if negatives + i <= len(elements):
            s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * s2)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute `removals` times. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `removals`, `s2` will be updated to include the sum of the last `negatives + removals` elements of `elements`, provided `negatives + removals` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`. The list `pos` will contain `removals` elements, each calculated as `s - 2 * s2`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the original value of `removals`. The variable `s2` will be the sum of the last `negatives + removals` elements of the `elements` list. The list `pos` will contain `removals` elements, each computed as `s - 2 * s2`.
    return max(pos)
    #The program returns the maximum value among `removals` elements in the list `pos`, where each element is calculated as `s - 2 * s2`, and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives + removals` elements of the `elements` list.
