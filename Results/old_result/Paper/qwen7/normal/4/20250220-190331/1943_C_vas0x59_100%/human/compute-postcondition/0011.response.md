Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `u` is the first integer input decreased by 2, `v` is the second integer input decreased by 2, `u2vs[v]` is a list containing the value of `u-1`, `v` is decreased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `v -= 1` decreases the value of `v` by 1. Initially, `v` was the second integer input decreased by 1. After executing the code, `v` is now the second integer input decreased by 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
