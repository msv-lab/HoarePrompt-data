Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10³, and a list `u2vs` of length `n` where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree. The function also processes `n-1` lines describing the edges of the tree. After executing the function body, it returns None.**
