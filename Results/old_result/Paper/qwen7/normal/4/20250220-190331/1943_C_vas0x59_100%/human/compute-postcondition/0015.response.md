Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `u` is the first integer input decreased by 2, `v` is the second integer input decreased by 2, `u` and `v` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code takes two integer inputs, splits them, and converts them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. These values are then assigned to `u` and `v`. The conditions and initial values of `n`, `u`, and `v` are updated accordingly.
