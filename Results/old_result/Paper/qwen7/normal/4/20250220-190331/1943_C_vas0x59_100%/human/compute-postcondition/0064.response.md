Output State: **`path_ba` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `ops` is a list containing tuples `((c1, 1), (c2, 2))**.

Explanation: The initial state includes `path_ba` having at least 3 elements, `i` being 2, and `ops` being a list containing one tuple `(c1, 1)`. The code snippet `ops.append((c2, i))` appends another tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Since `i` is 2, the new tuple added is `(c2, 2)`. Therefore, the updated list `ops` contains two tuples: `(c1, 1)` and `(c2, 2)`.
