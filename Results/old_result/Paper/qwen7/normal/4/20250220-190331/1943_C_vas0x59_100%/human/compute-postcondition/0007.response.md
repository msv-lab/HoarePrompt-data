Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by 1, `v` is an integer from the input decreased by 1, `u2vs[v]` is a list that now contains `u` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `u` to the list `u2vs[v]`. Since `u2vs[v]` was initially a list containing `v`, after appending `u`, the list `u2vs[v]` now contains both `v` and `u`.
