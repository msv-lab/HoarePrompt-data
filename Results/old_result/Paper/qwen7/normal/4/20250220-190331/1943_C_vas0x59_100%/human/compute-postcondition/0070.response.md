Output State: **`path_ba` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 6, `len(path_ba) - ci1` must be greater than 6, `ops` now contains the tuples `(c1, 6)`, `(c2, 4)`, `(c2, 6)`**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 6, the new tuple added to `ops` is `(c2, 6)`. The values of `path_ba`, `i`, `len(path_ba) - ci1`, and the existing tuples in `ops` remain unchanged.
