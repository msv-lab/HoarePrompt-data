Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `len(path_ba) - ci1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is within the range defined by `1` to `len(path_ba) - ci1` with a step of `2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `path_ba` must have at least 3 elements.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `ops` is a list containing tuples `((c1, 1), (c2, 2))`.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2 and the loop increments `i` by 2 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `2 + 2 = 4`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if `1 <= i < len(path_ba) - ci1`.
   - Given `i` is now 4, the condition becomes `1 <= 4 < len(path_ba) - ci1`.

6. **Determine the requirement for `len(path_ba) - ci1`**:
   - For the loop to continue, `len(path_ba) - ci1` must be greater than 4.

7. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `len(path_ba) - ci1` must be greater than 4.

8. **Final state**:
   - `path_ba` must have at least 3 elements (unchanged from the previous state).
   - `i` is 4.
   - `len(path_ba) - ci1` must be greater than 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`path_ba` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 4, `len(path_ba) - ci1` must be greater than 4**
