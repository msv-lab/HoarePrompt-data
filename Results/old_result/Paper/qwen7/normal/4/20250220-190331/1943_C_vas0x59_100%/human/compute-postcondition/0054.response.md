Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `ops` now contains an additional tuple `(c, ci + 1)`.
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(ci + 1):`.

### Understanding the Loop Head
- The loop variable `i` ranges from `0` to `ci`.
- The loop condition for the next iteration is `i < ci + 1`.

### Analyzing the Given Information
- After the previous iteration, `ops` contains an additional tuple `(c, ci + 1)`.
- This means that `ci` has been incremented by 1 since the last iteration.

### Adjusting the States
- The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `ci`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `ci + 1`.

Since `ci` has been incremented by 1, the new value of `ci` is `ci + 1`.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- `ops` will contain an additional tuple `(c, (ci + 1) + 1) = (c, ci + 2)` after the next iteration.
- However, for the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `ci + 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `ci`.

### Final Answer
State: **`ops` now contains an additional tuple `(c, ci + 1)`, `ci` is `ci + 1`**.

To be precise, the state should be:
State: **`ops` now contains an additional tuple `(c, ci + 1)`, `ci` is `ci + 1`**.
