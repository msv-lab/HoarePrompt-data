Output State: **`ops` now contains an additional tuple `(c, ci + 1)`, `ci` is `ci + 1`**

Explanation: The code `ops.append((c, i))` appends a new tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Before the code execution, `ops` already contained an additional tuple `(c, ci + 1)`, and `ci` was equal to `ci + 1`. After executing the code, `ops` will contain one more tuple `(c, ci + 1)`, and `ci` will be incremented by 1.
