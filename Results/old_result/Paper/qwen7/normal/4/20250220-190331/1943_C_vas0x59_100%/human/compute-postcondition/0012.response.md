Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `u` is the first integer input decreased by 2, `v` is the second integer input decreased by 2, `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends `v` to the list `u2vs[u]`**.

Explanation: The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list located at index `u` in the dictionary `u2vs`. Since `u` and `v` are defined as the first and second integer inputs respectively, decreased by 2, the list `u2vs[u]` now contains the value of `v` appended to it. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
