Output State: The set `ans` contains the integer `x`, `q` is `x`, and `temp` is a set containing `(x + r) % n`, `(x - r) % n`, `(x + r) % n`, `((x + r) % n + r) % n`, and `(((x + r) % n + r) % n - r) % n`.

In Natural Language: After all the iterations of the loop, the set `ans` still contains the integer `x`, and `q` remains `x`. The set `temp` contains the following elements: `(x + r) % n`, `(x - r) % n`, `(x + r) % n` (repeated), `((x + r) % n + r) % n`, and `(((x + r) % n + r) % n - r) % n`. This means that `temp` includes the results of adding and subtracting `r` from the elements in `ans`, and these operations are performed based on the conditions specified in the loop.
