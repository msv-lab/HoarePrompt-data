Output State: **`ans` is a set that includes a total of \(2 \times \text{number of elements in } temp - 1\) elements, which consist of multiple occurrences of \((q + r) \% n\), one occurrence of \((q - r) \% n\), `q` is the last element in the set `ans`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and its current value is either '1' or '?', `r` is assigned the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is assigned the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, `r` is converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `r = int(r)` converts the string value of `r` to an integer. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
