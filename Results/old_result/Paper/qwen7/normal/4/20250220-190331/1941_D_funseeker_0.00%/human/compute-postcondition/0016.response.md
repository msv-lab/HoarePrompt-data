Postcondition: `ans` is a set containing the integer `x`, `q` is `x`, and `temp` is a set containing `(x + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, regardless of whether `c` is '1' or '?'.

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, the set `ans` will always contain the integer `x`, `q` will always be equal to `x`, and `temp` will always contain both `(x + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, irrespective of the value of `c` being '1' or '?'.
