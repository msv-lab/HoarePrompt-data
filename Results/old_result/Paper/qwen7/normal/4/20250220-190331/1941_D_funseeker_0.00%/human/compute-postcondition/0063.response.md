Output State: **`ans` is a set that includes a total of \(2 \times \text{number of elements in } temp - 1\) elements, which consist of multiple occurrences of \((q + r) \% n\), one occurrence of \((q - r) \% n\), `q` is the last element in the set `ans`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and its current value is either '1' or '?'.**

Explanation: The line `ans = temp` assigns the value of `temp` to `ans`. This means that `ans` now contains exactly the same elements as `temp`. Since `temp` includes a total of \(2 \times \text{number of elements in } ans - 1\) elements, which consist of multiple occurrences of \((q + r) \% n\), one occurrence of \((q - r) \% n\), `q` is the last element in the set `ans`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and its current value is either '1' or '?', these conditions remain true for `ans` as well.
