### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to verify its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()`: Calls `func_1()` and returns an integer.
   - `func_3()`: Calls `func_1()` and splits the result into a list of integers.
   - `func_4()`: Implements the main logic of the program.

2. **Main Logic in `func_4()`**:
   - The function initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`.
   - It iterates `m` times, reading each throw's distance `r` and direction `c`.
   - For each throw, it updates the set `temp` with possible new positions based on the direction `c` being '0', '1', or '?'.
   - After processing all throws, it adjusts the set `ans` by adding `n` if `0` is present.
   - Finally, it prints the size of the set `ans` and the elements of `ans`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The logic correctly handles both clockwise and counterclockwise throws.
   - The use of sets ensures that only unique positions are considered.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the ball could be at position `0` by adjusting to position `n`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the ball could be at position `0` by adding `n` to the set.
   - The program correctly processes the input format and constraints.
   - The use of modulo `n` ensures that positions wrap around correctly.

5. **Annotations and State Analysis**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The final state of `ans` contains all possible positions of the ball after `m` throws.
   - The adjustments for position `0` and adding `n` are correctly handled.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all possible cases and edge conditions as required.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided annotations.
