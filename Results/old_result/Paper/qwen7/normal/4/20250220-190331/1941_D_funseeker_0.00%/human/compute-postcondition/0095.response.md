Output State: **The set `ans` will contain a total of \(2 \times \text{number of elements in } temp - 1\) elements, with the last element being either \((q + r) \% n\) or \((q - r) \% n\) depending on the value of `c`. The set `temp` will contain all unique elements generated during the loop's execution, specifically \((q + r) \% n\) and \((q - r) \% n\) if `c` is '1' or '?', and no additional elements beyond those already present in `ans` if `c` is neither '1' nor '?'.**

Explanation:
- The line `ans = temp` simply assigns the current state of `temp` to `ans`. This means that `ans` now contains the same elements as `temp`.
- The size of `ans` remains the same as before the assignment, which is \(2 \times \text{number of elements in } temp - 1\).
- The last element of `ans` (and `temp`) is either \((q + r) \% n\) or \((q - r) \% n\) depending on the value of `c`.
- The set `temp` now contains the same elements as `ans`, and its structure remains the same as described in the initial state.
