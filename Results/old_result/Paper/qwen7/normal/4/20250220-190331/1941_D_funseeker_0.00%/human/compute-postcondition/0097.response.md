Output State: The set `ans` will contain a total of \(2^m - 1\) elements after the loop executes all its iterations. These elements will be a combination of all unique results generated from the operations \((q + r) \% n\) and \((q - r) \% n\) for each iteration, starting with the initial set containing `x`. Each element in `ans` will be derived from the initial `x` through a series of additions and subtractions modulo `n`, based on the values of `r` and `c` obtained from `func_1().split()` in each iteration. The final state of `ans` will include all possible combinations of these operations, reflecting the complete execution of the loop for `m` iterations.
