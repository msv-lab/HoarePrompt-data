Output State: The set `ans` will contain a total of \(2 \times \text{number of elements in } temp - 1\) elements, which will consist of multiple occurrences of \((q + r) \% n\). The last element in the set `ans` will be \((q + r) \% n\). The set `temp` will either contain two elements: \((q + r) \% n\) and \((q - r) \% n\), or it will remain empty, depending on the value of `c`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` will contain both \((q + r) \% n\) and \((q - r) \% n\). If `c` is neither '1' nor '?', `temp` will remain empty.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the `ans` set will grow according to the rules defined within the loop, and the `temp` set will reflect the conditions under which new elements were added based on the value of `c`.
