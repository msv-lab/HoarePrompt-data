Output State: **`ans` is a set that must contain at least one element (which now includes (q + r) % n), `q` is `x`, `temp` is a set that must have at least one element (now including (q + r) % n), `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split(), and the current value of `c` is either '0' or '?'**.

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `q` is `x` and `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, the updated value of `temp` now includes `(x + r) % n`. The other variables remain unchanged, and their conditions are still valid.
