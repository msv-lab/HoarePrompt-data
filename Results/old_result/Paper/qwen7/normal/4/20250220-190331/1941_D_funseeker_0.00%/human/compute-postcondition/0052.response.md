Output State: **`ans` is a set that must contain at least one element (now including `(q + r) % n`), `temp` is a set that now includes five elements: `(q + r) % n`, `(q - r) % n`, and three instances of `(q + r) % n`, `q` is the next element in the set `ans`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, and its current value is either '1' or '?'**

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the element `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Initially, `temp` contains four elements: `(q + r) % n`, `(q - r) % n`, and two instances of `(q + r) % n`. After executing the code, `temp` will have one additional element, making it a set with five elements: `(q + r) % n`, `(q - r) % n`, and three instances of `(q + r) % n`. The values of `ans`, `q`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged.
