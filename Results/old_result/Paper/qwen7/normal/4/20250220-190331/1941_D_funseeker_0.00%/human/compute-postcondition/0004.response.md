Output State: **`ans` is a set containing the integer `x`, `r` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `r` to an integer, `c` remains the same string obtained from splitting the return value of `func_1()`**.

Explanation: The code `r = int(r)` converts the string `r` to an integer and assigns it back to `r`. The value of `c` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The set `ans` still contains the integer `x` and the string `c`, but now `r` is an integer.
