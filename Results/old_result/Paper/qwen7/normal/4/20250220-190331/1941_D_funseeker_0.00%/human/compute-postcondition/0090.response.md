Output State: **`ans` contains at least one element, and the last element in the set `ans` is `(q + r) % n`; `temp` contains two elements: `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code adds `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `ans` already contains at least one element, which is `(q + r) % n`, and `temp` contains `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?', the addition of `(q - r) % n` to `temp` does not affect the condition that `ans` contains `(q + r) % n`. The set `temp` now includes both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.
