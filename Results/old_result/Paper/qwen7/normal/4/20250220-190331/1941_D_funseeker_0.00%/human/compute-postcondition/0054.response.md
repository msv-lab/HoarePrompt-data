Postcondition: `ans` is a set that must contain at least one element (now including `(q + r) % n`), `temp` is a set that now includes five elements: `(q + r) % n`, `(q - r) % n`, and three instances of `(q + r) % n`, `q` is the next element in the set `ans`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, and its current value is either '1' or '?'.
