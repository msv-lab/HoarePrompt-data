Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
