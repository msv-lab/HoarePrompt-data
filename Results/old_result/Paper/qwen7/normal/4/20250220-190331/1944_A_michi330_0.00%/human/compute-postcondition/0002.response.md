Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `n` and `k`. The initial state of `t` being at least 1 is preserved, but `t` itself is not directly involved in the operation. Therefore, `t` remains unchanged, while `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the input integers.
