Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, `num` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether `c` equals `r` or not**

Explanation: The variable `num` is incremented by 1. Since `num` was initially either 1 or 2 (depending on whether `c` equals `r`), after executing `num += 1`, `num` will now be either 2 or 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
