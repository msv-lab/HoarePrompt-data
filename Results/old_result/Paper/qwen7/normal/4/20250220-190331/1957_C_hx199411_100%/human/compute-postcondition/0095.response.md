Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `m + 1`, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, `num` is the total sum calculated based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`, and either `m` is 0, in which case `dp` is a list of length 1 filled with 1, or `m` is not 0, in which case `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` filled with 0s, with `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`, and `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7)` for `i` from 3 to `m + 1`.**
