Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `c` is the first integer input split into an integer, `r` is the second integer input split into an integer, `num` is `num + 4`, and `i` is `i + 4**.

Explanation: The code `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Since `num` was initially either `num + 1` or `num + 2`, adding 2 to it results in `num` becoming `num + 3` or `num + 5`. However, since the exact initial value of `num` is not specified beyond being either `num + 1` or `num + 2`, the most accurate representation is to say `num` is now `num + 4`. Similarly, `i` is incremented by 2, making it `i + 4`. The values of `k`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
