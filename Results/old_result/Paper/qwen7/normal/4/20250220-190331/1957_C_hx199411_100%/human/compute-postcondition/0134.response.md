Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(3, m + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - From the given state, `i` is currently `-1`.
   - `m` is defined as `n - num`. Given `num` is `0`, `m` is `n - 0 = n`.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop starts from `3` and goes up to `m + 1`. Therefore, `i` must start from `3` or higher.
   - Since `i` is initially `-1`, it needs to be adjusted to start from `3`.
   - `m` should be at least `3` for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is `3` (or higher) when the loop starts.
   - We also need to ensure that `m` is at least `3` for the loop to execute.

Given these conditions, let's formulate the final state:

**State: **`t` is `initial t - 2 * k`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is 0, `num` is 0, `i` is 3, `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list containing elements 0, 1, and the third element dp[2] is 3**
