Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `c` is the first integer input split into an integer, `r` is the second integer input split into an integer, `num` is `num + 2`, and `i` is `i + 4`**.

Explanation: The code `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Since `num` was previously either `num + 1` or `num + 2`, it now becomes either `(num + 1) + 1` or `(num + 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `num + 2`. Similarly, `i` was previously `i + 2`, and the code does not affect it, so it becomes `i + 2 + 2`, which simplifies to `i + 4`. The values of `k`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged.
