Output State: **`i` is the final value of `k`, `k` remains the same as its initial value, `c` and `r` are the inputs from the last iteration, `num` is `2 * k` if `c` was not equal to `r` in any of the iterations, or `k` if `c` was equal to `r` in all iterations, and `m` is `n - num`.**

This means that after executing the line `m = n - num`, the value of `m` is calculated as `n` minus the current value of `num`. All other variables retain their respective states as described in the initial conditions.
