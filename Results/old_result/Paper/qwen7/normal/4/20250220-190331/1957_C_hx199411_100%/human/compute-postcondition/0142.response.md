Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is `initial t - 2 * k`, but since `k` is 0, `t` remains `initial t`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `num` is 0.
   - `i` is 6.
   - `m` is at least 5.
   - `dp` is a list containing elements 0, 1, 5, 14, and the sixth element `dp[5]` is 41.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop starts with `i` set to 3 and continues until `i` reaches `m + 1`. Given that `m` is at least 3, the loop will continue until `i` is 6.
   - For each iteration, the value of `dp[i]` is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

3. **Loop Iterations:**
   - When `i` is 3:
     \[
     dp[3] = (dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) \% (10 ** 9 + 7) = (5 + 2 * 1 * 2) \% (10 ** 9 + 7) = 9
     \]
   - When `i` is 4:
     \[
     dp[4] = (dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) \% (10 ** 9 + 7) = (9 + 3 * 5 * 2) \% (10 ** 9 + 7) = (9 + 30) \% (10 ** 9 + 7) = 39
     \]
   - When `i` is 5:
     \[
     dp[5] = (dp[4] + (5 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) \% (10 ** 9 + 7) = (39 + 4 * 9 * 2) \% (10 ** 9 + 7) = (39 + 72) \% (10 ** 9 + 7) = 111
     \]

4. **Final State:**
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be 6, and `dp` will contain the values [0, 1, 5, 14, 41, 111].

5. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet `print(dp[m])` will print the value of `dp[m]`.
   - Since `m` is at least 5, the value printed will be `dp[5]`, which is 111.

Output: **111**
