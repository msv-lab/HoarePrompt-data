Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between 1 and 10^4 exclusive.**

Explanation: The initial state of `t` is a non-zero integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. After executing `t -= 1`, `t` is decremented by 1. Since `t` was originally between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, decrementing it by 1 means `t` is now between 1 and 10^4 exclusive.
