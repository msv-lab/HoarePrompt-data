You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    3
    
    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6
    
    1000 4
    
    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        num = 0
        for i in range(k):
            (c, r) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        m = n - num
        if m == 0:
            print(1)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [0 for i in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers t, n, and k, followed by k pairs of integers (r_i, c_i). It calculates the number of moves where the row index equals the column index (num) and computes m as n - num. Based on the value of m, it either prints 1 or constructs and prints a dynamic programming array dp to compute a specific value modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`.
   - It also reads the coordinates `(r, c)` for each of the `k` moves.

2. **Counting Valid Moves:**
   - The program counts the number of moves where `c != r`. These are the moves where the computer can mirror the move.
   - If `c == r`, the computer cannot mirror the move, so it increments `num` by 1. Otherwise, it increments `num` by 2.

3. **Calculating Remaining Valid Positions:**
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `n - num`. This represents the number of positions left on the board where a rook can be placed without attacking any existing rooks.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Counting Configurations:**
   - If `m` is 0 or 1, the program directly prints 1 because there is only one way to place the rooks.
   - Otherwise, it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining `m` positions.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized to store the number of configurations for `m` positions.
   - The base cases are set: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - For `m >= 3`, the recurrence relation used is:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This recurrence relation correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions, considering the constraints of the problem.

5. **Output the Result:**
   - Finally, the program prints the value of `dp[m]`.

### Verification of Correctness:

- The logic for counting the number of valid moves (`num`) is correct.
- The calculation of `m` as `n - num` is correct.
- The use of dynamic programming to count the number of configurations is correct and follows the problem constraints.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required range.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
