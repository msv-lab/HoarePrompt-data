Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the integer `k`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state; it will start from 0.
   - `k` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, it does not need adjustment.
   - `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 2` (this is not relevant to the loop execution).
- `n` is an input integer (not relevant to the loop execution).
- `k` is an input integer.
- `num` is 0 (not relevant to the loop execution).

The only state that needs adjustment is `k` to ensure the loop can execute.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:
**`k` must be greater than 0**.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`k` must be greater than 0**
