Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 2, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `c` and `r`. The initial values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 2, and `k` must still be greater than 2. The values of `c` and `r` are the integers entered by the user.
