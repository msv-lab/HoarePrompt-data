Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, `num` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `c` equals `r` or not**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `c` and `r`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, `r`, and `num` are updated based on the new inputs, but the conditions and relationships between the variables remain as described in the initial state.
