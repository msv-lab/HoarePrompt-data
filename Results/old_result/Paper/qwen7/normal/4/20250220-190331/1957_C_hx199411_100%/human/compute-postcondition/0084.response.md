Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `k-1`, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, `num` is the total sum calculated based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` filled with 0s, `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`.**

Explanation: The code `dp[2] = 3` updates the value of `dp[2]` to 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
