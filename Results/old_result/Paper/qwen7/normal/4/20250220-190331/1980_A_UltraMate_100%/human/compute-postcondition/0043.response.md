Output State: **`i` is 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `ans` is 0, `s` is an input string, `hmp` is a Counter object containing the count of each character in `s`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**.

The code `hmp = Counter(s)` creates a Counter object named `hmp` that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
