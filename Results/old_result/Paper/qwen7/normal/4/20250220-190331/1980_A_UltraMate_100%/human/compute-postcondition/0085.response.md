Postcondition: `i` is 'G', `p` must contain at least one character, `ans` is `m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `hmp` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of each character in `s`. If the character `i` ('G') is not in the Counter object `hmp`, the postcondition remains as described in the if part.
