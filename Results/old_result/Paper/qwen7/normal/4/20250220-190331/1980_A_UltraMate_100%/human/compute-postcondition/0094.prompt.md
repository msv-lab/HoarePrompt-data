Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `hmp` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of each character in `s`
Code of the loop:
for i in p:
    if i not in hmp:
        ans += m


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 'G', `p` must contain at least one character, `ans` is `m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `hmp` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of each character in `s`. If the character `i` ('G') is not in the Counter object `hmp`, the postcondition remains as described in the if part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the next character in `p`, `p` is the string `p` without the first character, `ans` is `2 * m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `hmp` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of each character in `s`. If `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is set to `2 * m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the next character in `p`, `p` is `p` without the first character, `ans` is 3 * `m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `hmp` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of each character in `s`. If `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is updated to 3 * `m`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
