Output State: **`i` is the third key in `hmp`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, and `ans` is updated accordingly.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated based on the condition given. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. The value of `i` and the structure of `hmp` remain the same as the initial state.
