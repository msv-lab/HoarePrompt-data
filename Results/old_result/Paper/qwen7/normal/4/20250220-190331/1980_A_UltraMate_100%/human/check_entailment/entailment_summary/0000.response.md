Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \(t\). For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\), and the string \(s\) representing the difficulties of the existing problems.

2. **Character Counting**: It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the string \(s\).

3. **Calculating Missing Problems**:
   - For each difficulty level, if it is not present in the string \(s\), the program assumes it needs to create \(m\) problems of that difficulty.
   - If the difficulty level is present but the count is less than \(m\), the program calculates how many additional problems are needed to reach \(m\).

4. **Summing Up**: The program sums up the calculated values for all test cases and prints the result.

Given the execution summary and the provided example, the program correctly handles all scenarios as described. It accurately calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create to ensure there are at least \(m\) problems for each difficulty level.

Correctness: **True**
