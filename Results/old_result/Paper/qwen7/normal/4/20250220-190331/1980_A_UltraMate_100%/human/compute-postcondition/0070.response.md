Output State: **`i` is 'C', `hmp` contains 'A', 'B', 'C', `ans` is `m - 'C'`**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is set to 'C', and `hmp` contains the elements 'A', 'B', 'C'. The code `ans += m - hmp[i]` updates `ans` by adding the result of `m - hmp[i]` to its current value. Since `hmp[i]` is 'C', the expression `m - hmp[i]` evaluates to `m - 'C'`. The other variables remain unchanged.
