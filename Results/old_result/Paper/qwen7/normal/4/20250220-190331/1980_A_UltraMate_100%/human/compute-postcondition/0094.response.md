Output State: **The value of `i` will be the last character in the string `p`, `p` will be an empty string, `ans` will be equal to the length of `p` multiplied by `m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `hmp` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of each character in `s`. If any character in `p` is not in `hmp`, `ans` will be updated accordingly.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be the last character of the original string `p`, which will now be an empty string because all characters have been iterated over. The variable `ans` will hold the total sum of `m` for each character in `p` that was not found in `hmp`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, and `hmp`) remain in their initial or unchanged states.
