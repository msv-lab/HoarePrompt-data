Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `p`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in `p`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the next character in `p`, `p` is the string `p` without the first character, `ans` is `2 * m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `hmp` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of each character in `s`.
   - For the loop to continue, `p` must still contain characters.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be the next character in `p`.
   - `p` will be the string `p` without the first character (which is `i`).
   - `ans` remains unchanged unless `i` is not in `hmp`, in which case it would be set to `2 * m`. Since we don't know if this condition was met, we assume `ans` remains `2 * m`.

5. **Final state**:
   - `i` is the next character in `p`.
   - `p` is `p` without the first character.
   - `ans` is `2 * m`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `m` remains unchanged.
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `hmp` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is the next character in `p`, `p` is `p` without the first character, `ans` is `2 * m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `hmp` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of each character in `s`.**
