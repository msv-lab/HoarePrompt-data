Output State: **`x` is the second last character in `c`, `x` is not in `a`, `x` is not in `b`, `no` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `x`, `a`, `b`, or `no`. It only indicates that the execution will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such loop or conditional block is specified in the code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
