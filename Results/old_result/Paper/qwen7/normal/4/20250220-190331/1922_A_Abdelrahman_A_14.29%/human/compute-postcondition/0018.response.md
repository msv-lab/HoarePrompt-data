Postcondition: `tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `c` is a character (neither `a` nor `b`), `no` is False, and `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
