Postcondition: `tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `c` is a string (either `a` or `b` or neither), `no` is False, and `x` is the last character in `c`. If `c` is either `a` or `b`, `no` is set to False and the loop completes without breaking; otherwise, if any character in `c` is not in `a` or `b`, we break out of the loop and set `no` to False.
