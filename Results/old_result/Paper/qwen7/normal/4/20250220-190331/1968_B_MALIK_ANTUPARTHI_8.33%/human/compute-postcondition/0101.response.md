Postcondition: `b` must be at least 1, `c` is updated to the new value of the second input integer, `i` is `b + 2`, `k` is either `j + 1` or 2, `d` is the new value of the input string, `e` is the new input string, `j` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, if the character at position `j` in `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`, then `k` is also equal to `j + 1`; otherwise, `k` remains 2.
