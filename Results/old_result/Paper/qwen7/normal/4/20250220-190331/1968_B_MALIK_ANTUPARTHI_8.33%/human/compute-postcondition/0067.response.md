Output State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer from the input, `i` is `b + 1`, `k` is `j`, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, and `j` is `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `b`, `c`, `i`, `k`, `d`, `e`, and `j` remain unchanged, and the only effect is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was in.
