Postcondition: `b` must be at least 1, and either `k` is the index of `d[j]` in list `e` plus one, where if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, `k` is equal to `j`, and we break out of the most internal loop or condition.
