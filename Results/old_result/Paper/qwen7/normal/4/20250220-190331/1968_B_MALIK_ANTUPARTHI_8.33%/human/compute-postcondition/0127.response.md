Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts two integers n and m (such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), and two binary strings a and b (where a has length n and b has length m). It returns a result based on the processing of these inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing integers n and m along with binary strings a and b. The function processes these inputs without any direct parameters and returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints.
