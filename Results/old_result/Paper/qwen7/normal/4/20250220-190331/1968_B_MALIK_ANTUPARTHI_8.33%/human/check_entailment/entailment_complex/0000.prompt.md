Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3

    111

    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. a is a binary string of length n, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and similarly, the sum of all m values does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        d = input()
        
        e = input()
        
        k = 0
        
        for j in range(b):
            if d[j] in e[k:]:
                k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
                if k == c or j == b - 1:
                    k = j + 1
                    break
            else:
                k = j
                break
        
        print(k)
        
    #State: Output State: `b` is less than or equal to 0, `c` is an integer from the input, `i` is equal to the sum of `a` (the total number of iterations the loop was supposed to run), `k` is set to `a` (since the loop runs `a` times and `k` is updated accordingly in each iteration), `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, and `j` is `a` (as the loop runs `a` times and `j` reaches `a-1` in the last iteration).
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `b` will be less than or equal to 0 because it gets decremented in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `c` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to `a`, which is the total number of iterations the loop was supposed to run. The variable `k` will be set to `a` because it is updated in each iteration of the loop and reaches the value of `a` after all iterations. The variables `d` and `e` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The variable `j` will be equal to `a` since it runs from 0 to `b-1` in each iteration of the outer loop and `b` becomes 0 after `a` iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts two integers \( n \) and \( m \) (such that \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \)), and two binary strings \( a \) and \( b \) (where \( a \) has length \( n \) and \( b \) has length \( m \)). For each test case, it finds the smallest index \( k \) in string \( b \) where the substring of \( a \) up to the current index matches a substring of \( b \). If no match is found, it prints the length of \( b \). The function returns nothing but prints the result for each test case.
