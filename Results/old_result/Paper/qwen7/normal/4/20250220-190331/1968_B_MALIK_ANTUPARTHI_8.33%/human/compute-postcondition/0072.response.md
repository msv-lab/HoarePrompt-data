Output State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer from the input, `i` is `b + 1`, `k` is `2`, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, and `j` is `1`**.

Explanation: The variable `k` was originally assigned the value of `e.index(d[j]) + 1`. Given that `j` is `1`, `k` was initially `e.index(d[1]) + 1`. After executing `k = j + 1`, `k` is now `1 + 1`, which equals `2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
