Output State: **`b` must be greater than 3, `i` is `b + 2`, `d` is the new value of the input string, `e` is the new input string, `c` is updated to the new value of the second input integer, `j` is 3, `k` is 3.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `j` to `k`. Since `j` is 3, `k` also becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
