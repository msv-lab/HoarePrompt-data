Output State: **`b` is `b + 1`, `c` is an integer from the input, `i` is `b + 1`, `k` is `b`**

Explanation: The initial state had `b` unchanged, `i` as `b + 1`, and `k` as `b`. The code snippet reads two integers from input and assigns them to `b` and `c` respectively using the `map` function combined with `int` to convert the input strings to integers. This changes the value of `b` to the first integer input and `c` to the second integer input. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
