Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: The loop has been executed `b` times. This means that `i` has been incremented by `b` during each iteration.
2. **Loop Head**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(a)`. This means that `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `a`.
3. **Given Information**:
   - After all iterations, `b` remains unchanged.
   - `i` has been incremented by the number of times the loop was executed, which is `b`.
   - `k` is set to `b`.

4. **Determine the New State**:
   - Since the loop has already been executed `b` times, `i` is now equal to `b`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `a`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be incremented by 1 to check if it is still less than `a`.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1` to check if it is still less than `a`.
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is set to `b` and does not change within the loop.

6. **Final State**:
   - `i` is now `b + 1`.
   - `k` remains `b`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`b` remains unchanged, `i` is `b + 1`, `k` is `b`**.
