Output State: **`b` must be at least 1, `j` must be the next integer in the range [0, b-1], `k` is equal to `j`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `j` to `k`. Since `j` is the next integer in the range `[0, b-1]`, `k` now holds the same value as `j`. The conditions for `b` and `j` remain unchanged.
