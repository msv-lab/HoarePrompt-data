Output State: **`b` must be at least 1, `k` is the index of `d[j]` in list `e` plus two and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of `b` or `k`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Therefore, the conditions and values of `b` and `k` remain unchanged.
