Output State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer from the input, `i` is `b + 1`, `k` is `2`, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, and `j` is `1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change any variable values but indicates the exit from the innermost loop or conditional block. All the initial conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
