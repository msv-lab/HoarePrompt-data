Postcondition: `b` must be greater than 2, `i` is `b + 2`, `d` is the new value of the input string, `e` is the new input string, and `k` is updated based on whether the character at position `j` in `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `c` or `k`. Specifically, if the character is present and `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, `k` is set to `j + 2`; otherwise, `k` remains 3. Additionally, `c` is updated to the new value of the second input integer, and `j` remains 3. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
