Postcondition: `ans` is incremented by 1, `r` is `m + 2`, `a[r]` is `a[m + 2]`, and if `old` is in `todo`, `todo` now includes `old` (if `old` was in `extra` and `extra` may have lost an element `a[m + 2]`), `old` is removed from the `done` set (if `old` was in the `done` set), or `todo` now includes `old` (if `old` was not in `extra`); `done` now includes `a[r]` (which is `a[m + 2]`). If `old` is not in `todo`, `extra` includes `a[m + 2]`, and if `old` is in `extra`, then `extra` may have lost an element `a[m + 2]`. If `old` is not in `extra`, `todo` now includes `old`, and `old` is removed from the `done` set. If `old` is in the `done` set, `todo` now includes `old`, and `old` remains in the `done` set.
