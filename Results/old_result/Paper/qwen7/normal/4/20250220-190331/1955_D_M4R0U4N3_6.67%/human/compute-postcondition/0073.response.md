Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1, `old` is equal to `a[m + 1]`, `r` is `m + 2`, `a[r]` is `a[m + 2]`, `extra` may have a new element `a[m + 2]`, and `todo` will depend on the condition mentioned.**

Explanation: The code `old = a[r - m]` updates the value of `old` to be the element at index `r - m` in the list `a`. Given that `r` is initially `m + 2`, `r - m` simplifies to 2, which means `old` is now set to `a[2]`. Since `a[r]` was already `a[m + 2]`, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
