Output State: **`j` is 2; `m` is greater than 0; `extra` contains `a[2]`**

Explanation: The code `extra.add(a[j])` adds the element at index `j` of the list `a` to the set `extra`. Given that `j` is 2, the element `a[2]` is added to `extra`. The values of `j` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
