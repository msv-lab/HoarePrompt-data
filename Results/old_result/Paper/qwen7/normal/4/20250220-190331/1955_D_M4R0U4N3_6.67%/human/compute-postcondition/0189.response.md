Output State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, and 0 otherwise, `r` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The line `extra = set()` creates an empty set named `extra`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
