Output State: **`r` is `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`; `todo` does not contain `a[r]`; `old` is in `extra` or `old` is added to `todo` and `old` is not in `extra` depending on its initial state.**

Explanation: The code `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the element `a[r]` from the list `todo`. Since `a[r]` was initially in `todo` (as per the precondition), it is now removed. The values of `r`, `m`, `n`, `extra`, and `old` remain unchanged unless `old` was equal to `a[r]` and was in `extra`. In that case, `old` would still be in `extra` because it was not added to `todo`.
