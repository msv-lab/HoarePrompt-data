Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for r in range(m, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `r`, `m`, and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `r` is within the range defined by `m` and `n` (i.e., `m <= r < n`).

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `r` is `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`.
   - Since `r` starts from `m` and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `r` will be `m + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `r` will be incremented by 1, so it will be `m + 1`.
   - `m` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The new value of `r` is `m + 1`.
   - `m` and `n` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`**
