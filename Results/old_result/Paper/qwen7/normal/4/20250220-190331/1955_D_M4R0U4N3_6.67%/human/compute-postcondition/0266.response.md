Output State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`; `todo` does not contain the element `a[r]`, `extra` does not change, `done` does not change.**

Explanation: The code `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the element `a[r]` from the list `todo`. Given the initial conditions, `r` is `m + 2`, and `m` is less than or equal to `n` while `n` is greater than `m`. The removal of `a[r]` from `todo` is the only change made by the code. The conditions related to `extra` and `done` remain unchanged as they were not involved in the operation.
