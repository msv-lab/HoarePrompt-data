Output State: **`ans` is equal to `ans` + 1, `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, `todo`, `done`, and `extra` remain unchanged, and the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. No other variables are affected, so `old`, `todo`, `done`, and `extra` remain unchanged. The condition regarding the membership of `a[r]` in `todo`, `done`, or `extra` does not change the values of these variables or `old`. Therefore, the length of `done` remains greater than or equal to `k`.
