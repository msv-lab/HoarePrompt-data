Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input split, `done` is either a set containing `a[0]` or an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[1]` or `a[0]` plus `a[j]`, `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 2 or 3 depending on the condition.**

Explanation: The code `extra.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[j]` to the set `extra`. Since `j` is either 2 or 3, `a[j]` refers to either `a[2]` or `a[3]`. The set `extra` was previously either containing `a[1]` or `a[0]`. After adding `a[j]`, `extra` now contains `a[1]` or `a[0]` plus `a[j]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
