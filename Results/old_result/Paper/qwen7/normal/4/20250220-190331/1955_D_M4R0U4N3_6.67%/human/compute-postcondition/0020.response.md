Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `m`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j < m`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split.
   - `todo` is a set containing integers from the input split.
   - `done` is either a set containing `a[0]` or an empty set.
   - `extra` is either a set containing `a[1]` or `a[0]`.
   - `m` is a positive integer.
   - `j` is 1 or 2 depending on the condition.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is incremented at each iteration, if `j` was 1 or 2 in the previous iteration, it will now be `j + 1`.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged because it is determined before the loop starts and does not change within the loop.

Given that `j` was 1 or 2 in the previous iteration, it will now be 2 or 3 (respectively) for the next iteration. For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `m`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` remains the same: \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` remains the same: a list of integers obtained from the input split.
- `todo` remains the same: a set containing integers from the input split.
- `done` remains the same: either a set containing `a[0]` or an empty set.
- `extra` remains the same: either a set containing `a[1]` or `a[0]`.
- `m` remains the same: a positive integer.
- `j` is now 2 or 3 depending on the condition.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input split, `done` is either a set containing `a[0]` or an empty set, `extra` is either a set containing `a[1]` or `a[0]`, `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 2 or 3 depending on the condition.**
