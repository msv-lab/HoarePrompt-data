Output State: **`r` is `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`; `todo` does not contain `a[r]`; `old` is in `extra` or `old` is added to `todo` and `old` is not in `extra` depending on its initial state; `done` now contains `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code adds `a[r]` to the set `done`. Since `r` is initially equal to `m`, `done` now includes `a[m]`. All other conditions and relationships between variables remain unchanged.
