Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `a`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and was not affected by the code.
