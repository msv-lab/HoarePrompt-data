Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `r` is `m + 1`
- `m` is less than or equal to `n`
- `n` is greater than `m`

### Loop Head:
```
for r in range(m, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Loop Body Analysis:
- The loop starts with `r = m + 1` and increments `r` until `r` reaches `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the value of `r` at the start of the next iteration:**
   - Since `r` starts from `m + 1` and the loop increments `r` by 1 each time, the next value of `r` will be `m + 2`.

2. **Check the conditions for the loop to continue:**
   - The loop continues as long as `r < n`.

3. **Update the states based on the loop head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `r`.

### Updated States:
- `r` will be `m + 2`.
- `m` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.

### Final State:
State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`**
