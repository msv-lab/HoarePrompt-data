Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `todo` is a set of integers from user input, reduced by removing elements that are present in `a`, `done` contains all elements from `todo` that were found in `a` and removed from `todo`, `extra` contains all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from user input, and `m` is greater than 0; `a` is fully processed, and `j` has reached `m`. `ans` is updated to 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is increased by 1, `r` is `m`, `n` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `m` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `old` is either in `todo` and has been moved from `todo` to `done`, or `old` is in `todo` but not in `done`. If `old` is still in `extra`, then `old` is in `todo` and either in `done` but has been removed from `done`, or `old` is not in `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `extra` contains `a[r]`, and if `old` is still in `extra`, then `old` is in `todo` and either in `done` but has been removed from `done`, or `old` is not in `done`. If `old` is no longer present in `extra`, then `old` is either in `todo` and has not been moved from `todo` to `done`, or `old` is in `todo` but not in `done`. Additionally, the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is increased by 1, `r` is updated to `m + 1`, and `old` is either removed from the `extra` list or added to the `todo` set. `done`, `todo`, and `extra` lists remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `a[r]` is found in the `todo` list, `old` is removed from the `extra` list, `todo` is updated to remove `a[r]`, and `a[r]` is added to the `done` list. Otherwise, `old` is added to the `extra` list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is increased by 1, `r` is updated to `m + 2`, `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`. If `a[r]` is in the `todo` list, then `todo` list will have the element `a[r]` removed, and `done` set will now contain the element `a[r]`; otherwise, `extra` list will now contain the element `a[r]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
