Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1, `old` is no longer in `extra`, `r` is `m + 2`, `a[r]` is `a[m + 2]`, and `extra` may have lost an element `a[m + 2]`.**

Explanation: The line `extra.remove(old)` removes the value of `old` from the list `extra`. Given that `old` was previously equal to `a[m + 1]`, it is now removed from `extra`. All other variables remain unchanged.
