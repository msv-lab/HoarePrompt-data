Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1, `r` is `m + 2`, `a[r]` is `a[m + 2]`, `todo` now includes `old` (if `old` was in `extra` and `extra` may have lost an element `a[m + 2]`), `old` is removed from the `done` set (if `old` was in the `done` set), and `todo` now includes `old` (if `old` was not in `extra`); `done` now includes `a[r]` (which is `a[m + 2]`).**

Explanation:
- The line `done.add(a[r])` adds the value of `a[r]` to the set `done`. Since `r` is defined as `m + 2`, `a[r]` is `a[m + 2]`.
- The values of `ans`, `r`, `a[r]`, `todo`, and `old` are updated according to the initial conditions and the operation performed by the code.
- The set `done` now includes the value of `a[r]`, which is `a[m + 2]`.
