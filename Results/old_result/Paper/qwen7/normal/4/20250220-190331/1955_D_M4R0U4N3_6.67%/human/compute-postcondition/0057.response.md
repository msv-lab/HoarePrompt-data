Output State: **`old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, `r` is `m + 1`, `a[r]` is `a[m + 1]`, `todo`, `done`, and `extra` remain unchanged, and `ans` remains unchanged if the length of `done` is less than `k`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `old` to `a[r - m]`. The other variables (`r`, `a[r]`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, and `ans`) remain unchanged based on the condition provided in the initial state.
