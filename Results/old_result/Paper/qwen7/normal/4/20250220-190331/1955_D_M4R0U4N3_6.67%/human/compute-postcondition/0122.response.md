Output State: **`r` is `m`, `n` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `m` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[r - m]` to the variable `old`. Since `r` is equal to `m`, `r - m` equals 0. Therefore, `old` is set to the value of `a[0]`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they were not directly involved in the operation.
