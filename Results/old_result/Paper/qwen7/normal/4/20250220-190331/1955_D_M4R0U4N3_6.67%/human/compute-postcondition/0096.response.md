Output State: **`todo` is a set of integers from user input, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is unchanged, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from user input, and `a` is updated with integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `done = set()` initializes `done` as an empty set. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
