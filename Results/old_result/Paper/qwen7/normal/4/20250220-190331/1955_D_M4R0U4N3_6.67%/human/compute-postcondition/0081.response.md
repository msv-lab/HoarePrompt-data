Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1, `r` is `m + 2`, `a[r]` is `a[m + 2]`, `todo` now includes `old` (if `old` was in `extra` and `extra` may have lost an element `a[m + 2]`), `old` is removed from the `done` set (if `old` was in the `done` set), and `todo` now includes `old` (if `old` was not in `extra`).**

This means that the `remove` operation has been performed on the `todo` set with the element `a[r]`, which is `a[m + 2]`. The `ans` variable has been incremented by 1, and the conditions related to the `old`, `extra`, and `done` sets have been updated according to their respective rules.
