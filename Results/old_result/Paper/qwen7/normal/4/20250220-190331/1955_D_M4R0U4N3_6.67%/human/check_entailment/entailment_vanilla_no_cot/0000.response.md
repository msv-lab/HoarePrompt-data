Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a brief explanation of why:

1. The program iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and the arrays `a` and `b`.
3. It uses sets to keep track of the elements that need to be matched (`todo`) and those that have already been matched (`done`).
4. It also keeps track of additional elements that are not part of `b` but might help in forming a good subsegment (`extra`).
5. It slides a window of size `m` across the array `a`, updating the sets as it moves, and checks if the current window contains at least `k` elements from `b`.
6. If the condition is met, it increments the answer counter.

The logic and implementation are sound and should work correctly for the given constraints.
