Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `r` is `m + 2`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`; if `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not contain the element `a[r]`, `extra` does not change, and `done` contains the element `a[r]`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `extra` now contains the element `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
