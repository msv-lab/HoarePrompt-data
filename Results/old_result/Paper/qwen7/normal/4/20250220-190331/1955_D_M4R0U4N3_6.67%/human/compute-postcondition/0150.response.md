Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `r` is `m + 1`, `n` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `m` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`, `todo`, `done`, and `extra` lists remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k; `old` is removed from the `extra` list.**

Explanation: The code removes the element `old` from the `extra` list. The other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
