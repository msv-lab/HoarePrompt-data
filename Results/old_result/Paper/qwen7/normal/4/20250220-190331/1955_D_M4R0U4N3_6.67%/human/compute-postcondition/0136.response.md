Postcondition: `r` is `m`, `n` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `m` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` is no longer present in `extra`, then `old` is either in `todo` and has been moved from `todo` to `done`, or `old` is in `todo` but not in `done`. If `old` is still in `extra`, then `old` is in `todo` and either in `done` but has been removed from `done`, or `old` is not in `done`. The current value of `a[r]` is in `todo`.
