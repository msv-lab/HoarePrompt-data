Output State: **`old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, `r` is `m + 1`, `todo` contains the value of `old`, `done` does not contain the value of `old`, `a[r]` is `a[m + 1]`, `extra`, and `ans` remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `old` is added to the set `todo`. The set `done` no longer contains the value of `old`. All other variables retain their original values from the initial state.
