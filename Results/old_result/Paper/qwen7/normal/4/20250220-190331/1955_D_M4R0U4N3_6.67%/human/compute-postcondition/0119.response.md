Output State: `todo` is a set of integers from user input, reduced by removing elements that are present in `a` (specifically, elements `a[j]` where `j` ranges from `0` to `m-1`), `done` contains all elements from `todo` that were found in `a` and removed from `todo`, `extra` contains all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from user input, and `m` is greater than 0; `a` is fully processed, and `j` has reached `m`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `todo` will contain any remaining elements that were never found in `a`, `done` will contain all elements that were found in `a` and removed from `todo`, `extra` will contain all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, `ans` will be 1 if the number of unique elements found in `a` and added to `done` is at least `k`, and `m` will be the total number of iterations the loop executed.
