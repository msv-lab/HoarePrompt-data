Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `r` is `m + 1`, `old` is added to the `extra` list, `done`, `todo`, and `extra` lists remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `extra.add(a[r])` adds the element at index `r` of the list `a` to the set `extra`. Since `r` is updated to `m + 1` and `ans` is increased by 1 before this line of code, these changes are reflected. The `old` variable, which was previously considered, is now added to the `extra` list. The `done`, `todo`, and `extra` lists remain unchanged from their previous state, and the condition that the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k` still holds true.
