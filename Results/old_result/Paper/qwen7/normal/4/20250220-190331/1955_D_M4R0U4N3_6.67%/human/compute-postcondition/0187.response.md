Output State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, and 0 otherwise, `r` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code creates a set named `todo` by converting the input (which is a space-separated list of integers) into integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This operation does not affect the values of `ans`, `r`, `a`, or `done`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged except for the new set `todo` which is populated with the integers from the input.
