Output State: **`r` is `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is greater than `m`, `old` is added to `todo`, `old` is not in `extra`, and `old` is in `done` and `old` is removed from `done`.**

The code `todo.add(old)` adds the variable `old` to the set `todo`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding `old` being not in `extra` and being in `done` while also being removed from `done` are still valid.
