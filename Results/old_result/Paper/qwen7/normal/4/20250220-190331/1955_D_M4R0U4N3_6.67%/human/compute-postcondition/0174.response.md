Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `r` is updated to `m + 2`, `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, `todo` list has the element `a[r]` removed.**

Explanation: The code `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the element `a[r]` from the `todo` list. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `ans` is increased by 1, `r` is updated to `m + 2`, `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, and the `todo` list now does not contain the element `a[r]`.
