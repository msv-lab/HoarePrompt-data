Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `high >= cur`.

2. **Identify the variables involved in the loop condition**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `high` and `cur`.

3. **Determine the current values of these variables**:
   - `high` is defined as `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.
   - `cur` is defined as `low`, and `low` is defined as `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.

4. **Check the loop condition with the current values**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.
   - Since `cur` is `low` and `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, we need to ensure that `high` is greater than or equal to `low`.

5. **Determine if any adjustments are necessary**:
   - The current values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers.
   - We need to ensure that `high` (which is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`) is greater than or equal to `cur` (which is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`).

Given that `high` is the maximum of two values and `cur` is the minimum of the same two values, the condition `high >= cur` is inherently true based on the definitions of `high` and `cur`. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is `k-2`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `cur` is `low`**
