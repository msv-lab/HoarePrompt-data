State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500, and t must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer.
3. The problem statement specifies that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 500.
4. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0 and within the specified range.

Hence, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is a valid value for the loop to execute.
