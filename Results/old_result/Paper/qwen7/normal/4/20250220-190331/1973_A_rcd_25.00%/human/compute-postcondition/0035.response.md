Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `high` must be greater than `cur + 1`; `cur` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
