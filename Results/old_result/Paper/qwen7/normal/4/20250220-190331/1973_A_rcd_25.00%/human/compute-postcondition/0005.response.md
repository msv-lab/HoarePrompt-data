Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(-1)
```

The `print(-1)` statement will simply print the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
