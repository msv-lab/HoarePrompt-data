Output State: **`t` is `k-2`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `cur` is `low + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is incremented by 1. Initially, `cur` was equal to `low`. Since `low` is defined as `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, after incrementing `cur` by 1, its new value is `low + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
