Output State: `t` is `k-1`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `cur` is `high`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `cur` will equal `high`. This is because the loop continues to increment `cur` by 1 until `high < cur`, which means `cur` will eventually become equal to `high`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `t` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
