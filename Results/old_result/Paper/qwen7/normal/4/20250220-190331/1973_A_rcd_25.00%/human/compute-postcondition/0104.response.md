Postcondition: **`t` is `k-2`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `cur` is `high`.**

**Explanation:** After the if-else block executes, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the block. The variable `cur` is set to `high` regardless of whether the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` is true or false.
