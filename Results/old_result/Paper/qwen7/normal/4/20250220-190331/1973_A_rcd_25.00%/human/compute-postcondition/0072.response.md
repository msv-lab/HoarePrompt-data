Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is the `_` variable used in the `for _ in range(t):` statement. However, since `_` is a dummy variable, it does not affect the loop execution directly. The actual loop control variables are `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is `k-1`.
   - `p1` is an input integer.
   - `p2` is an input integer.
   - `p3` is an input integer.
   - `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.
   - `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.
   - `cur` is `high` if `p3 < p1 + p2`; otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration of the loop if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0, `t` must be decreased by 1 from its current value `k-1`.
   - The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged.
   - The values of `low` and `high` are derived from `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` and thus remain unchanged.
   - The value of `cur` is determined based on the condition `p3 < p1 + p2` and the parity of the sum `p1 + p2 + p3`. Since these conditions do not change with each iteration, `cur` remains the same unless the loop exits due to the sum being odd.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is `k-2`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `cur` is `high` if `p3 < p1 + p2`; otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration of the loop if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.**
