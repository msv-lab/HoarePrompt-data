Output State: **`t` is `k-1`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `cur` is `cur + 2`**

Explanation: The variable `cur` was initially set to `cur + 1`, and the code snippet increments `cur` by 1 again. Therefore, `cur` is now `cur + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
