Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split.
   - If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then `t` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged, and after all iterations of the loop, `cur` will be either `high` or the value that makes `p1 - cur` less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, whichever comes last during the loop's execution.
   - The loop will print either `p1 - cur + p3` if the condition is met before the loop ends, or it will print `p3` if no such `cur` is found.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `_`: This is a dummy variable used for looping and does not affect the state.
   - `t`: The number of iterations left.
   - `p1`, `p2`, `p3`: These are input values that do not change within the loop.
   - `cur`: This is a variable that changes within the loop.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop is iterating based on the value of `t`, we need to decrease `t` by 1 for each iteration.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged as they are input values.
   - `cur` is a variable that changes within the loop, but its initial state is not provided, so we cannot determine its exact value without the loop body. However, we know that after the loop, `cur` will be either `high` or the value that satisfies the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.

Given the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `t`.

**State:**
- `t` is decreased by 1, so if `t` was initially `k`, after one iteration `t` becomes `k-1`.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged.
- `cur` is not specified in the loop head, so we cannot adjust it here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
**State: **`t` is `k-1`, `p1` is the same, `p2` is the same, `p3` is the same**.
