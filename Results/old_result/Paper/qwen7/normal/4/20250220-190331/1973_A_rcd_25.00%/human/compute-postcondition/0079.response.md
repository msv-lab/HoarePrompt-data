Output State: **`t` is `k-2`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `cur` is `low`.**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `cur` from `high` to `low`. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `cur` being set to `low`.
