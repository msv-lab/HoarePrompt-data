Output State: **`t` is `k-1`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `cur` is `low`, and `(p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur))`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional structure. All the initial conditions and relationships between the variables remain unchanged.
