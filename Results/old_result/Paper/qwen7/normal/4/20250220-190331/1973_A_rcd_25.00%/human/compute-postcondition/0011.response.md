Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned from the input split.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

We need to determine the value of `p1 + p2`.

Given that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, it implies that `p1 + p2` must be even. This is because the sum of two even numbers or two odd numbers is even, and adding an odd number (`p3`) to an even number results in an odd number. Therefore, `p1 + p2` must be even to ensure that the total sum `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd.

Since the exact values of `p1` and `p2` are not specified, we can only describe the result in terms of their sum.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 + p2 is an even number)**
