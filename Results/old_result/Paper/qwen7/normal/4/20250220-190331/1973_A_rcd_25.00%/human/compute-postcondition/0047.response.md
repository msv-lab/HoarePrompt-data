Output State: **`t` is `k-1`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the minimum value between `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` to `low`, and the maximum value between `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` to `high`. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged. The condition for continuing the loop (sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being odd) is not affected by this assignment.
