Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional block it is inside. Since no new assignments or operations are performed, all the conditions and values of the variables remain as they were in the initial state.
