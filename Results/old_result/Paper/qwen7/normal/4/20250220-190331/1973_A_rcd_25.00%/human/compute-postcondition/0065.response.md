Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t = k - 1`: This means `t` is set to `k - 1`.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers.
   - `low = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`: This sets `low` to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high >= cur + 2`: This indicates that `high` is greater than or equal to `cur + 2`.
   - There is a conditional check: `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(p1 - cur + p3)`.

To determine what will be printed, let's consider the possible scenarios for the conditional check:

### Scenario 1: The Condition is True
- If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, the loop or if statement will break, and the value of `cur` will remain unchanged from its initial value (which is 0 unless otherwise specified).

### Scenario 2: The Condition is False
- If `p1 - cur > p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then `cur` will be incremented by 2. Since `cur` starts at 0, after the first iteration, `cur` will be 2.

Given these scenarios, let's evaluate the print statement in both cases:

#### Case 1: The Condition is True
- If the condition is true, `cur` remains 0.
- Therefore, `p1 - cur + p3` becomes `p1 - 0 + p3` which simplifies to `p1 + p3`.

#### Case 2: The Condition is False
- If the condition is false, `cur` becomes 2.
- Therefore, `p1 - cur + p3` becomes `p1 - 2 + p3` which simplifies to `p1 + p3 - 2`.

Since the problem does not specify which scenario occurs, we need to consider both possibilities. However, the most precise answer based on the given information would be:

Output: **p1 + p3 - 2 (if p1 - cur > p2 - (p3 - cur)), p1 + p3 (otherwise)**
