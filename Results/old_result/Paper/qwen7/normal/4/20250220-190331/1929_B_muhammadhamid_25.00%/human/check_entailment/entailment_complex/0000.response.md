Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
2. The solution provided handles different cases based on the value of \( k \):
   - If \( k = 1 \), the answer is 1.
   - If \( k \leq 2n \), the answer is \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).
   - Otherwise, the answer is \( k / 2 + 1 \).

Let's analyze these cases:
- When \( k = 1 \), coloring any single cell will satisfy the condition since there are 4n - 2 diagonals, and coloring one cell will ensure at least one diagonal has a colored cell.
- When \( k \leq 2n \), the formula \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) works because each pair of diagonals (one from each direction) can share a cell. For example, if \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \), we need to color 2 cells to cover 4 diagonals.
- When \( k > 2n \), the formula \( k / 2 + 1 \) ensures that we account for the remaining diagonals. For example, if \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \), we need to color 4 cells to cover 10 diagonals.

Given the logic and the examples provided, the solution correctly implements the required functionality.
