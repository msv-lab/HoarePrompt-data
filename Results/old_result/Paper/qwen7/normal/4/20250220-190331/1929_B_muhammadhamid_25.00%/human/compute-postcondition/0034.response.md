Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the given \( n \) and \( k \). If \( k \) is 1, it prints 1. If \( k \) is less than or equal to \( 2n \), it prints the ceiling of \( k/2 \). Otherwise, it prints \( k/2 + 1 \). After processing all test cases, it ensures that the number of remaining test cases \( t \) is reduced to 0.**
