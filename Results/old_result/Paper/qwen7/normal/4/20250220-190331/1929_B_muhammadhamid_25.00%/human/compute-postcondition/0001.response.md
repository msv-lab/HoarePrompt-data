Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000.
