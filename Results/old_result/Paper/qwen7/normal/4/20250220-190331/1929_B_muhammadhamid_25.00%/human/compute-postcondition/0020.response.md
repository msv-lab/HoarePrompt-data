Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an integer obtained from the first input.
- `k` is the second integer obtained from the first input and is less than or equal to 2 times `n`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(math.ceil(k / 2))
```

Here, `math.ceil(k / 2)` will take the value of `k`, divide it by 2, and then round up to the nearest integer if the division result is not already an integer.

Since the exact values of `k` and `n` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `math.ceil(k / 2)`. However, we know that `k` is less than or equal to \(2n\), so `k / 2` will be less than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, the output will be the ceiling of `k / 2`, which is an integer value between 1 and `n` (inclusive).

Output: **math.ceil(k / 2) (where k is an integer less than or equal to 2 times n)**
