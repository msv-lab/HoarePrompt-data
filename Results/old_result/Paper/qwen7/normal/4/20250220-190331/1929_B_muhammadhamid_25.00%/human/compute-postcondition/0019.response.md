Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the first input and is less than or equal to 2 times `n`, and after the execution of the if else block, `t` remains within the range 1 to 1000, and the program continues with the next iteration or statement.
