Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `k` is the second integer input converted to an integer and is less than or equal to 2 times `n`, and if `k` equals 1, we continue the loop. If `k` is not 1, the loop continues as well since there is no else part changing the condition.
