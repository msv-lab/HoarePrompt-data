Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2. The loop processes each test case individually, updating `t` to reflect the number of remaining test cases after each iteration. Once all test cases have been processed, `t` will be reduced to 0, indicating that there are no more test cases left to process.**

This means that after all the iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `t` will be 0, as it starts at a value between 1 and 1000 and is decremented by 1 for each test case processed until it reaches 0. The values of `n` and `k` will be those provided for the last test case processed, but the exact values depend on the inputs given during the execution of the loop.
