### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution checks three main conditions:
     1. If \( k = 1 \), it prints `1`.
     2. If \( k \leq 2n \), it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
     3. Otherwise, it prints \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).

3. **Checking Each Condition:**
   - **Condition 1:** If \( k = 1 \):
     - This condition is straightforward and correct. Coloring one cell will always satisfy the requirement of having at least one colored cell in one diagonal.
   - **Condition 2:** If \( k \leq 2n \):
     - For this case, the solution uses \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
     - Let's verify why this works:
       - In an \( n \times n \) grid, we can color cells in such a way that every other diagonal gets at least one colored cell.
       - For example, if \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \), we can color cells (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), and (1,3) to cover 4 diagonals.
       - The formula \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) ensures that we are covering as many diagonals as needed without over-coloring.
   - **Condition 3:** If \( k > 2n \):
     - The solution uses \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).
     - This condition is more complex. We need to ensure that the additional cells are correctly counted.
     - For \( k > 2n \), we need to ensure that we are covering all required diagonals. The formula \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \) seems to account for the extra cells needed beyond \( 2n \).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles edge cases like \( k = 1 \) and \( k \leq 2n \) correctly.
   - For \( k > 2n \), the solution might not be optimal but still provides a valid answer.

However, upon closer inspection, there are some issues with the logic in the third condition:

- When \( k > 2n \), the solution \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \) does not necessarily provide the minimum number of cells required. Consider the following example:
  - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \):
    - According to the solution, the answer would be \( \frac{10}{2} + 1 = 6 \).
    - However, we can achieve the requirement with fewer cells. By coloring cells (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (1,2), (2,3), and (1,3), we can cover all 10 diagonals with just 6 cells.

Therefore, the solution provided is not always optimal and may overestimate the number of cells needed.

### Conclusion:
The given solution does not always provide the minimum number of cells required to satisfy the condition. While it handles some cases correctly, it fails to provide the optimal solution for certain values of \( k \).

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
