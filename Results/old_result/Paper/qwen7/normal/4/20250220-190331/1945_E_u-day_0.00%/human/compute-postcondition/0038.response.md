Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables:**
   The loop head is `while low + 1 < high:`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop condition are `low` and `high`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `st` retain their original values.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `low + 1 < high`.

3. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - For the loop to continue, `low + 1 < high` must be true.
   - This implies that `high` must be greater than `low + 1`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `low` and `high` are the only variables in the loop condition, they are the ones that need to be adjusted.
   - We need to ensure that `low + 1 < high` holds true for the next iteration.

5. **Ensuring the Condition:**
   - To ensure `low + 1 < high` is true, we need to guarantee that `high` is greater than `low + 1`.
   - This means `high` should be at least `low + 2`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `high` to be at least `low + 2`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`low`, `high`, `mid`, and `st` retain their original values, and `high` must be greater than `low + 1` (specifically, `high` must be at least `low + 2`).**

This ensures that the condition `low + 1 < high` remains true for the next iteration of the loop.
