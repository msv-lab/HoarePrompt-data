Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code initializes `arr` by calling the function `func_2()`. Since `n` and `k` are determined by the function `func_1()`, their values remain unchanged. The new variable `arr` is assigned the result of `func_2()`, which is a list (or any iterable) generated by the function.
