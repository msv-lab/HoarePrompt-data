Output State: **`low` is `mid`, `high` is `n-1`, `mid` is `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`, `st` is a set containing the value of `mid`, and `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The variable `low` is updated to be equal to `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `mid` is still `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`, `st` is still a set containing the value of `mid`, and the condition that `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k` remains true.
