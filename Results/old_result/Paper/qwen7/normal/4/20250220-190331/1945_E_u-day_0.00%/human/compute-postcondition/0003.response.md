Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts (this is the default behavior of the `range` function).
   - `n` is given as a positive integer representing the length of the permutation.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, the condition `n > 0` must be true. This is because the `range(n)` function generates a sequence from 0 to `n-1`, and if `n` is 0 or negative, the sequence will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be set to 0.
   - `n` must be a positive integer.

Given the initial state where `pos` is -1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), and `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, the relevant variables for the loop are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer**
