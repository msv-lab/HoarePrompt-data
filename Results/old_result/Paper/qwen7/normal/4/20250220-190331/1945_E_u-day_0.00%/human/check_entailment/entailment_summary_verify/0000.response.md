### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Problem Description Analysis:**
   - We need to rearrange the permutation such that after performing a binary search, the element at position `l` is equal to `x`.
   - The binary search algorithm should be applied to a sorted version of the permutation, but we can perform at most 2 swaps to make the permutation sorted.

2. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function `func_3` currently only performs a binary search and prints the index of the target value if found, or the indices for a swap if not found.
   - The function does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure that the target value is at the start of the array after the binary search.

3. **Current Implementation Analysis:**
   - The function `func_3` does not handle the swapping logic as described in the problem statement. It only finds the target value's position and prints the indices for a potential swap, but it does not actually perform the swap.
   - The binary search algorithm itself is implemented correctly, but the post-processing step to ensure the target value is at the start is missing.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To ensure the target value is at the start of the array, we need to identify the correct positions to swap.
   - If the target value is not at the start, we need to find the correct positions to swap to bring it to the start.

Given the above analysis, the current implementation is indeed incorrect because it does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure the target value is at the start of the array after the binary search.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure that the target value is at the start of the array after the binary search.
