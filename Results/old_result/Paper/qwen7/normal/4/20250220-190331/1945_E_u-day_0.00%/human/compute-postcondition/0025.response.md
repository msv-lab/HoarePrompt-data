Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `mid`, `mid` is `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`, `st` is a set containing the value of `mid`, and the current value of `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`.**

Explanation: The code `high = mid` updates the value of `high` to be equal to `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `mid` was previously defined as `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`, `high` now holds the same value as `mid`. The set `st` and the condition about `arr[mid]` being greater than `k` remain the same.
