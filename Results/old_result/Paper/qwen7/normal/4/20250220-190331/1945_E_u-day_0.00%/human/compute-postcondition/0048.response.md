Based on the initial state provided:

- `low` and `high` are consecutive integers such that `low + 1 == high`.
- `st` is a set containing all the unique midpoints calculated during the loop iterations.
- `mid` is the last midpoint calculated, which is `(low + high) // 2`.
- `arr[mid]` is equal to `k`.

The print statement is simply `print(0)`. This means that regardless of the values of the other variables, the print statement will output the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
