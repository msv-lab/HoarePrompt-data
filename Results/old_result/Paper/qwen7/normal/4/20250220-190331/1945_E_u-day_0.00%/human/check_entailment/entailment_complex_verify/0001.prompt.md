You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes three inputs: `n` (the length of the permutation), `k` (an integer between 1 and `n`), and `arr` (a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`). It performs a binary search on `arr` to find the position of `k`. If `k` is found, it prints `0`. If `k` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the indices `high` and `pos + 1`. The function returns nothing but prints the result based on the search outcome.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1()`: This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - `func_2()`: This function converts the result of `func_1()` into a list.
   - `func_3()`: This function is supposed to implement the logic to find the position of `k` in the permutation and perform swaps if necessary to ensure `p_l` is equal to `x`.

2. **Function `func_3()`**:
   - **Reading Input**: The function reads `n` and `k` from the input using `func_1()`.
   - **Finding Position**: It finds the index `pos` where the value `k` is located in the permutation `arr`.
   - **Binary Search Logic**:
     - The function initializes `low` and `high` to `0` and `n - 1`, respectively.
     - It uses a set `st` to store mid-values, but this set is never used in the logic.
     - It performs a binary search to find the correct position for `k`.
     - If `arr[low]` equals `k`, it prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.
     - Otherwise, it prints `1` and performs a swap between `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic in `func_3()` is incorrect. The purpose of binary search here is to find the correct position for `k` such that `p_l` becomes `k`. However, the binary search is not correctly implemented to achieve this.
   - The binary search should aim to place `k` at the `l` position, not just find its current position.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program only performs one swap, which is insufficient in many cases. As per the problem statement, up to two swaps are allowed, but the current implementation only handles one swap.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is not consistent with the problem requirements. The program should output the number of swaps and the pairs of indices for each swap.

### Correctness Analysis

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
