### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the provided program does not meet the requirements:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to rearrange the permutation such that after performing the binary search, the element at position `l` is equal to `x`.
   - The binary search algorithm should place `x` at the start of the array (`p_l = x`).

2. **Current Implementation**:
   - `func_3` performs a binary search to find the position of `x` in the array.
   - If `x` is found, it prints `0`.
   - If `x` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the indices `high` and `pos + 1`.

3. **Issues**:
   - The function does not perform any swaps to rearrange the array.
   - The binary search only checks if `x` exists in the array and does not modify the array to ensure `x` is at the start.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the test case:
     - \( n = 6 \)
     - \( x = 3 \)
     - Permutation: \( [4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6] \)
   - The target value `3` is at index 1.
   - The binary search will not move `3` to the start of the array because no swaps are performed.
   - The output will be `1` and the indices `2` and `2`, which means the binary search did not find `3` and placed `2` at the start instead.

5. **Required Solution**:
   - To fix this, we need to identify the correct positions to swap to bring `x` to the start of the array.
   - The current implementation does not achieve this, as it only performs a binary search without any rearrangement.

Given these points, the original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
