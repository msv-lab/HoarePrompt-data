Output State: **`low` retains its original value, `high` is equal to (`low` + `mid`), `mid` is equal to (`low` + `high`) // 2, `st` retains its original value, and `st` now contains the value of `mid`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `high` to be equal to `mid`. The other variables (`low`, `mid`, `st`) retain their original values, with `mid` being updated to (`low` + `high`) // 2 before the assignment.
