Output State: The loop terminates when `low + 1 >= high`. At this point, `low` will be equal to `high - 1`, and `st` will contain all the midpoints calculated during the iterations. The value of `mid` will be the last midpoint calculated before the loop condition was no longer satisfied. The values of `arr[mid]` will either be greater than `k` or less than or equal to `k`, depending on the position of `k` within the array `arr`.

In more detail, the output state will be:
- `low` and `high` will be consecutive integers such that `low + 1 == high`.
- `st` will be a set containing all the unique midpoints calculated during the loop iterations.
- `mid` will be the last midpoint calculated, which is `(low + high) // 2`.
- `arr[mid]` will either be greater than `k` or less than or equal to `k`, depending on the binary search process.
