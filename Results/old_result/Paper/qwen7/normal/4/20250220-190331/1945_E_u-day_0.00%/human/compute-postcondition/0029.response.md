Postcondition: `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `st` are as follows: if `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, then `low` is 0, `high` is `mid`, `mid` is `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`, and `st` is a set containing the value of `mid`. Otherwise, `low` is `mid`, `high` is `n-1`, `mid` is `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`, and `st` is a set containing the value of `mid`.
