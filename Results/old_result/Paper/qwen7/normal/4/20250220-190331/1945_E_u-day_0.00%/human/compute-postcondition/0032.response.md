Output State: **`low` is 0 and `high` is `mid` with `mid > 1`, or `low` is `mid` and `high` is `n-1` with `mid < n-2`; `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mid` to be the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high`. Given the initial conditions, `mid` will now be `(0 + high) // 2` in the first case and `(low + (n-1)) // 2` in the second case. The other variables remain unchanged.
