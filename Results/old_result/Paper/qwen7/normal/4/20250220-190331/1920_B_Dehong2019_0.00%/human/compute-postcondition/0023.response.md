Output State: **`ans1` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[i + x]`, and `i` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `ans1` is decreased by twice the value of `a[i + x]`. The initial state of `ans1` being increased by the value of `a[i]` and `i` remaining unchanged is still valid, but now `ans1` has been further modified by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as specified in the initial state.
