Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(x)`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - The loop body involves an operation where `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2 + a[1] * 2`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < x`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

5. **Update the State:**
   - `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `x` remains the same.
   - The operation `ans1 -= a[0] * 2 + a[1] * 2` will be performed again in the next iteration.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `x` is the same as before, and `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2 + a[1] * 2`**.

Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we will keep it as "the same as before" to indicate that it hasn't changed from the previous iteration.

Final State: **`i` is 2, `x` is the same as before, and `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2 + a[1] * 2`**.
