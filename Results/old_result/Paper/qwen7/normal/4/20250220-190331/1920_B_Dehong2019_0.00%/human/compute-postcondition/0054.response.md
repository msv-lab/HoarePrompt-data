Postcondition: `x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is equal to `x`, `ans1` is increased by `a[i]` and then decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`, provided that the sum of `i` and `x` is less than `n`. If the sum of `i` and `x` is not less than `n`, the value of `ans1` remains as it was after the initial increase by `a[i]`.
