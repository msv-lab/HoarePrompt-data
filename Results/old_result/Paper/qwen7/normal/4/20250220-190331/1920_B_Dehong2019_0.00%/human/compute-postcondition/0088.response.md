Postcondition: `t` is `k + 1`, `x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is either 1 or 2, `ans1` is the original sum of the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[0]`, adjusted based on whether `i` is 1 or 2, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` which remains equal to `ans1`, and `i + x` is less than `n`.
