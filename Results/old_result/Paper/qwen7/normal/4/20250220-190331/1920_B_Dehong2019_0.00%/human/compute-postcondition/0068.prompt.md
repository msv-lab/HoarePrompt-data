Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to the value of `x`; `ans1` is decreased by the sum of each element in list `a` multiplied by 2 for every iteration up to `x`; `ans2` is equal to `ans1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    ans1 += a[i]
    if i + x < n:
        ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
    ans = max(ans1, ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is equal to `x`, `ans1` is increased by `a[i]` and then decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`, provided that the sum of `i` and `x` is less than `n`. If the sum of `i` and `x` is not less than `n`, the value of `ans1` remains as it was after the initial increase by `a[i]`; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is `x + 1`, `ans1` is increased by `a[i]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise `ans1` remains unchanged, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is `x + 2`, `ans1` is increased by `a[i]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise `ans1` remains unchanged, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
