Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `x` is less than or equal to `k`
   - `i` is `x + 1`
   - `ans1` is increased by `a[i]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise `ans1` remains unchanged
   - `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(k):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop variable `i` in the loop head ranges from `0` to `k-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `x + 1`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `x + 2`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `x` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` changes from `x + 1` to `x + 2`.
   - `ans1` and `ans` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine their exact values without the loop body.

6. **Final State:**
   - `x` is still less than or equal to `k`.
   - `i` is now `x + 2`.
   - `ans1` and `ans` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is `x + 2`, `ans1` is increased by `a[i]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise `ans1` remains unchanged, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`**
