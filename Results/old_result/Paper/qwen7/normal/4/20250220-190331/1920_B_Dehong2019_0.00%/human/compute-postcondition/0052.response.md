Output State: **`x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is equal to `x`, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`, and the sum of `i` and `x` is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` decreases the value of `ans1` by twice the value of `a[i + x]`. The values of `x`, `i`, `ans1`, and the condition involving their sum being less than `n` remain unchanged.
