Output State: **`t` is `k + 1`, `x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans1` is the new value of `ans1 - a[i] * 2`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`**.

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` updates `ans1` by subtracting `2 * a[i]` from its current value. The values of `t`, `x`, `i`, `ans`, and `ans2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
