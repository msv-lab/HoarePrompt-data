Output State: **`x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is `x + 1`, `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += a[i]` increases `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `x` is still less than or equal to `k`, `i` is still `x + 1`, `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, and `ans` is still the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
