Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `pow` is multiplied by 2, so `pow` becomes `2 * pow`.
   - `k` is updated to `k - tot`.
   - `tot` remains unchanged.
   - `L` is a list with at least 2 elements, but its specific contents are not relevant to the print statement.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement to be executed is `print(pow * (2 * k - 1))`.

Given these points, let's determine what will be printed:

- `pow` is now `2 * pow`.
- `k` is updated to `k - tot`.

Substituting these into the print statement:
\[ \text{print}(2 \cdot \text{pow} \cdot (2 \cdot (\text{k} - \text{tot}) - 1)) \]

Simplifying inside the parentheses:
\[ 2 \cdot (\text{k} - \text{tot}) - 1 = 2 \cdot \text{k} - 2 \cdot \text{tot} - 1 \]

So the expression becomes:
\[ 2 \cdot \text{pow} \cdot (2 \cdot \text{k} - 2 \cdot \text{tot} - 1) \]

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2 * pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)**
