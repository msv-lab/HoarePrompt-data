Postcondition: `L` must contain at least one element, `pow` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `m` is 0, `tot` is less than `k` but `k` is less than or equal to `tot` plus the first element of `L`, `n` is 0, and either `tot` is updated to `tot` plus the first element of `L` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken, or `tot`, `k`, `m`, `n`, and `pow` retain their original values.
