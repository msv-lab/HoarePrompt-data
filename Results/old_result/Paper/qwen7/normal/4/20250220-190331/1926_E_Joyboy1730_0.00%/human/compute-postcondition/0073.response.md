Postcondition: `L` must contain at least one element, `pow` is 2, `k` is adjusted based on the value of `tot` and `a`. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, then `k` is set to `k - tot` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `tot < k and k <= tot + a` is not met, then the values of `k`, `m`, and `n` remain unchanged.
