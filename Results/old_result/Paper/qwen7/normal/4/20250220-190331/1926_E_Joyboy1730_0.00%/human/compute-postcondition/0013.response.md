Output State: `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is equal to \((n + 1) // 2\).

After all iterations of the loop, `n` will eventually become 0 because the loop reduces `n` by \((n + 1) // 2\) in each iteration. Once `n` reaches 0, the condition `n` in the while loop evaluates to False, and the loop terminates. At this point, `t` remains unchanged within its given range, `k` remains an input integer, and `L` remains an empty list. The value of `m` will be \((0 + 1) // 2 = 0\) since `n` is 0.
