Output State: `n` is 0, `m` is 0, `L` is an empty list, `pow` is \(2^n\), `k` is an input integer, and `tot` is the cumulative sum of all elements in `L`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `n` is non-zero. After each iteration, `n` is reduced by `m`, which is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` starts from some positive integer and keeps getting halved (rounded down) in each iteration, eventually `n` will reach 0. Once `n` becomes 0, the condition `n:` in the while loop evaluates to False, and the loop terminates. At this point, both `m` and `n` become 0, and the list `L` remains empty with `tot` being the cumulative sum of its elements, which is 0 since the list is empty.
