Output State: **`t` must be an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is equal to \((n + 1) // 2\)**.

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the value of `m` to be `(n + 1) // 2`, which is the same as its previous definition. All other variables remain unchanged.
