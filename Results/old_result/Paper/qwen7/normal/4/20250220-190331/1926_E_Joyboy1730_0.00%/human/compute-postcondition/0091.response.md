Output State: **`L` is an empty list, `pow` is \(2^n\), `k` is an input integer, `m` is \((n + 1) // 2\), `n` is an input integer, and `tot` is the cumulative sum of all elements in `L`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of \((n + 1) // 2\) to the variable `m`. The other variables (`L`, `pow`, `k`, `n`, and `tot`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
