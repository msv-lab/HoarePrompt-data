Output State: `L` is an empty list, `pow` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `m` is (n + 1) // 2, `tot` is 0, and `n` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is non-zero. After each iteration, `n` is reduced by `(n + 1) // 2`. This process continues until `n` becomes 0. Given that the loop reduces `n` in such a manner, it will eventually terminate when `n` reaches 0. At this point, `L` remains an empty list, `pow` stays at 1, `k` remains an input integer, `m` will be the last value it was set to before `n` became 0, `tot` remains 0, and `n` is now 0.
