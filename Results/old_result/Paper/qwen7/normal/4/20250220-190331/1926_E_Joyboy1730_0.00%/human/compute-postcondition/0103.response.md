Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for a in L:`. This means the loop variable is `a` and the iterable is `L`.

2. **Determine the objects in the loop head**: The only object in the loop head is `L`. The loop variable `a` will take on each value from the list `L` during each iteration.

3. **Check the condition for loop execution**: For the loop to execute, the list `L` must contain at least one element. If `L` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Given the initial state where `L` is an empty list, we need to ensure that `L` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other states**: The states of `n`, `m`, `pow`, `k`, and `tot` are not directly related to the loop's execution based on the given loop head. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `L` must have at least one element.

Thus, the final state is:

**State: **`L` is an empty list, but must have at least 1 element**.
