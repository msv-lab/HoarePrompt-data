The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates a sequence of integers \( m \) derived from \( n \) through repeated division by 2, and uses these values to determine a specific output based on \( k \). The function prints the result for each test case and returns nothing.
