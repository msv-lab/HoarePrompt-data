Output State: **`L` is an empty list, `pow` is 1, `n` is non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `m` is 2, `tot` is 0, and `a` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `m` to `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` is non-zero, `n + 1` is an integer greater than 1. Dividing this by 2 using integer division results in `m` being set to 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
