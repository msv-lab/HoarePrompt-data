Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for itest in range(0, t, 1):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('Yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `itest` remains 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split. If the condition (n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k) is true, then either `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` holds. Otherwise, `n > k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `itest` is 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `n` and `m` are integers, `k` is an integer. The condition of the if statement does not change the values of these variables, so the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `itest` is 2, `n` is an integer obtained from input, `m` is an integer obtained from input, `k` is an integer obtained from input. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
