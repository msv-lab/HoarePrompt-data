Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. If `n <= k`, it prints 'NO'.
     2. If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it also prints 'NO'.
     3. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

3. **Condition 1: `n <= k`**
   - This condition checks if Bob can repaint all parts. If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so Alice cannot prevent this. Therefore, the program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.

4. **Condition 2: `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`**
   - This condition checks if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
   - `math.ceil(n / m)` calculates the minimum number of different colors needed to ensure that at least one color appears at least `ceil(n / m)` times.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it means Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, so the program should print 'NO'. 
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`, it means Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color, so the program should print 'Yes'.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` correctly.
   - For other cases, the program prints 'Yes', which is correct according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. 

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
