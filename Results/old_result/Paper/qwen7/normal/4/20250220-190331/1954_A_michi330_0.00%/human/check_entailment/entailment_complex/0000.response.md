Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
2. The logic in the given code checks two conditions:
   - `n <= k`: This condition checks if Bob can repaint all parts.
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`: This condition checks if Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color after Alice has painted them with `m` different colors.
3. If either of these conditions is true, the code correctly prints 'NO', indicating that Alice cannot achieve her goal.
4. If neither condition is true, the code prints 'Yes', indicating that Alice can achieve her goal.
5. The conditions in the code accurately reflect the problem statement and ensure that the output is correct for all given constraints (1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).

Given this analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
