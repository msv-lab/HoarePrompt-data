Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is the first input integer minus 1.
- `f` is the first input integer minus 3.
- `k` is the first input integer minus 3.
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
- `x` is the value of `a[f]`.
- `a[k]` remains unchanged.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **YES**
