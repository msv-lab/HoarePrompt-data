Functionality: **The function accepts a single parameter `t`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each value of `t`, the function processes a set of three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` (where 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100) along with a list of `n` integers `a_i` (where 1 <= a_i <= 100). The function does not return a specific value but rather processes the given inputs according to the specified conditions.**
