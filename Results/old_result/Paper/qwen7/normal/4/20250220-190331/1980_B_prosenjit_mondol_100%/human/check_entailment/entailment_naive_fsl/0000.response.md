Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where the favorite cube is exactly at the k-th position after sorting but still gets removed because the (k+1)-th cube has the same value as the favorite cube.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
5 5 5
1 2 5 4 3
```
- Expected Output: "YES"
- Program Output: "MAYBE"

In this case, after sorting, the array becomes `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`. The favorite cube (value 5) is at the first position, and `k` is also 5. Since the program checks only if `a[k] > x` or `a[k] < x`, it incorrectly outputs "MAYBE" instead of "YES".

To fix this, the program needs to check if the (k+1)-th cube has the same value as the favorite cube and handle it accordingly.
