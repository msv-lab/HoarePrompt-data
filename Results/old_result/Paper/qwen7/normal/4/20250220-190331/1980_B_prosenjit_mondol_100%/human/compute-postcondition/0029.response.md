Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `f` is the first input integer minus 2, so \(f = n - 2\).
- `k` is the first input integer minus 2, so \(k = n - 2\).
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- `x` is the value of `a[f]`, where \(f = n - 2\).
- `a[k]` remains unchanged, where \(k = n - 2\).

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string 'NO'.

Output: **'NO'**
