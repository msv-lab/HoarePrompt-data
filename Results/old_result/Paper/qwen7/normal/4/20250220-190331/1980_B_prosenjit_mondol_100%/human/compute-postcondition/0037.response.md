Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first input integer minus 1, `f` is the first input integer minus 3, `k` is the first input integer minus 3, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `x` is the value of `a[f]`, `a[k]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 1. Initially, `k` was equal to the first input integer minus 2 (`k = first\_input - 2`). After decrementing `k` by 1, `k` now equals the first input integer minus 3 (`k = first\_input - 3`). All other variables remain unchanged.
