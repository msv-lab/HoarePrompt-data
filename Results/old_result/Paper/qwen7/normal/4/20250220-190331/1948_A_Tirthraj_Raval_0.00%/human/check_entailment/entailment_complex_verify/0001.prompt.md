You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), and `pattern` is either an empty list or contains a sequence of characters 'A' and 'B' as described by the loop's behavior.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and checks if `n` is odd or even. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it prints 'YES' and then generates a pattern consisting of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters of length `n`. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Checking for Special Characters:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to have exactly `n` special characters in a string where each special character must be different from exactly one of its neighbors.
   - If `n` is even, it proceeds to construct a string with `n` special characters.

3. **Constructing the String:**
   - The program constructs a pattern using 'A' and 'B'.
   - It alternates between 'A' and 'B' to ensure that each character is special. Specifically, it uses the pattern "ABABAB..." to achieve this.
   - The length of the pattern constructed is `n // 2 * 2`, which is always less than or equal to 200 for the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

4. **Printing the Result:**
   - If a suitable string can be constructed (i.e., `n` is even), it prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string.
   - If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'.

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with the provided examples:

#### Test Case 1: \( n = 6 \)
- The program will check if 6 is odd (it's not).
- It will construct the string "ABABAB" and print "YES ABABAB".

#### Test Case 2: \( n = 1 \)
- The program will check if 1 is odd (it is).
- It will print "NO".

#### Test Case 3: \( n = 2 \)
- The program will check if 2 is odd (it's not).
- It will construct the string "AB" and print "YES AB".

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the problem description accurately. It checks for the parity of `n` and constructs the appropriate string when possible.
