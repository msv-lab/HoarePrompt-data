Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `pattern` contains 'A' and 'B'.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n // 2`.

4. **Analyze the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n // 2`.
   - Since `i` is now 2, `n // 2` must be greater than 2.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 (from 2 to 3).
   - `n` must be such that `3 < n // 2`, which means `n` must be greater than 6.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1, `i` is 3, `pattern` contains 'A' and 'B', `n` must be greater than 6**
