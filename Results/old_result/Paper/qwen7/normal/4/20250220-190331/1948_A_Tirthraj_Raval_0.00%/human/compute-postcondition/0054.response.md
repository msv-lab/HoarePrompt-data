Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `n` as the variables involved in the loop condition.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in `range(n // 2)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < n // 2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `pattern` contains 'A' and 'B'.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body increments `i` by 1).
   - Therefore, `i` will become 3.
   - The value of `n` must be such that `i < n // 2` still holds true. Given `i` is now 3, `n // 2` must be greater than or equal to 3, meaning `n` must be at least 6.

5. **Final state**:
   - `t` remains greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1.
   - `i` is now 3.
   - `pattern` still contains 'A' and 'B'.
   - `n` must be at least 6.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1, `i` is 3, `pattern` contains 'A' and 'B', `n` must be at least 6**.
