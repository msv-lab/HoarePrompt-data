Reasoning:
- The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
- It correctly identifies whether `n` is odd or even.
- If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO', which is correct since an odd number cannot be split into pairs where each character has exactly one neighbor of a different type.
- If `n` is even, it constructs a pattern of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters of length `n`, which ensures that every character (except the first and last) will have exactly one neighbor of a different type, making them special. This pattern is then printed.
- The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to handle all cases correctly according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
