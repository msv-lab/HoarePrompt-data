Reasoning:
- The problem requires constructing a string with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- The provided solution correctly identifies that if `n` is odd, it is impossible to have exactly `n` special characters because the total number of special characters in any alternating pattern will always be even.
- For even `n`, the solution generates a pattern of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, which indeed has exactly `n` special characters. This is because each pair of adjacent characters ('A', 'B') or ('B', 'A') contributes exactly one special character.
- The generated pattern is of length `n`, which is at most 50 (as per the constraints), fitting within the allowed length of 200 characters.
- The solution handles all test cases as described in the problem statement and produces the correct output for both scenarios (when `n` is odd and when `n` is even).

Correctness: **True**
