Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly generate a string with exactly `n` special characters. According to the problem statement, a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The current implementation does not ensure that the generated string will have exactly `n` special characters. For example, when `n=6`, the output "AAABAACC" has 6 special characters, but for other values of `n`, it may not produce the correct number of special characters. Additionally, the logic for generating the pattern does not always result in a string where each character is special.
