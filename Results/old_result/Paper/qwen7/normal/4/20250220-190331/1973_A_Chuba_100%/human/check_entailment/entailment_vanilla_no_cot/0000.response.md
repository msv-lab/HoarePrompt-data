Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened. The logic in the function `func` is flawed. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Checking for Odd Sum**: The condition `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1` checks if the total points are odd. However, this alone does not guarantee that the scores are inconsistent; it only indicates that the sum of points must be even for the scores to be achievable.

2. **Calculating Maximum Draws**: The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is incorrect. The current approach does not account for the constraints and relationships between the players' scores accurately.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Check Consistency**: Ensure that the total points are even and that the scores can be achieved through a combination of wins and draws.
2. **Calculate Maximum Draws**: Use the scores to determine the maximum possible number of draws.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Check if the total points are even
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the minimum points needed for the first player to win or draw
        min_points_needed = 2 * p1 - (p3 - p2)
        
        # Calculate the maximum possible draws
        max_draws = (p3 - min_points_needed) // 2
        
        # Ensure the calculated draws do not exceed the possible draws from the remaining points
        if max_draws > (p2 - p1) + (p3 - p2):
            max_draws = (p2 - p1) + (p3 - p2)
        
        print(max_draws)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the scores are checked for consistency and calculates the maximum number of draws correctly.
