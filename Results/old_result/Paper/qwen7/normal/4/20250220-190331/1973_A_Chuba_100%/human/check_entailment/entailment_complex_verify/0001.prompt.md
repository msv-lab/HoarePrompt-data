You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)
        
    #State: t is 0, and for each iteration i (where 0 ≤ i < t), `v[i]` is a list of integers entered by the user, and `result[i]` is calculated as `(v[i][0] + v[i][1] + v[i][2] - max(0, v[i][2] - v[i][0] - v[i][1])) // 2` if the sum of the first three elements of `v[i]` is even. If the sum is odd, `-1` is printed instead.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `t` and then processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it takes three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` as input. It calculates a result based on the sum of these three integers. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`. If the sum is even, it calculates the result as `(p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)) // 2` and prints this value. After processing all test cases, the function ends.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers representing the scores of the three players: `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Parity:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even.
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because an odd total score cannot be achieved through the scoring rules (each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points in total).

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(p1 + p2 + p3 - \max(0, p3 - p1 - p2))}{2}
     \]
   - This formula aims to find the maximum number of draws by subtracting the minimum possible points from the total points and then dividing by 2.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Formula for Maximum Draws:**
   - The formula used in the program does not correctly account for the constraints and possibilities of the scoring system.
   - Specifically, the term `max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)` is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. The correct approach should consider the distribution of wins and draws more carefully.

2. **Handling of Scores:**
   - The program does not properly handle the distribution of wins and draws to ensure the scores are achievable.
   - The formula used might not always yield the correct maximum number of draws.

### Example Analysis:

- **Example 1:** `0 0 0`
  - Sum: `0 + 0 + 0 = 0` (even)
  - Result: `0 / 2 = 0` (correct)

- **Example 2:** `0 1 1`
  - Sum: `0 + 1 + 1 = 2` (even)
  - Result: `2 - 0 = 2` (should be 1, not 2)

- **Example 3:** `1 1 1`
  - Sum: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` (odd)
  - Result: `-1` (correct)

- **Example 4:** `1 1 2`
  - Sum: `1 + 1 + 2 = 4` (even)
  - Result: `4 - 1 = 3` (should be 2, not 3)

- **Example 5:** `3 3 3`
  - Sum: `3 + 3 + 3 = 9` (odd)
  - Result: `-1` (correct)

- **Example 6:** `3 4 5`
  - Sum: `3 + 4 + 5 = 12` (even)
  - Result: `12 - 2 = 10` (should be 6, not 10)

- **Example 7:** `1 1 10`
  - Sum: `1 + 1 + 10 = 12` (even)
  - Result: `12 - 8 = 4` (should be 2, not 4)

### Conclusion:

The provided program has logical errors in calculating the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the program is not correct.
