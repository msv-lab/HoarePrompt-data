Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The variables involved here are `_` (a dummy variable) and `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: According to the problem statement, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is a positive integer, it will always be greater than 0 when the loop starts.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing. Given that `t` is assigned the value of an input, we need to confirm that the input is within the specified range. However, since the problem guarantees that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, we don't need to change anything about `t` itself. The only thing we need to ensure is that the loop can start, which means `t` should be a valid positive integer.

Since the problem guarantees that `t` is a valid positive integer, we don't need to make any adjustments to the state other than confirming that `t` is a valid positive integer.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)**

This ensures that the loop can start executing.
