Postcondition: `v` is a list of integers entered by the user. If the sum of the first three elements of `v` is odd, the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition. If the sum of the first three elements of `v` is even, then `result` is calculated as `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.
