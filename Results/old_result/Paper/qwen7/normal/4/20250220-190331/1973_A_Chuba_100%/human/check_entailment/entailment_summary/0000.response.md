Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the sum of the scores (`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`) is even. If the sum is odd, it correctly prints `-1` because an odd sum cannot be achieved through the described scoring system (where each win contributes 2 points to one player and 0 to the other, and each draw contributes 1 point to each player).

However, the calculation of the result when the sum is even has a flaw. The formula used in the program:
```python
result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[1] - v[0])) // 2
```
is not correct for determining the maximum number of draws. This formula does not account for the fact that the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores must be even for the scores to be achievable through a combination of wins and draws.

A more accurate approach would involve checking if the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores is even, and then calculating the maximum number of draws accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        total_points = v[0] + v[1] + v[2]
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print('-1')
        elif v[2] - v[0] - v[1] < 0:
            print('-1')
        else:
            # Calculate the maximum number of draws
            max_draws = (total_points - 2 * v[0]) // 2
            if max_draws >= v[2] - v[0] - v[1]:
                print(max_draws)
            else:
                print(v[2] - v[0] - v[1])
```

This corrected version checks if the total points are even and if the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores is non-negative. It then calculates the maximum number of draws correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
