Output State: **`b[j]` is a '*', `b[j + 1]` is a '*', `b[:j+1]` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where `b[j]` and `b[j + 1]` were being checked, and `b[:j+1]` was being set to `False`. The values of `b[j]` and `b[j + 1]` remain unchanged, and the condition `b[:j+1]` is still `False`.
