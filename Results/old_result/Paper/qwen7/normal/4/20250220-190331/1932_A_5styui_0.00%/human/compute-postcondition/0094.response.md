Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(a):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` is a non-empty string.
   - `s` is 0.
   - `i` is `i_final + len(b)`.
   - `d` is an input integer.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `j` is `len(b)`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < a`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i_final + len(b)`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `a`.
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - Since `a` remains unchanged, it stays the same.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` becomes `i_final + len(b) + 1`.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - All other variables (`b`, `s`, `d`, `j`) remain the same.

**Final State**:
State: **`b` is a non-empty string, `s` is 0, `i` is `i_final + len(b) + 1`, `d` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, and `j` is `len(b)`**
