Postcondition: `b` is a non-empty string, `s` is an integer, and `j` is incremented by 1. If the character at index `j` in `b` is '@', the function continues with the next step where `j` remains as `j + 1`. If the character at index `j` in `b` is either empty or '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `j` remains as `j + 1` and no other changes occur.
