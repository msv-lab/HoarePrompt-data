Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `data` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `data = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the resulting list in the variable `data`. The initial conditions for `times` and `n` remain unchanged.
