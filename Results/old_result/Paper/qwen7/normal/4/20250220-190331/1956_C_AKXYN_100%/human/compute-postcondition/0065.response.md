Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State: `i` is 1, `n` is 2.
2. The code snippet is: `print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))`.

Let's break it down:

- `'2 %d' % i`: Here, `i` is 1. So, the string becomes `'2 %d' % 1`, which evaluates to `'2 1'` because `%d` is a placeholder for an integer, and it gets replaced by the value of `i` (which is 1).
  
- `*range(1, n + 1)`: The range function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n + 1 - 1`, which is 2 in this case. So, `range(1, 2 + 1)` generates `[1, 2]`. The `*` operator unpacks this list into separate arguments for the `print` function.

Putting it all together, the `print` statement will print the string `'2 1'` followed by the numbers 1 and 2, separated by spaces.

Output: **2 1 1 2**
