Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is the input value, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Understand the Input:**
   - The input is an integer `t`, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`.
   - This integer `t` will determine the number of iterations of the loop.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop will run `t` times, the input `t` must be within the specified range.
   - The initial state of `t` is given as an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`.

4. **Formulate the State:**
   - We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `t` must be within the valid range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `t`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500**
