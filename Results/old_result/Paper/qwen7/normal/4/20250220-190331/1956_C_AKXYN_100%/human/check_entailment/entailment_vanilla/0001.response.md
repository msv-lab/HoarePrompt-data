Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in an \(n \times n\) matrix using at most \(2n\) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
2. **Matrix Initialization**: The given program initializes the matrix `mat` such that each row is a permutation of integers from 1 to \(n\). This is done correctly using `list(range(1, n + 1))` for each row.
3. **Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the sum of the matrix elements. The formula used is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1)\), which simplifies to \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} (2i^2 + 3i + 1)\). This is derived from the fact that each element \(a_{i,j}\) will eventually be set to a value from 1 to \(n\), and the sum of all elements in the matrix will be the sum of all integers from 1 to \(n^2\).
4. **Operations Execution**: The program prints the required number of operations (which is \(2n\)) to achieve the maximum sum. It performs \(n\) row operations and \(n\) column operations, each setting the elements to a permutation of integers from 1 to \(n\).
5. **Output Format**: The program outputs the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the details of each operation. The format matches the requirements of the problem.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
