Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`, and the range function parameters.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n` down to 1 in steps of -1. This means `i` starts at `n` and decrements until it reaches 0.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The problem states that `i` is initially set to `n`.

4. **Determine the value of `n`**: The problem states that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

5. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop starts with `i` set to `n`, and `n` must be at least 3, we need to ensure these conditions are met.

6. **List the necessary adjustments**: We need to ensure that `i` is initialized to `n` and `n` is at least 3.

Given this analysis, the necessary adjustments are:

- `i` should be initialized to `n`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

Since `res`, `t`, and `mat` are not involved in the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
