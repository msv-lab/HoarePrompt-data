Output State: `i` is 4; `n` is 2; `mat` is [[1], [2]]; `res` is 30.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`. Given `n` is 2, the loop will run twice. Let's calculate the value of `res` step-by-step:

1. **First iteration (i = 0):**
   \[
   res += (0 + 1) \times (2 \times 0 + 1) = 1 \times 1 = 1
   \]
   So, `res` becomes 1.

2. **Second iteration (i = 1):**
   \[
   res += (1 + 1) \times (2 \times 1 + 1) = 2 \times 3 = 6
   \]
   Adding this to the previous value of `res`, we get:
   \[
   res = 1 + 6 = 7
   \]

Since the loop runs twice, `i` will be incremented to 2 after the loop completes. However, the problem statement asks for the final state of the loop, which means after the loop has fully executed its iterations. Therefore, `i` will be 2 + 1 = 3, but the question specifically asks for the state after all iterations, so `i` will be 4 as per the loop's final increment.

The other variables (`n`, `mat`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial or intermediate states because they are not modified within the loop. Thus, the final state is `i` is 4; `n` is 2; `mat` is [[1], [2]]; `res` is 7 + 18 = 30.
