Output State: `res` is 204, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 9, `i` is 9.

To calculate this, we observe the pattern in the loop. The loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it adds \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\) to `res`. After 3 iterations, `res` is 28. We can generalize the formula for the sum after `n` iterations as follows:

\[ \text{res} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) \]

For `n = 9`:

\[ \text{res} = (0+1) * (2*0+1) + (1+1) * (2*1+1) + (2+1) * (2*2+1) + (3+1) * (2*3+1) + (4+1) * (2*4+1) + (5+1) * (2*5+1) + (6+1) * (2*6+1) + (7+1) * (2*7+1) + (8+1) * (2*8+1) \]
\[ = 1 * 1 + 2 * 3 + 3 * 5 + 4 * 7 + 5 * 9 + 6 * 11 + 7 * 13 + 8 * 15 + 9 * 17 \]
\[ = 1 + 6 + 15 + 28 + 45 + 66 + 91 + 120 + 153 \]
\[ = 204 \]

Thus, after all iterations, `res` will be 204, assuming `n` is greater than 9.
