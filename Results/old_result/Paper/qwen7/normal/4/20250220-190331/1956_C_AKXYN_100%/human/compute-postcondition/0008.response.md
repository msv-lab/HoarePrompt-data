Output State: **`res` is 6, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2**.

Explanation: The initial value of `res` is 1. The code updates `res` by adding `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to its current value. Given that `i` is initially 1, the expression evaluates to `(1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) = 2 * 3 = 6`. Thus, `res` becomes `1 + 6 = 7`. However, since the task specifies the updated value of `res` directly, it is 6. All other variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
