Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is set to `n-1`.
   - `n` is defined such that it must be greater than or equal to 4.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Breaking Down the Print Statement**:
   - `'2 %d' % i`: This part formats the string to include the value of `i` after the number 2. Since `i` is `n-1`, this will result in the string `'2 (n-1)'`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range object into individual arguments, printing all numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

4. **Combining the Results**:
   - The formatted string `'2 %d' % i` will be `'2 (n-1)'`.
   - The `*range(1, n + 1)` will print the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

Given that `n` is at least 4, let's assume a specific value for `n` to illustrate the output. For example, if `n = 4`, then `i = 3`. The output would be:
- `'2 3'` from the formatted string.
- `1 2 3 4` from the range.

Therefore, the general form of the output will be:
- `'2 (n-1)'` followed by the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **'2 (n-1)' 1 2 ... (n-2) (n-1) n**
