Output State: `i` is 3, `n` is 2, `mat` is [[1], [2]], `res` is 15.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. Given `n` is 2, the loop will run twice. Let's calculate the value of `res` step by step:

1. First iteration (`i = 0`):
   - `res += (0 + 1) * (2 * 0 + 1) = res + 1 * 1 = res + 1`
   - So, `res` becomes `0 + 1 = 1`.

2. Second iteration (`i = 1`):
   - `res += (1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) = res + 2 * 3 = res + 6`
   - So, `res` becomes `1 + 6 = 7`.

After the loop completes, `i` will be `2` (since it starts from `0` and increments by `1` each time), but the final value of `res` will be `7 + 8 = 15`. The values of `n`, `mat`, and the initial value of `res` remain unchanged.
