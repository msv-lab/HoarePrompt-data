Output State: **`res` is 16, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`**.

Explanation: The value of `res` was initially 2. The code updates `res` by adding the value of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to it. Given that `i` is 3, we calculate `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` as follows: `(3 + 1) * (2 * 3 + 1) = 4 * 7 = 28`. Therefore, `res` becomes `2 + 28 = 30`. However, since the exact value of `t` and the structure of `mat` are not affected by the code, they remain as stated in the initial state.
