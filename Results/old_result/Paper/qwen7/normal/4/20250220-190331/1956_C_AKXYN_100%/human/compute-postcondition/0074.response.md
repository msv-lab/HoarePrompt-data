Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and an integer `n`. For each test case, it initializes a square matrix `mat` of size `n x n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`. It then calculates a result `res` using a specific formula involving `i` and prints this result along with `2 * n`. The function also prints a sequence of commands involving the matrix `mat` for each value of `n` from `n` down to 1. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.**
