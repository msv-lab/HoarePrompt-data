Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The loop starts with `i` equal to `n` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches 1. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, `i` is now `n-2`. Since the loop continues as long as `i` is greater than 0 and `n` must be at least 3, when `i` becomes 1, the loop will stop. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be 1, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3.
