Output State: `i` is 0; `n` is 2; `mat` is [[1], [2]]; `res` is 30.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = n` down to `i = 1`. Given `n` is 2, the loop will run twice. Let's calculate the value of `res` step-by-step based on the provided operations:

1. **First iteration (i = 2):**
   \[
   res += (2 + 1) \times (2 \times 2 + 1) = 3 \times 5 = 15
   \]
   So, `res` becomes 15.

2. **Second iteration (i = 1):**
   \[
   res += (1 + 1) \times (2 \times 1 + 1) = 2 \times 3 = 6
   \]
   Adding this to the previous value of `res`, we get:
   \[
   res = 15 + 6 = 21
   \]

After the loop completes, `i` will be decremented to 0. The variables `n`, `mat`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial or intermediate states because they are not modified within the loop. Therefore, the final state is `i` is 0; `n` is 2; `mat` is [[1], [2]]; `res` is 21 + 9 = 30.
