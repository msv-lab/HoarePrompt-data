Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
    diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])
    if diff1 > diff2:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))
    else:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is a list containing one tuple either `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2` is true or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1 > diff2` is false, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element in the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the first element in list `a` and the first element in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the first element in list `a` and the last element in list `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `i` is the next element in the list `a`, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is a list containing one tuple either `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2` is true or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1 > diff2` is false, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `i` is the next element in the list `a`, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is a list containing tuples where the first element is either `-diff1` or `-diff2` depending on whether `diff1 > diff2` is true or false, the second element is `i`, and the third element is either `0` or `m - 1`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
