Output State: **`ans` remains 0, `max_heap` does not contain `item`, `item` is the smallest element from `max_heap` before it was removed.**

Explanation: The code `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` pops and returns the smallest element from the `max_heap`. After the operation, `max_heap` no longer contains this `item`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged at 0.
