Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0]; `tp1` is increased by 1**.

The code increments `tp1` by 1, but the initial state of `ans` being increased by `-item[0]` remains unchanged. Therefore, `ans` retains its previous value plus the contribution from `-item[0]`, and `tp1` is now one more than its previous value.
