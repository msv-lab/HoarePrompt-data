Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads integers t, n, m, a_i, and b_i. It then calculates the minimum total difference between elements of array a and elements of array b by strategically pairing elements from b with those from a. The function returns the cumulative sum of these minimum differences for all test cases.**
