Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` and `m` are the first and second integers entered respectively, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is not empty, `item` is the highest value element that was popped from `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by the negative of `item[0]`, `item` is no longer in `max_heap`, `tp1` is incremented by 1, `tp2` is decremented by 2 if `item[2]` is greater than `tp2`.**

In this output state, `tp1` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
