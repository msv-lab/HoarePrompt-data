Output State: **`tp1` is incremented by 1, `ans` is `diff1`, `max_heap` does not contain `item`, `item` is the smallest element from `max_heap` before it was removed, `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`**.

Explanation: The code `ans += diff1` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `diff1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, and `tp1` is incremented by 1, the updated value of `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `diff1`. The other conditions and values of the variables remain as they were in the initial state.
