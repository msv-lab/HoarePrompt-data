Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b.sort()
    max_heap = []
    tp1 = 0
    tp2 = m - 1
    ans = 0
    for i in a:
        diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
        diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))
        else:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))
    while max_heap:
        item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
            diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
            diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
            if diff1 > diff2:
                tp1 += 1
                ans += diff1
            else:
                tp2 -= 1
                ans += diff2
        else:
            ans += -item[0]
            if item[2] == tp1:
                tp1 += 1
            else:
                tp2 -= 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is equal to `m - 1`, `tp2` is equal to 0, and `ans` is the sum of the differences calculated during each iteration of the loop as described.

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have been executed, `max_heap` contains no elements since it gets emptied out during the loop. The variables `tp1` and `tp2` are set to their respective boundary values (`m - 1` and 0) and do not change further. The variable `ans` holds the cumulative sum of the differences calculated for each element in list `a` according to the conditions specified in the loop body.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: After all iterations of the loop, `ans` will be the sum of the adjustments made during each iteration, and `max_heap` will be empty.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `ans` will be the sum of its initial value (0) and all the maximum differences found during the iterations, `diff1` and `diff2` will be the final absolute differences calculated in the last iteration, and `max_heap` will be empty.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
