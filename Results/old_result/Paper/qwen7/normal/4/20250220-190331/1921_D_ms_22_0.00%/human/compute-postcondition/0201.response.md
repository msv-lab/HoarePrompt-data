Output State: **`b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `max_heap` is an empty list, `t` is greater than 0 - 1, `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0.**

The code initializes `tp1` to 0. Since `b`, `a`, `n`, `m`, `max_heap`, `t`, and `ans` were already defined with their respective values or conditions, they remain unchanged. Therefore, the only new information is that `tp1` is now set to 0.
