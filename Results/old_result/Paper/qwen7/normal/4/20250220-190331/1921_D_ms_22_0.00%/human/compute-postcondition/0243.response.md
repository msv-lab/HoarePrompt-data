Output State: **`ans` is still 0, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is now the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the last element of `b`; `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before popping; `tp2` is decreased by 1.**

This output state reflects that `tp2` has been decremented by 1 while all other variables retain their previous conditions.
