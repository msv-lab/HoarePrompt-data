Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was popped; `ans` is increased by either `diff1` (if `diff1` is greater than `diff2` and `item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2`) or `diff2` (if `diff2` is greater than or equal to `diff1` and `item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2`); if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `ans` is increased by `-item[0]` and `tp2` is decremented by 1 if `item[2]` is greater than `tp2`.
