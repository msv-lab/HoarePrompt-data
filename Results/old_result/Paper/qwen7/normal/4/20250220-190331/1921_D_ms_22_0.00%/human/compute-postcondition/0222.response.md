Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` which is iterating over the list `a`.

2. **Determine the Initial State Before the Loop Starts**: The initial state before the loop starts is not explicitly given, but we know the postcondition after the if-else block. This means that the loop has just started and `i` is about to take its first value from the list `a`.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: Since the loop is about to execute for the first time, the state will change as follows:
   - `i` will take the first value from the list `a`.
   - `next_i` (which was used in the if-else condition) will now refer to the next element in the list `a`.
   - The `max_heap` will be updated based on the new values of `i` and `next_i`.

Given the postcondition after the if-else block, we can infer that the `max_heap` will contain either `(-diff1, next_i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, depending on the comparison between `diff1` and `diff2`. However, since the loop is starting, we don't yet know which of these conditions will be true. Therefore, we will consider both possibilities.

4. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `ans` remains 0.
   - `diff1` and `diff2` retain their original values.
   - `max_heap` will contain either `(-diff1, next_i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`.

Since the loop is starting, `i` will be the first element of the list `a`, and `next_i` will be the second element of the list `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the first iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(next_i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `max_heap` contains either `(-diff1, next_i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, where `i` is the first element of `a` and `next_i` is the second element of `a`**.
