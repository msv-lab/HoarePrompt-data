The only variable in the loop head is `max_heap`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `max_heap`. For the loop to execute at least once, `max_heap` must not be empty.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99
- `n` is the first integer entered
- `m` is the second integer entered
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer
- `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`
- `max_heap` is a list containing tuples where the first element is either `-diff1` or `-diff2` depending on whether `diff1 > diff2` is true or false, the second element is each `i` from the list `a`, and the third element is either `0` or `m - 1`
- `tp1` is 0
- `tp2` is `m - 1`
- `ans` is 0

For the loop to execute the first time, `max_heap` must not be empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `max_heap` is non-empty.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is non-empty, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0**
