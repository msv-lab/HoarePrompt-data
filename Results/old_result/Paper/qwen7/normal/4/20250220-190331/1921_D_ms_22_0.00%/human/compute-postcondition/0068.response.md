Output State: **`ans` is increased by the negative of the highest value element that was popped from `max_heap`, `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is empty, `item` is the highest value element that was popped from `max_heap`.**

In this case, the code `ans += -item[0]` updates the variable `ans` by adding the negative of the highest value element that was popped from `max_heap`. Since `max_heap` is initially empty, no elements have been popped yet, so `item` remains undefined, but the structure of the variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
