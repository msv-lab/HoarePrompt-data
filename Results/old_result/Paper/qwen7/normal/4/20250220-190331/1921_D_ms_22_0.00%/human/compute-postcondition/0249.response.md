Output State: **`ans` is now -item[0], `diff1` and `diff2` will hold the absolute differences between the last processed element `i` and the first and last elements of list `b` respectively, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before popping. `item[2]` is within the range of `tp1` and `tp2`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `-item[0]` to its current value, which is 0. Therefore, `ans` becomes `-item[0]`. The values of `diff1`, `diff2`, `item`, and the condition regarding `item[2]` remain unchanged from the initial state.
