Postcondition: `ans` remains 0, `max_heap` does not contain `item`, `item` is the smallest element from `max_heap` before it was removed, `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is set to `diff1`. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `diff2` and `tp2` is decremented by 1.
