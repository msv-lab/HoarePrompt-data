Output State: **`tp2` is decremented by 1, `tp1` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by either the negative of `item[1]` plus the minimum of `diff1` and `diff2`, or simply the negative of `item[1]` depending on whether `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `item` is no longer in `max_heap`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1] + 1`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`.**

Explanation: The line `tp2 -= 1` decrements the value of `tp2` by 1. All other variables remain in their previous states. The conditions for updating `ans` and the values of `diff1` and `diff2` remain the same as before the decrement.
