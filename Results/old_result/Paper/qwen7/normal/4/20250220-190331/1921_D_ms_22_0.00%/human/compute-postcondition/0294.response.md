Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` will be the sum of its initial value (0) and all the maximum differences found during the iterations.
- `diff1` and `diff2` will be the final absolute differences calculated in the last iteration.
- `max_heap` will be empty.

Since `max_heap` is empty, it does not contribute to the value of `ans`. The value of `ans` is solely determined by the sum of its initial value (0) and all the maximum differences found during the iterations. Given that no specific iterations or maximum differences are mentioned, we assume that no such differences have been added to `ans`.

Therefore, the value of `ans` remains 0.

Output: **0**
