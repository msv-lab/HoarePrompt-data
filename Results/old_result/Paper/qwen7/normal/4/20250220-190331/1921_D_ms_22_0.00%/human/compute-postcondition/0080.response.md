Output State: **`tp1` is incremented by 1, `tp2` remains the same, `diff1` is recalculated as the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1] + 1`, `diff2` is recalculated as the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, `ans` is increased by `diff1`, `item` is no longer in `max_heap`, `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` and `m` are the first and second integers entered respectively, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is not empty.**

Explanation: The code `ans += diff1` adds the value of `diff1` to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
