Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is non-empty (but now the top item has been popped), `tp1` is `m`, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `-item[0]`, and `(item[2] == tp1)`**

Explanation: The line `tp1 += 1` increments the value of `tp1` by 1. Since `tp1` was initially set to `m - 1`, after executing this line, `tp1` becomes `m`. All other variables remain unchanged.
