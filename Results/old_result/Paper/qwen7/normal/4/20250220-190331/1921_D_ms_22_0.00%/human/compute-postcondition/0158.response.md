To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head, which is `max_heap`.

The loop condition `while max_heap:` means the loop will continue as long as `max_heap` is not empty.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has processed an element from `max_heap`. For the loop to execute one more time, `max_heap` must still contain elements.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `max_heap` to ensure it is not empty.

State: **`max_heap` is not empty**
