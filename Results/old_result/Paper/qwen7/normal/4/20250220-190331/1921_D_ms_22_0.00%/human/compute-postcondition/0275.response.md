Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`; `ans` is increased by either `diff1` or `diff2` if `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `ans` is increased by `-item[0] - 1`.
