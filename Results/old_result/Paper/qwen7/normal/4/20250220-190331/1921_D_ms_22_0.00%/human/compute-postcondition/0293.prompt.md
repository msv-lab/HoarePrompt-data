Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `ans` is still 0, `diff1` and `diff2` will hold the absolute differences between the last processed element `i` and the first and last elements of list `b` respectively, and `max_heap` will contain tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` where `index` is either 0 (indicating comparison with `b[0]`) or `m-1` (indicating comparison with `b[m-1]`), depending on which difference was larger during each iteration. The heap will include all such tuples from each iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `ans` will still be 0, `diff1` and `diff2` will store the final absolute differences calculated in the last iteration, and `max_heap` will contain a collection of tuples representing the largest differences found in each iteration, along with the indices used for those comparisons.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` is either the sum of its original value (0) and the maximum of `diff1` and `diff2`, or `-item[0]`. `diff1` and `diff2` remain the absolute differences between the second element of `item` and the first and last elements of list `b`, respectively. `tp1` and `tp2` are updated as follows: if `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then `ans` is updated to be the sum of `ans` and the maximum of `diff1` and `diff2`. Additionally, `tp2` is decreased by 1. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is set to `item[2] + 1` and `tp2` remains unchanged. If neither condition is met, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `tp1` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`; `ans` is increased by either `diff1` or `diff2` if `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `ans` is increased by `-item[0] - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was popped; `ans` is increased by either `diff1` (if `diff1` is greater than `diff2` and `item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2`) or `diff2` (if `diff2` is greater than or equal to `diff1` and `item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2`); if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `ans` is increased by `-item[0]` and `tp2` is decremented by 1 if `item[2]` is greater than `tp2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
