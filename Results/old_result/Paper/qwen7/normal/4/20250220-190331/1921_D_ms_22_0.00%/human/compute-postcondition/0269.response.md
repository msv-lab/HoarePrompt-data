Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0], `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by `-item[0]`. Since `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `-item[0]` represents the negative of the highest value in `max_heap`. The state of `max_heap` is updated to not contain the item that was popped, and `ans` is updated accordingly.
