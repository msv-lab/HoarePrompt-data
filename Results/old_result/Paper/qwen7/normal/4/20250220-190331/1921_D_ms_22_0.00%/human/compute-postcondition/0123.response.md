Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is the next element in the list `a`, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `max_heap` contains either `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` depending on whether `diff1` is greater than `diff2` or not.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `diff2` to be `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `diff2` was previously defined as `abs(new_i - b[m - 1])`, and now it is updated to `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, the comparison between `diff1` and `diff2` might change, but the structure of `max_heap` will reflect the current values of `diff1` and `diff2` with `i` as the second element in the tuple.
