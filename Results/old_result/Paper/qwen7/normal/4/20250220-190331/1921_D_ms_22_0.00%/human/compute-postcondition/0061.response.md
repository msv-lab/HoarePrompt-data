Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is empty, `item` is the highest value element that was popped from `max_heap`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`**

Explanation: The code calculates `diff2` as the absolute difference between `item[1]` (which is the second element of the `item` tuple, the highest value element popped from `max_heap`) and `b[tp2]` (an element from the sorted list `b`). However, since `max_heap` is empty and no elements have been popped, `item` does not have a specific value yet. Therefore, `diff2` also does not have a specific value. All other variables remain unchanged.
