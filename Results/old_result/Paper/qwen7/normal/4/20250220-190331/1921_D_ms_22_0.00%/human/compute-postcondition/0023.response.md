Output State: **`diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `i` is the next element in the list `a`, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is a list containing tuples where one tuple is `(-diff1, i, 0)` pushed into the heap, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.**

The code `heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))` pushes a new tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` into the `max_heap`. The other variables remain unchanged.
