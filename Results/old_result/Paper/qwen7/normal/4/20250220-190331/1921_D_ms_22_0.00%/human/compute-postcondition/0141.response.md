Output State: **`ans` remains 0, `max_heap` does not contain `item`, `item` is the smallest element from `max_heap` before it was removed, `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, `tp2` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `tp2 -= 1` decrements the value of `tp2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given conditions.
