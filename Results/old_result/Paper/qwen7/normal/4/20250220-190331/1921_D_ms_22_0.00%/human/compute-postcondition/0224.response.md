Output State: **`ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `max_heap` contains either `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `diff2` to be `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. Since `diff1` and `ans` are not affected by this line of code, their values remain the same. The value of `max_heap` changes from `(-diff1, next_i, 0)` to `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` because `diff2` is updated to `abs(i - b[m - 1])`.
