Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0] - 1, `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped.**

Explanation: The variable `tp2` is decremented by 1, so the change to `ans` remains the same as it was initially increased by `-item[0]`. The value of `max_heap` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it.
