Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is updated to a new list of integers obtained from the input split and converted, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is equal to `m - 1`, `tp2` is equal to 0, and `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `b`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
