Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0], `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the negative value of `item[0]`. Since `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed, `item[0]` represents the highest value in the heap. After removing this item, the `max_heap` no longer contains this item. The value of `ans` is updated accordingly, but the state of `max_heap` is altered by the removal of the highest value item.
