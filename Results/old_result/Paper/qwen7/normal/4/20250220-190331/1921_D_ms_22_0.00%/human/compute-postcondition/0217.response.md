Output State: **`ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(next_i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `max_heap` contains either `(-diff1, next_i, 0)` or `(-diff2, next_i, m - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `diff2` to `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. The other variables (`ans`, `diff1`, `max_heap`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
