Output State: **`ans` remains 0, `max_heap` does not contain `item`, `item` is the smallest element from `max_heap` before it was removed, `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`.**

The code calculates the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` and assigns it to `diff1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
