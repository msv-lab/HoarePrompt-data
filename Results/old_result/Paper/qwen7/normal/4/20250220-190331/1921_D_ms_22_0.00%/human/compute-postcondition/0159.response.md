Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`.**

Explanation: The code `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` removes and returns the item with the highest value from `max_heap`. After this operation, `max_heap` no longer contains this item. The variable `item` is assigned the value of the popped item.
