Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is sorted in ascending order, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is equal to 0, `tp2` is equal to `m - 1`, and `ans` is 0.**

The code `tp2 = m - 1` assigns the value of `m - 1` to `tp2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
