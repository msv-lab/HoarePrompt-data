Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop condition is `t > 0`. This means that for the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**: According to the given state, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since `t` is already within the range of 1 to 100, it satisfies the condition `t > 0`. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for `t`.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop remains the same as the current state provided.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100**
