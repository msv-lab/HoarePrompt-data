### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and processes each test case one by one.
2. **Variable Initialization**: It initializes `start_year` to 0, which is used to track the current year.
3. **Loop Through Signs**: For each test case, it iterates through the list of periodicities (`nums`).
4. **Year Calculation**: In the loop, it updates `start_year` using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This formula aims to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`.
5. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, it prints the final `start_year`.

Let's analyze the logic step-by-step with an example from the problem statement:

- For the first test case: `[3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - Start with `start_year = 0`.
  - First sign: `3` -> Next multiple of 3 after 0 is 3.
  - Second sign: `2` -> Next multiple of 2 after 3 is 4.
  - Third sign: `4` -> Next multiple of 4 after 4 is 8.
  - Fourth sign: `5` -> Next multiple of 5 after 8 is 10.
  - Fifth sign: `9` -> Next multiple of 9 after 10 is 18.
  - Sixth sign: `18` -> Next multiple of 18 after 18 is 36.

This matches the expected output of 36.

However, let's consider another example to ensure the logic is sound:

- For the second test case: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - Start with `start_year = 0`.
  - First sign: `1` -> Next multiple of 1 after 0 is 1.
  - Second sign: `2` -> Next multiple of 2 after 1 is 2.
  - Third sign: `3` -> Next multiple of 3 after 2 is 3.
  - Fourth sign: `4` -> Next multiple of 4 after 3 is 4.
  - Fifth sign: `5` -> Next multiple of 5 after 4 is 5.

This also matches the expected output of 5.

Now, let's verify the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`:

- For the first iteration (`x = 0`), `start_year = 0`, `nums[0] = 3`:
  - `((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = (1 // 3 + 1) * 3 = (0 + 1) * 3 = 3`.
- For the second iteration (`x = 1`), `start_year = 3`, `nums[1] = 2`:
  - `((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = (4 // 2 + 1) * 2 = (2 + 1) * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6 - 2 = 4`.
- For the third iteration (`x = 2`), `start_year = 4`, `nums[2] = 4`:
  - `((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = (5 // 4 + 1) * 4 = (1 + 1) * 4 = 2 * 4 = 8`.
- For the fourth iteration (`x = 3`), `start_year = 8`, `nums[3] = 5`:
  - `((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = (9 // 5 + 1) * 5 = (1 + 1) * 5 = 2 * 5 = 10`.
- For the fifth iteration (`x = 4`), `start_year = 10`, `nums[4] = 9`:
  - `((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = (11 // 9 + 1) * 9 = (1 + 1) * 9 = 2 * 9 = 18`.
- For the sixth iteration (`x = 5`), `start_year = 18`, `nums[5] = 18`:
  - `((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = (19 // 18 + 1) * 18 = (1 + 1) * 18 = 2 * 18 = 36`.

The formula does not seem to be correctly calculating the next multiple. Instead, we should use the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities.

### Corrected Logic:

To find the next year when all signs occur, we need to compute the LCM of the periodicities. The LCM can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \]

We can extend this to multiple numbers using the same formula iteratively.

### Corrected Code:

```python
import math
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)

def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        result = reduce(lcm, nums)
        print(result)
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment was incorrect because the provided formula does not correctly calculate the next multiple of the periodicities. The corrected approach uses the least common multiple (LCM) to find the year when all signs will occur.

Final: **False**
