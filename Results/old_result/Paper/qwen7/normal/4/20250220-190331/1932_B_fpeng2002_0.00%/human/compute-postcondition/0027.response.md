Output State: `num_tests` is greater than -1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is updated to `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `x` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list minus one (i.e., `len(nums) - 1`). Therefore, the final update to `start_year` will be based on the last element of the `nums` list. The `start_year` will be updated to `(((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1])`. All other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, and `nums`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
