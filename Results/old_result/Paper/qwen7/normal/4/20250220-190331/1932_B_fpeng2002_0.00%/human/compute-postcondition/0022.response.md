Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `x` and it ranges from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num_tests` is greater than -1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element.
   - `start_year` is updated to `(((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x])`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `x` is less than `len(nums)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` would have been incremented by 1 if the loop continued.
   - Therefore, `x` will be `x + 1` in the next iteration.
   - `start_year` is updated based on the current value of `x` in each iteration. For the next iteration, `x` will be incremented, so the update will be based on `x + 1`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `num_tests` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `nums` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `start_year` will be updated based on `x + 1` in the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `x` is incremented by 1, so `x` will be `x + 1`.
- `start_year` will be updated based on `x + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`num_tests` is greater than -1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is updated to `(((start_year + 1) // nums[x + 1] + 1) * nums[x + 1])`**.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`num_tests` is greater than -1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is updated to `(((start_year + 1) // nums[x + 1] + 1) * nums[x + 1])`**.
