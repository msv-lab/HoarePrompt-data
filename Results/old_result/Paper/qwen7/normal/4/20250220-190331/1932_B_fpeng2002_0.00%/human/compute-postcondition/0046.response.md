Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then computes a value `start_year` using a specific formula that involves dividing and multiplying the elements of the list in reverse order, starting with an initial value of 0. After processing all test cases, the function prints the computed `start_year` values for each test case.**
