Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in range(0, len(nums)):`. The variables involved here are `x`, `len(nums)`, and the loop itself.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `x`: This variable is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
   - `len(nums)`: This is the length of the `nums` list, which is a constant value determined by the initial state of `nums`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `0 <= x < len(nums)` must be true.
   - Since `x` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `x` is less than `len(nums)`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - `x` should be set to 0 initially.
   - `len(nums)` should be the length of the `nums` list.
   - Ensure that `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `x` should be 0.
- `len(nums)` should be the length of the `nums` list.
- `nums` should be a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`x` is 0, `len(nums)` is the length of the `nums` list, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces**.
