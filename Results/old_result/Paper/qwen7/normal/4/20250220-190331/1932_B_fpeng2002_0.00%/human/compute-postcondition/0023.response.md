Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than -1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is updated to `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `start_year` to `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. The values of `num_tests`, `n`, and `nums` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `x` is not defined in the given context, so its value is unknown, but the formula for updating `start_year` is applied.
