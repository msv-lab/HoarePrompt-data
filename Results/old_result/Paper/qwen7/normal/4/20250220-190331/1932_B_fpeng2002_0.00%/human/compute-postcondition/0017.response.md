Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than -1, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `num_tests` is greater than -1 but less than or equal to 0. The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the input function waits for user input, the value of `num_tests` remains unchanged. Therefore, `num_tests` is still greater than -1. The variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer input provided by the user.
