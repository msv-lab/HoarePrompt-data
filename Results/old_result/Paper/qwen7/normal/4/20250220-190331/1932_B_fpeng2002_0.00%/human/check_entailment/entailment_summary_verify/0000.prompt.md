You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then computes a value `start_year` using a specific formula that involves dividing and multiplying the elements of the list in reverse order, starting with an initial value of 0. After processing all test cases, the function prints the computed `start_year` values for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. The logic in the loop where `start_year` is updated is flawed. Specifically, the expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` does not correctly compute the next occurrence of the sign.

For example, consider the input:
- Test case: 6
- Signs: 3 2 4 5 9 18

The correct sequence of years for the signs to occur would be:
1. First sign occurs in year 3.
2. Second sign occurs in year 4 (since the first sign occurred in year 3, we start from year 4).
3. Third sign occurs in year 8 (since the second sign occurred in year 4, we start from year 5 and the third sign occurs every 4 years).
4. Fourth sign occurs in year 10 (since the third sign occurred in year 8, we start from year 9 and the fourth sign occurs every 5 years).
5. Fifth sign occurs in year 18 (since the fourth sign occurred in year 10, we start from year 11 and the fifth sign occurs every 9 years).
6. Sixth sign occurs in year 36 (since the fifth sign occurred in year 18, we start from year 19 and the sixth sign occurs every 18 years).

However, the program incorrectly calculates the year for the sixth sign. Let's trace the calculation:
- Initial `start_year` is 0.
- For the first sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`.
- For the second sign: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 6`.
- For the third sign: `start_year = ((6 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 12`.
- For the fourth sign: `start_year = ((12 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 20`.
- For the fifth sign: `start_year = ((20 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 27`.
- For the sixth sign: `start_year = ((27 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`.

While this particular example seems to work, the logic is flawed and does not handle all cases correctly. For instance, consider the input:
- Test case: 5
- Signs: 1 2 3 4 5

The correct sequence of years would be:
1. First sign occurs in year 1.
2. Second sign occurs in year 2.
3. Third sign occurs in year 4.
4. Fourth sign occurs in year 8.
5. Fifth sign occurs in year 16.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the year for the fifth sign:
- Initial `start_year` is 0.
- For the first sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`.
- For the second sign: `start_year = ((1 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`.
- For the third sign: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 9`.
- For the fourth sign: `start_year = ((9 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 16`.
- For the fifth sign: `start_year = ((16 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 21`.

This shows that the program does not correctly compute the year for the fifth sign, indicating that the logic is flawed and the program is incorrect.
