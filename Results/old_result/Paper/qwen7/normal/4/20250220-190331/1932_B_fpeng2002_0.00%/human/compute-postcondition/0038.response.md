Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `x` is 1
- `start_year` is ((((start_year + 1) // nums[1]) + 1) * nums[1])

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for x in range(0, len(nums)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `x`:**
   - The loop starts from `0` and increments `x` by `1` each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is `1`.
   - For the next iteration, `x` needs to be `2`.

2. **Variable `start_year`:**
   - The value of `start_year` is defined based on the previous value of `start_year` and the value of `nums[1]`.
   - Since `x` is incremented by `1` in the loop, this variable does not change within the loop itself but is dependent on the loop condition.
   - The value of `start_year` remains the same for the next iteration unless the loop body changes it, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume `start_year` stays the same.

### Conclusion
- The only variable that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is `x`.
- `x` needs to be `2` for the next iteration.
- `start_year` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

### Updated State
State: **`x` is 2; `start_year` is ((((start_year + 1) // nums[1]) + 1) * nums[1])**
