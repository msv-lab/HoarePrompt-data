Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires assigning distinct integers to vertices such that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques, where a clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function calculates the number of cliques needed and calls `make_array` for each clique.
   - **make_array**: This function fills the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` based on the given parameters `left`, `right`, and `clique`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - The `make_array` function ensures that within each clique, the assigned integers are distinct and follow a specific pattern to satisfy the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).

4. **Verification**:
   - The code correctly initializes the number of cliques and calls `make_array` for each clique.
   - `make_array` correctly assigns values to `arr` and `cliquess` ensuring that the conditions for forming cliques are met.
   - The output format matches the required format: the assignment of integers, the number of cliques, and the partition of vertices into cliques.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
