Output State: The loop will execute `mid` times. After all iterations, the following conditions will hold:

- `i` will range from `0` to `mid - 1`.
- For each `i` in this range, `cliquess[left + i]` will be set to `clique`.
- `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` will be set to `small_element + i`.

In simpler terms, the `cliquess` array will be filled with `clique` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1`. The `arr` array will have values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` placed in reverse order starting from index `left + mid - 1` down to `left`.

All other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`) will retain their values from the initial state or previous iterations.
