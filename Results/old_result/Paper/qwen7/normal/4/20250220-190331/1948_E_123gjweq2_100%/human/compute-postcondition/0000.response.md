Output State: **`left` is an integer such that 0 <= left < right < n; `right` is an integer such that 0 <= left < right < n; `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier; `small_element` is left + 1.**

In this case, the code assigns `left + 1` to the variable `small_element`. The values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged, and `clique` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `small_element` as `left + 1`.
