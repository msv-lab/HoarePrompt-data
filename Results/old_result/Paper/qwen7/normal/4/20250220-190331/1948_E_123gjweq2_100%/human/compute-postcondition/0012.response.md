Output State: **`mid` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, `cliquess[left + 1]` is `clique`, `arr[left + mid - 2]` is `small_element + 1`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `small_element + 1 + 1**.

Explanation: The code `cliquess[left + i] = clique` updates the value of `cliquess[left + i]` to `clique`. Since `i` is 1, `cliquess[left + i]` becomes `cliquess[left + 1]`, which is now set to `clique`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
