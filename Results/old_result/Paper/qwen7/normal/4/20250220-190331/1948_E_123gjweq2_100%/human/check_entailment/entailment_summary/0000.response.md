Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires assigning distinct integers to vertices of a graph such that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two arrays `arr` and `cliquess` of size `n`.
   - It calls `make_array` to fill `arr` and `cliquess` based on the calculated number of cliques.

3. **Analyzing `make_array`**:
   - `make_array` fills parts of the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays based on the specified range and clique index.
   - It ensures that within each segment of `arr`, the values are distinct and cover the range from `small_element` to `big_element`.
   - It assigns the same clique index to all elements within the specified range in `cliquess`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The approach of dividing the vertices into segments based on `k` and assigning each segment to a different clique is logically sound.
   - Given the constraints, this method will ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques because each segment will form a complete subgraph (clique).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the upper limit of `n` (40) and `k` (2*n) correctly.
   - For smaller values of `n` and `k`, the solution will still work as expected.

Conclusion:
The provided implementation correctly addresses the problem statement and meets all the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
