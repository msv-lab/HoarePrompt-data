Output State: **`mid` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `small_element + i`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + i]`. The values of `mid`, `i`, and `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
