Output State: **`i` is 4, `not_mid` must be greater than 0, `cliquess[left + mid + 4]` is equal to `clique`, `arr[left + mid + 1]` is set to `big_element - 1`, `arr[left + mid + 2]` is set to `big_element - 2`, `arr[left + mid + 4]` is set to `big_element - 4`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cliquess[left + mid + i]` to `clique`. Given that `i` is initially 4, the updated value of `cliquess[left + mid + 4]` is now `clique`. All other variables remain unchanged.
