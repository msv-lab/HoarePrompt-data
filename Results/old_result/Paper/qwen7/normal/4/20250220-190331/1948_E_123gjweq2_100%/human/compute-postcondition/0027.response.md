The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. Both `left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n`, and `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier. The function does not specify a particular return value or behavior beyond the parameter constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `make_array` is to accept two integers `left` and `right` (with the given constraints) and one integer `clique`, and it returns nothing as no specific return value is mentioned.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `left` and `right` (with `0 <= left < right < n`) and one integer `clique`, and returns nothing.**
