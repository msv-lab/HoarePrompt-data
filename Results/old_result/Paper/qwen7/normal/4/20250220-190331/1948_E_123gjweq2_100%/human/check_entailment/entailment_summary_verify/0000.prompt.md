You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

- Program:
from math import ceil
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

#Function 2:
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `make_array` takes two integers `left` and `right` (where `0 <= left < right < n`), and one integer `clique`. It modifies two arrays `arr` and `cliquess` in place. Specifically, it fills a portion of the `cliquess` array with the value `clique` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` and from `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`, where `mid` and `not_mid` are calculated based on `left`, `right`, `small_element`, and `big_element`. Additionally, it fills a portion of the `arr` array with values ranging from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` in reverse order and from `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` to `big_element` in ascending order. The function does not return anything.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to partition the graph into the minimum possible number of cliques. Specifically, the `make_array` function is not correctly assigning values to the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays based on the conditions specified in the problem description.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the input `n = 5` and `k = 4`. According to the problem description, we need to assign distinct integers from 1 to 5 to the vertices such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques. The condition for adding an edge between vertices \(i\) and \(j\) is \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\).

Let's analyze the output of the program for this case:

```
3 1
1 1 2 1 2
```

This suggests that the values assigned to the vertices are `[3, 1, 2, 1, 2]`, and the graph is partitioned into 1 clique. However, this assignment does not satisfy the condition for all pairs of vertices. For example, consider vertices 1 and 3:

- \(|1 - 3| + |3 - 2| = 2 + 1 = 3 > 4\)

This means there should not be an edge between vertices 1 and 3, but according to the condition, there should be an edge because \(k = 4\). Therefore, the assignment `[3, 1, 2, 1, 2]` does not satisfy the condition for all pairs of vertices.

Thus, the program does not correctly partition the graph into the minimum possible number of cliques for all inputs, making it incorrect.
