Output State: **`mid` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `small_element + i`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `small_element + i` to the element at the index `left + mid - i - 1` in the array `arr`. Given that `i` is 0 initially, the index simplifies to `left + mid - 1`. Since `small_element` and `i` are not given specific values, the updated state reflects that `arr[left + mid - 1]` now holds the value `small_element + 0`, which is simply `small_element`. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.
