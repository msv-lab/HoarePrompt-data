Output State: **`i` is 4, `not_mid` must be greater than 0, `cliquess[left + mid + 3]` is equal to `clique`, `arr[left + mid + 1]` is set to `big_element - 1`, `arr[left + mid + 2]` is set to `big_element - 2`, `arr[left + mid + 4]` is set to `big_element - 4`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `arr[left + mid + i]` to `big_element - i`. Given that `i` is 4, `arr[left + mid + 4]` is updated to `big_element - 4`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
