Output State: **`i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the values entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still 2, and `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the values entered by the user.
