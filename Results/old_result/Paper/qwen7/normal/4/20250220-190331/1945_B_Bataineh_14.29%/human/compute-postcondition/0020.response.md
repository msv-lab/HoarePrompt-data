Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers a, b, and m, where 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. It returns a result based on these integers.**

Note: The function does not explicitly accept parameters `a`, `b`, and `m` in its definition, but these values are implied to be part of the input through the context provided.
