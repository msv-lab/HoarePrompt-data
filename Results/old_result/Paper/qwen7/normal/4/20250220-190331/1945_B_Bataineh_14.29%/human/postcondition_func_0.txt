The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\). For each test case, it calculates and prints either 2 or the value of \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 2\) based on whether \(m\) is less than both \(a\) and \(b\).
