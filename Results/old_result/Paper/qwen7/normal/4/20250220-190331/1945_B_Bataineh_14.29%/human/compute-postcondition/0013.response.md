Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is assigned the first integer from the input, `b` is assigned the second integer from the input, `m` is assigned the third integer from the input. If `m` is less than either `a` or `b`, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, or `m`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, or `m`.**
