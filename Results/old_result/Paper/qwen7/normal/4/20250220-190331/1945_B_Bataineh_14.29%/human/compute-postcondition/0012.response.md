Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a value greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `a` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `b` is assigned the second integer from the input.
- `m` is assigned the third integer from the input.

The expression to be evaluated and printed is `m // a + m // b + 2`.

Here, `//` denotes integer division. Let's break down the expression:

- `m // a` results in the integer division of `m` by `a`.
- `m // b` results in the integer division of `m` by `b`.
- Adding these two results together gives us the sum of the integer divisions.
- Finally, adding 2 to this sum gives the final result.

So, the output will be the value of `m // a + m // b + 2`.

Output: **m // a + m // b + 2 (where `a`, `b`, and `m` are the input integers)**
