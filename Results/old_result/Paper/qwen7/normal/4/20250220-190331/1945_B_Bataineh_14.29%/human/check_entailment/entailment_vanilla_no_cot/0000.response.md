Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the `if` statement is incorrect and does not account for the actual intervals at which fireworks are launched and their visibility periods.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` because that's the interval at which both installations will launch fireworks at the same time. We then need to calculate how many fireworks can be launched within the visibility period `m` and account for the simultaneous launches.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        # Calculate the number of times each installation launches fireworks within the visibility period
        count_a = (m // a) + 1
        count_b = (m // b) + 1
        # Calculate the number of times both installations launch fireworks at the same time within the visibility period
        count_both = (m // lcm_ab) + 1
        # The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is the sum of individual counts minus the double-counted simultaneous launches plus one for the initial simultaneous launch
        max_visible = count_a + count_b - count_both + 1
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This corrected function should provide the right answer for the problem.
