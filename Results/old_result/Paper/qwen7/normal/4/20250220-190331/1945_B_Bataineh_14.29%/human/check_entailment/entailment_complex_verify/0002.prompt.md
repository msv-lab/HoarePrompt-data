You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

    2000000000000000002
    
Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if m < a or m < b:
            print(2)
        else:
            print(m // a + m // b + 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three integers a, b, and m, where 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if m < a or m < b:
            print(2)
        else:
            print(m // a + m // b + 2)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `m` will be updated to the values entered by the user for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\). For each test case, it calculates and prints either 2 or the value of \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 2\) based on whether \(m\) is less than both \(a\) and \(b\).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` representing the frequency of launching for the first installation, the second installation, and the visibility time of the fireworks, respectively.
   
3. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if `m < a` or `m < b`. If either condition is true, it prints `2`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates and prints `m // a + m // b + 2`.

### Reasoning

1. **Case When `m < a` or `m < b`**:
   - If `m < a` or `m < b`, the program correctly prints `2`. This is because the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously would be at most 2, as the next launch of one installation would overlap with the previous launch of the other installation.

2. **General Case**:
   - For the general case where `m >= a` and `m >= b`, the program calculates `m // a` and `m // b` which represent the number of launches of the first and second installation within the visibility period `m`.
   - The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is used to calculate the total number of fireworks visible at the same time.
     - `m // a` gives the number of launches from the first installation.
     - `m // b` gives the number of launches from the second installation.
     - Adding `2` accounts for the initial simultaneous launches at `0` and the last overlapping launch.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the example provided:

- **Test Case 1**: `a = 6`, `b = 7`, `m = 4`
  - `m < a` or `m < b` is false, so we use the general formula.
  - `m // a = 0`, `m // b = 0`, thus `0 + 0 + 2 = 2` (correct).

- **Test Case 2**: `a = 3`, `b = 4`, `m = 10`
  - `m // a = 3`, `m // b = 2`, thus `3 + 2 + 2 = 7` (correct).

- **Test Case 3**: `a = 7`, `b = 8`, `m = 56`
  - `m // a = 8`, `m // b = 7`, thus `8 + 7 + 2 = 17` (correct).

- **Test Case 4**: `a = 5`, `b = 6`, `m = 78123459896`
  - `m // a = 15624691979`, `m // b = 13020576649`, thus `15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268630` (correct).

- **Test Case 5**: `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `m = 1`
  - `m // a = 1`, `m // b = 1`, thus `1 + 1 + 2 = 4` (correct).

- **Test Case 6**: `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `m = 1000000000000000000`
  - `m // a = 1000000000000000000`, `m // b = 1000000000000000000`, thus `1000000000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 + 2 = 2000000000000000002` (correct).
