Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `m` will be updated to the values entered by the user for each iteration of the loop.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will have the value `t-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. For each iteration, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` will be set to the integers provided as input for that iteration, regardless of whether the condition `m < a or m < b` is met.
