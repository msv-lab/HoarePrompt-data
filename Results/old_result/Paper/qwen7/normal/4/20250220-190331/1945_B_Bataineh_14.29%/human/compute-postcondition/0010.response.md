Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is assigned the first integer from the input, `b` is assigned the second integer from the input, `m` is assigned the third integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into three integers, and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `m` respectively. The initial conditions for `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged except for the assignment of the input values to `a`, `b`, and `m`.
