Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution and why it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. This is done correctly using a loop that iterates `t` times.

2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`. This part is also correct.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program checks if `m < a` or `m < b`. If either condition is true, it prints `2`. This is because if the visibility period `m` is less than the interval between launches for either installation, the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time would be 2 (one from each installation).

4. **General Case Calculation**: If neither of the conditions in the `if` statement is met, the program calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time using the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`. This formula is derived from the observation that the number of fireworks visible from each installation at any given time is approximately `m // a` and `m // b`, respectively. Adding `2` accounts for the possibility of fireworks from both installations being visible at the same time within the visibility period.

5. **Output**: The calculated result is printed for each test case.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly handles all the described scenarios and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
