Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `q` is a positive integer.
- `i` is initially set to 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user.
- The condition `a < b > c` holds true, or `b` is not greater than `c`.

The print statement is:

```python
print('PEAK')
```

This statement will print the string `'PEAK'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, and `q`, because the print statement is simply outputting a hardcoded string.

Output: **'PEAK'**
