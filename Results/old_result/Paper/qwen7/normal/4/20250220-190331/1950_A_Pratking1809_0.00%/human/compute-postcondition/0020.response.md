Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user, and either the condition `a < b > c` holds true, or `b` is not greater than `c`; in all cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of the integers input by the user.**
