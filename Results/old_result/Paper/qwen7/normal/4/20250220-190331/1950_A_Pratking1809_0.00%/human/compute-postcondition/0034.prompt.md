You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user. If `a < b < c`, the condition remains unchanged; otherwise, the conditions `a < b > c` or `b` is not greater than `c` hold true for each iteration of the loop. The variable `mn` remains 100 as it is not affected by the loop.
    #
    #This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will still be within the range of 1 to 1000, `q` will be a positive integer indicating the number of iterations, `i` will be equal to `q` (the total number of iterations), and `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the last set of integers input by the user during the final iteration of the loop. The variable `mn` will remain unchanged at 100 since it is not involved in any operations within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a string indicating whether a given combination of integers (a, b, c) within specified ranges forms a valid condition.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
