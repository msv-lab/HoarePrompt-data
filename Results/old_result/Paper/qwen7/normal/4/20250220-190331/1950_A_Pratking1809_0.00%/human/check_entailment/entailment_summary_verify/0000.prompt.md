You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple sets of three integers (a, b, c) from the user, each set within the range 0 to 9. For each set, it checks if a < b < c, in which case it prints 'STAIR'. If a < b > c, it prints 'PEAK'. Otherwise, it prints 'NONE'. After processing all sets, the function does not return anything (None).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `b` is equal to `c`. According to the problem description, if `a < b == c`, it should still be classified as a "NONE" case. However, the current implementation will incorrectly classify such cases as "STAIR" or "PEAK".

For example, consider the input `1 5 5`. Based on the problem description, this should be classified as "NONE", but the current program will incorrectly classify it as "STAIR" because it checks `a < b < c` first, which fails, then it checks `a < b > c` which also fails, but since it doesn't handle the equality case properly, it might mistakenly classify it as "STAIR" or "PEAK" depending on the order of the checks.

To fix this, the program should explicitly check for the equality case before classifying it as "STAIR" or "PEAK". Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for _ in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')

func()
```

This ensures that all potential cases are handled correctly according to the problem description.
