Reasoning:
1. The function starts by reading an integer `q` which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then enters a loop that runs `q` times, where for each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. Inside the loop, there are two conditions checked:
   - `if a < b < c`: This checks if the numbers form a stair.
   - `if a < b > c`: This checks if the numbers form a peak.
4. If both conditions fail, it prints 'NONE'.
5. However, the issue lies in the placement of the `else` block. The `else` block should be outside the nested `if` blocks to ensure that only one condition is evaluated per iteration. Currently, the `else` block is incorrectly placed, causing the program to always print 'NONE' if the first condition fails.
6. The variable `mn` is not used in the logic and can be safely removed.

To fix this, the `else` block should be moved outside the nested `if` blocks:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

Given the current implementation, the logic is flawed due to the incorrect placement of the `else` block. Therefore, the program is currently incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
