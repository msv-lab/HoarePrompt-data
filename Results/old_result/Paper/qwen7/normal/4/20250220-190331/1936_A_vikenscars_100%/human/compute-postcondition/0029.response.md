Output State: **`max_item_idx` is 3, `pair_idx` is 0, `i` is 0, `ans1` is '=', `ans2` is '>', and the current value of `ans2` is '>'**

Explanation: The code `pair_idx = i` updates the value of `pair_idx` to be the same as the current value of `i`, which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
