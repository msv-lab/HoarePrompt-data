Output State: **`max_item_idx` is 3, `pair_idx` is 1, `i` is 1, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(3, 0, 3, 1)`, `ans2` is the result of `func_1(0, 0, 1, 1)`**.

Explanation: The line `pair_idx = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 1) to `pair_idx`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
