### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine if it meets the problem requirements.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for making a query and returning the result.
   - It takes four parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` and returns a string indicating the result of the comparison between `(p_a | p_b)` and `(p_c | p_d)`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i âŠ• p_j` is maximized.
   - It initializes `max_item_idx` to 0 and iterates through the rest of the indices to find the index with the highest bitwise OR value when compared to itself.
   - After finding `max_item_idx`, it further refines `pair_idx` by comparing it with all other indices and adjusting based on the results of the queries.
   - Finally, it prints the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`.

#### Analysis:

1. **Finding `max_item_idx`**:
   - The loop iterates from 1 to `n-1` and compares each index `i` with `max_item_idx` using `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `max_item_idx` to `i`.
   - This ensures that `max_item_idx` holds the index with the highest bitwise OR value when compared to itself.

2. **Refining `pair_idx`**:
   - The loop iterates through all indices and compares `max_item_idx` with each index `i` using `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `pair_idx` to `i`.
   - If the result is `=`, it further checks using `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)` to ensure that `pair_idx` is indeed the better choice.
   - This ensures that `pair_idx` is the index that maximizes the bitwise XOR value with `max_item_idx`.

3. **Query Count**:
   - The code makes at most 2n + 1 queries (1 for finding `max_item_idx` and up to 2n for refining `pair_idx`).
   - Since the problem allows up to 3n queries, this approach is within the limit.

4. **Output**:
   - The code correctly prints the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` in the required format.

Given the above analysis, the code appears to meet the problem requirements and constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
