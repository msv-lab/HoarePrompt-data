Output State: **`max_item_idx` is 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is the return value of `func_1(2, 2, 3, 3)`**

Explanation: The initial state is that `max_item_idx` is 2, `i` is 3, and `ans` is the return value of `func_1(1, 1, 2, 2)`. The code updates `ans` to be the return value of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, which translates to `func_1(2, 2, 3, 3)`. Since `max_item_idx` and `i` remain unchanged, their values stay the same. The value of `ans` is now the return value of `func_1(2, 2, 3, 3)`.
