Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes four indices \(a, b, c, d\) and prints a query in the required format.
   - It then reads the comparison result (either `<`, `>`, or `=`) and returns it.
   - This function is correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - It starts by initializing `max_item_idx` to 0.
   - It iterates through indices from 1 to \(n-1\) and uses `func_1` to compare \(p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_i\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\).
     - If the result is `<`, it updates `max_item_idx` to \(i\).
   - After finding the index with the maximum bitwise OR with itself, it initializes `pair_idx` to `max_item_idx`.
   - It then iterates through all indices and uses `func_1` to compare \(p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_{pair_idx}\) with \(p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_i\).
     - If the result is `<`, it updates `pair_idx` to \(i\).
     - If the result is `=`, it further checks \(p_{pair_idx} \mid p_{pair_idx}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\) to ensure it's not just equal but greater.
   - Finally, it prints the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`.

### Key Points to Consider:

1. **Finding the Maximum Bitwise OR**:
   - The first loop correctly identifies the index with the highest bitwise OR with itself.
   - However, the second loop does not guarantee that the final `pair_idx` will give the maximum XOR. It only ensures that the bitwise OR with `max_item_idx` is maximized, but it doesn't consider the overall maximum XOR.

2. **Maximizing XOR**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum XOR, not just the maximum bitwise OR.
   - The current approach might miss the optimal pair because it only ensures the maximum bitwise OR, not the maximum XOR.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It finds the maximum bitwise OR but does not necessarily find the maximum XOR.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
