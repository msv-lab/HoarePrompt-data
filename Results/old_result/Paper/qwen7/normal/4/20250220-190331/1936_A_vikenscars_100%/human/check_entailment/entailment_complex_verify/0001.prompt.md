You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

- Annotated Code: 
import sys

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    func_2(n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, c, and d are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n.
def func_1(a, b, c, d):
    request = f'? {a} {b} {c} {d}'
    print(request, flush=True)
    #This is printed: '? a b c d'
    return input()
    #The program returns a string input requested from the user starting with '?' followed by the integers a, b, c, d
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four integer parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, each in the range [0, n), and returns a string input from the user. This returned string starts with a question mark (`?`) followed by the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` in the same order.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4.
def func_2(n):
    max_item_idx = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans = func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)
        
        if ans == '<':
            max_item_idx = i
        
    #State: max_item_idx is 3.
    pair_idx = max_item_idx
    for i in range(n):
        ans1 = func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)
        
        if ans1 == '<':
            pair_idx = i
        elif ans1 == '=':
            ans2 = func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)
            if ans2 == '>':
                pair_idx = i
        
    #State: max_item_idx is 3, pair_idx is 2.
    print(f'! {max_item_idx} {pair_idx}')
    #This is printed: ! 3 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and determines two indices, `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`, based on comparisons using `func_1`. It then prints these indices in the format `! max_item_idx pair_idx`. The final output is `! 3 2`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes four indices \(a, b, c, d\) and prints a query in the required format.
   - It then reads the comparison result (either `<`, `>`, or `=`) and returns it.
   - This function is correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - It starts by initializing `max_item_idx` to 0.
   - It iterates through indices from 1 to \(n-1\) and uses `func_1` to compare \(p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_i\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\).
     - If the result is `<`, it updates `max_item_idx` to \(i\).
   - After finding the index with the maximum bitwise OR with itself, it initializes `pair_idx` to `max_item_idx`.
   - It then iterates through all indices and uses `func_1` to compare \(p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_{pair_idx}\) with \(p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_i\).
     - If the result is `<`, it updates `pair_idx` to \(i\).
     - If the result is `=`, it further checks \(p_{pair_idx} \mid p_{pair_idx}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\) to ensure it's not just equal but greater.
   - Finally, it prints the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`.

### Key Points to Consider:

1. **Finding the Maximum Bitwise OR**:
   - The first loop correctly identifies the index with the highest bitwise OR with itself.
   - However, the second loop does not guarantee that the final `pair_idx` will give the maximum XOR. It only ensures that the bitwise OR with `max_item_idx` is maximized, but it doesn't consider the overall maximum XOR.

2. **Maximizing XOR**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum XOR, not just the maximum bitwise OR.
   - The current approach might miss the optimal pair because it only ensures the maximum bitwise OR, not the maximum XOR.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It finds the maximum bitwise OR but does not necessarily find the maximum XOR.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
