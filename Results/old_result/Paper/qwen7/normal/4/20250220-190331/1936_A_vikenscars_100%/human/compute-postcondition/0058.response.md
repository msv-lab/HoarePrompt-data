Output State: max_item_idx is 3, pair_idx is 2.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (from `i=0` to `i=n-1`), the value of `pair_idx` will be the last index `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)` evaluated to '<' or '=' followed by `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)` evaluating to '>'. Given the output states after the first three iterations, it is clear that `pair_idx` was updated to 0, then 1, and finally 2. Since no further updates occurred after `i=2`, `pair_idx` remains 2 after all iterations of the loop. The value of `max_item_idx` does not change because it is not modified within the loop.
