### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `func_1` takes four indices `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` and prints a query to the standard output.
   - It then reads the response from the user, which can be `<`, `>`, or `=`.
   - The function returns the response string.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - `func_2` aims to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized.
   - It initializes `max_item_idx` to 0 and iterates through the range `[1, n)` to find the index `i` where `(p_{max_item_idx} | p_i)` is minimized. This effectively finds the index of the smallest element under bitwise OR with the current `max_item_idx`.
   - Then it iterates again to find the index `pair_idx` such that `(p_{max_item_idx} | p_{pair_idx})` is maximized while ensuring `(p_{pair_idx} | p_i)` is not less than `(p_{max_item_idx} | p_i)` for all `i`.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_2` seems to be aiming to find the indices that maximize the bitwise XOR of the permutation elements.
   - However, the approach used might not guarantee finding the optimal pair of indices for maximizing `p_i ⊕ p_j`.
   - Specifically, the first loop to find `max_item_idx` is flawed because it minimizes the bitwise OR, not necessarily maximizing the XOR.
   - The second loop to find `pair_idx` also has issues. It does not ensure that the pair found maximizes the XOR but rather focuses on the OR condition.

Given the above analysis, the provided implementation does not correctly identify the indices that maximize the bitwise XOR of the permutation elements. Therefore, the function `func_2` is not guaranteed to work as intended.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
