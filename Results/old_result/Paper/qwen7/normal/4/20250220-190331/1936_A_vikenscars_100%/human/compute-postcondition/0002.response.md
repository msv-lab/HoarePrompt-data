Output State: **`max_item_idx` is 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is `func_1(0, 0, 1, 1)`**

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1` with arguments `max_item_idx`, `max_item_idx`, `i`, and `i`. Since `max_item_idx` is 0 and `i` is 1, `func_1(0, 0, 1, 1)` is assigned to `ans`. The values of `n` and `max_item_idx` remain unchanged, and `i` remains 1. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid but is not directly affected by the code.
