Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Base Case Handling**: For `x = 2`, the program prints `1` and `0`, which is correct because an array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences (`[]` and `[0]`).
3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program calculates the binary representation of `x` in terms of powers of 2. This is done through the loop where `i` is incremented until `2 ** i > x`. Each time `2 ** (i-1)` is subtracted from `x`, it corresponds to including a new element in the array that contributes to forming the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The `subseq_lens` list stores the lengths of these subsequences, and `mx` keeps track of the maximum length.
   - After processing, `ansv` is constructed to represent the array that generates the required number of increasing subsequences.
4. **Output**:
   - The length of the array is printed first.
   - Then, the elements of the array are printed, ensuring that the number of increasing subsequences matches `x`.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program seems to correctly generate an array that meets the criteria for the given `x` values. However, there is a discrepancy in the output for the first test case. The program incorrectly prints `3` instead of `1` when `x = 2`. 

Correctness: **False**

The program should handle the base case `x = 2` correctly by printing `1` and `0` instead of `3` and the elements `[0]`.
