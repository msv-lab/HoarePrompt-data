You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

MOD = 1000000007
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if x == 2:
        print(1)
        print(0)
        return
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
    print(len(ansv))
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer input `x` and processes it to find the maximum length of a subsequence where each element is a power of 2. It then constructs a list `ansv` based on this maximum length and prints the length of `ansv` followed by its elements. The function ultimately returns `None`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to generate an array of integers with a specified number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The program needs to handle up to 1000 test cases, where `X` can be as large as \(10^{18}\).

2. **Key Insight**: The number of increasing subsequences in an array can be determined by the lengths of its longest increasing subsequences (LIS). Specifically, if we have an array of length `n` with `k` distinct values, the number of increasing subsequences can be calculated using combinations.

3. **Approach in the Code**:
   - The code attempts to construct an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - It uses a binary representation approach to determine the lengths of the LIS needed to achieve the desired count of increasing subsequences.
   - For each bit position in the binary representation of `X`, it tries to add a new value to the array, ensuring the count of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

4. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code correctly identifies when `X` is 2 and prints `[0]`.
   - For other values of `X`, it constructs an array by adding elements in a way that ensures the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.
   - The logic for constructing the array seems to follow the principle of breaking down `X` into powers of 2, which helps in achieving the exact count of increasing subsequences.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where `X` is 2 correctly.
   - For larger values of `X`, the code constructs arrays that meet the requirement, although the specific construction might not always be optimal or unique.

6. **Output Format**:
   - The code outputs the length of the array followed by the array itself.
   - The output format matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

The provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for generating an array with a specified number of increasing subsequences. It handles the edge case of `X` being 2 and constructs arrays for larger values of `X` in a manner that satisfies the problem constraints.

**Correctness: True**
