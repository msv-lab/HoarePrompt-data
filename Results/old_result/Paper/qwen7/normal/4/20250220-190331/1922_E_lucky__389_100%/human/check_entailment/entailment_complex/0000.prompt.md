Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    #
    #In simpler terms, `mx` will hold the maximum length of the subsequence found during the loop's iterations, `x` will be reduced to 0 after all iterations, `subseq_lens` will contain a list of lengths of subsequences found, and `i` will be the highest power of 2 that fits into the current value of `x` at the beginning of each iteration.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `mx` is the maximum value found among the values appended to `subseq_lens`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing all the values of `i - 1` found during each iteration of the loop until `x` becomes 0, `i` is `len(subseq_lens) + 1`, `len(subseq_lens)` is at least 4, and `ansv` is a list that now contains three additional elements which are `subseq_lens[1]`, `subseq_lens[2]`, and `subseq_lens[3]`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `subseq_lens` will contain at least four elements (since it starts with at least two elements and the loop appends one more element per iteration). The variable `ansv` will have been updated to include the last three elements that were appended to `subseq_lens` during the loop's iterations. The variable `i` will be set to the length of `subseq_lens` plus one, indicating that the loop has completed its execution. The value of `mx` will be the highest value found in `subseq_lens`, and `t` remains within the specified range.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 3
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: `i` is 3, `ansv` contains at least 7 elements, `mx` is the maximum value found among the values in `subseq_lens`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains at least 7 elements, and `ansv` includes the last three elements appended to `subseq_lens` during the loop's iterations.
    print()
    #This is printed: Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer input `x` and processes it to find the maximum length of a subsequence where each element is a power of 2. It then constructs a list `ansv` based on this maximum length and prints the length of `ansv` followed by its elements. The function ultimately returns `None`.
