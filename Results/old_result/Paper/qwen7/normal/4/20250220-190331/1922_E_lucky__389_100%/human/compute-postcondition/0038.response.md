Output State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is at least 16, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value `i - 1`, `i` is the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\)**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i - 1` to the list `subseq_lens`. The value of `i` is determined such that \(2^i > x\). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
