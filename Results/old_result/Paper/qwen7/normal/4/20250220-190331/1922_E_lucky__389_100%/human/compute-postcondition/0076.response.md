Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to 2.
- `ansv` must have at least 5 elements.

The `print(ansv[i], end=' ')` statement will access the third element of the list `ansv` (since list indices start at 0, `i = 2` corresponds to the third element).

However, the value of `ansv[i]` is not explicitly given. Since `ansv` must have at least 5 elements, we know it has a third element, but we don't know its specific value.

Therefore, the output will be the third element of `ansv`.

Output: **ansv[2]**
