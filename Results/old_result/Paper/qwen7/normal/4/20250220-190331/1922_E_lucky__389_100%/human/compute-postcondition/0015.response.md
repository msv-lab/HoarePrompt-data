Output State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input integer and \(x \geq 2\) and \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq 2\) and \(8 \leq x\), `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `i` is 4**.

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
