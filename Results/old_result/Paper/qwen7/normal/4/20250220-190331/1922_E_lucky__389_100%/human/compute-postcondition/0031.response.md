Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `2 ** i <= x`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `mx` is 0.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `x` must be at least 4.
   - `subseq_lens` is an empty list.
   - `i` is 3.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop condition is `2 ** i <= x`, we need to check if `2 ** i` is still less than or equal to `x` with the current value of `i`.
   - With `i = 3`, `2 ** i = 2 ** 3 = 8`.
   - For the loop to continue, `x` must be at least 8 (since `x` must be at least 4, and `2 ** 3 = 8`).

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, which means `2 ** i` should still be less than or equal to `x`.
   - Therefore, `x` must be at least 8.
   - Other states like `mx`, `t`, `subseq_lens`, and `i` do not need adjustment as they do not affect the loop condition directly.

So, the state that needs to be adjusted is `x` to be at least 8.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` must be at least 8, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `i` is 3**
