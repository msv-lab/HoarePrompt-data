Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is a list containing two elements `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1])]`, `y` is a list containing one element `int(xylist[1])`, `i` is 0, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by space.**

Explanation: The code appends `int(xylist[1])` to the list `y`. Initially, `y` is an empty list. After appending, `y` contains one element, which is the integer value of `xylist[1]`. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `i`, and `xylist`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
