Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is a list containing three elements `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0])]`, `y` is a list containing one element `int(xylist[1])`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `x.append(int(xylist[0]))` appends the value of `int(xylist[0])` to the list `x`. Initially, `x` contains two elements `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1])]`. After appending `int(xylist[0])`, `x` now contains three elements: `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0])]`. The values of `t`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged.
