Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `10`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is not initialized in the loop head but will be set to the values from 0 to 9 during the loop execution.
   - The constant `10` is the upper limit for the range function.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `10`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` will take values from 0 to 9, we need to ensure that `i` starts at 0 and increments until it reaches 9.
   - The value of `10` remains constant and does not need adjustment.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `i` starting at 0 and incrementing until it reaches 9.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an empty list, `y` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
