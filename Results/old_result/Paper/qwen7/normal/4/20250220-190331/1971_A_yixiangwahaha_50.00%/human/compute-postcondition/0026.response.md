Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: 
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
   - `x` is a list containing 10 elements: `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])]`.
   - `y` is a list containing 9 elements: `int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])`.
   - `i` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 9`. 

4. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0 (since it just started).

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.

6. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
   - `i` changes to 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is a list containing 10 elements `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])]`, `y` is a list containing 9 elements `int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])`, `i` is 1**.
