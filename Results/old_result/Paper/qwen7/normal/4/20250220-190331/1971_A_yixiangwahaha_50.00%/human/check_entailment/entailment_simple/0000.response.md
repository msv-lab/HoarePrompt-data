Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y`.
3. It then tries to store these values in lists `x` and `y` but with an incorrect approach. Specifically, it alternates between storing the first and second values of `xylist` into `x` and stores the second value of `xylist` into `y` for each iteration.
4. After processing all test cases, the program incorrectly compares and prints the minimum and maximum values for each pair `(x[i], y[i])` without resetting the lists `x` and `y` for each new test case.

Given the problem description, the program should read `t` test cases, and for each test case, it should read two integers `x` and `y`, then print the minimum and maximum of each pair. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the input for multiple test cases and does not reset the lists `x` and `y` for each new test case.

Correctness: **False**
