Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is a list containing 10 elements `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])]`, `y` is a list containing 9 elements `int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])`, `i` is 1, and if `x[i] < y[i]`, then no change occurs; otherwise, no change occurs as well.
