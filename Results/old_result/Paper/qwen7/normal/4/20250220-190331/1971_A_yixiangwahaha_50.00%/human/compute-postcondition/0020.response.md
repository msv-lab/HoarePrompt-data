Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `x` is a list containing 10 elements: `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])]`.
- `y` is a list containing 9 elements: `[int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])]`.
- `i` is 0.
- `xylist` is a list containing the split input values from the last iteration of the loop.
- The current value of `x[i]` is less than the current value of `y[i]`.

Given `i` is 0, we need to determine the values of `x[0]` and `y[0]`.

From the definition of `x` and `y`:
- `x[0] = xylist[0]`
- `y[0] = int(xylist[1])`

Since `x[0]` is less than `y[0]`, `xylist[0]` must be a string that, when converted to an integer, is less than `int(xylist[1])`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **xylist[0] int(xylist[1])**
