Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is a list containing 10 elements `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0])]`, `y` is a list containing 9 elements `int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])`, `i` is 9, `xylist` is a list containing the split input values from the last iteration of the loop.

This output state describes the final conditions after the loop has completed all 10 iterations. The value of `t` remains within the specified range (1 to 100). The list `x` will contain 10 elements, with the pattern continuing as described, and `y` will have 9 elements, each being the second element of the input split list.
