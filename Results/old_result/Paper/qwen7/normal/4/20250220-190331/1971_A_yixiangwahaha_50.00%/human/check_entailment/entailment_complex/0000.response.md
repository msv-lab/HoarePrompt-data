Reasoning:
- The problem requires reading multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \(x\) and \(y\), and printing the minimum and maximum of each pair.
- The annotated program incorrectly reads 10 pairs of integers instead of reading the number of test cases \(t\) and then reading \(t\) pairs of integers.
- The program initializes empty lists `x` and `y` and then populates them with 10 pairs of integers regardless of the actual number of test cases \(t\).
- This results in incorrect behavior because the program will always process exactly 10 pairs of integers, even if the input specifies fewer test cases.
- Given the example input and expected output, the program should read the number of test cases first and then process each test case accordingly.

Correctness: **False**
