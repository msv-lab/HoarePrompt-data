Reasoning:
1. The problem description states that there will be `t` test cases, where `t` is provided as the first input.
2. The execution summary mentions that the function reads an integer `t` and 10 pairs of integers `(x, y)`, but the problem description specifies that the number of test cases should be read first, followed by the specified number of pairs.
3. The program logic inside the loop correctly identifies the minimum and maximum of each pair and prints them in the required format.
4. However, the program initializes `t` to the first input without actually reading the number of test cases. Instead, it processes exactly 10 pairs of integers regardless of the value of `t`.
5. This means that if `t` is less than 10, the program will process extra pairs, and if `t` is more than 10, the program will stop after processing 10 pairs, ignoring the remaining test cases.

Given these points, the program does not correctly handle the variable number of test cases as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
