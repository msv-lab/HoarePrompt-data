Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `a`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `a` is not empty and there are elements left to iterate over.
3. **Determine the changes at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` must not be empty.
   - `i` is the first element of `a`.
   - `x` contains the first element of `x` appended with the result of `x[-1] ^ i`.
   - `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the first element of `a` at the end of the previous iteration, the next element of `a` (if it exists) will be the new `i`.
   - `a` must still be non-empty for the loop to continue.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `a` must now be a list with its first element being the next element from the original list (if it exists).
- `i` will be the next element from `a`.
- `x` and `inds` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

So, the updated state for the next iteration would be:

State: **`a` must not be empty and its first element must be the next element from the original list, `i` is the next element from `a`, `x` contains the first element of `x` appended with the result of `x[-1] ^ i`, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`**.
