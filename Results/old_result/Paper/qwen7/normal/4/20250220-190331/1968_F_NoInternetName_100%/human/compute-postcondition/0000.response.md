Output State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each element is in the range 0 <= a_i < 2^30, `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n for each query, `n` and `q` have been assigned the values returned by `func_1(int)`**.

This means that the function `func_1(int)` was called with an integer argument, and it returned two values which were assigned to `n` and `q`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
