Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list `a` of integers, and for each query defined by `l` and `r`, it returns a specific value based on the elements in the sublist `a[l:r]`.**

This means the function likely receives a list `a` and multiple queries (each defined by `l` and `r`) and performs operations on the sublist `a[l:r]` for each query, but since the function definition only shows `func_5()` without parameters, it implies the parameters are passed externally and not listed in the function signature.
