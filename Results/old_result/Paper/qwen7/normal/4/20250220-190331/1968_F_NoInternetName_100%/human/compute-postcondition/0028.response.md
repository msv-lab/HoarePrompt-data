Output: **No**

Explanation:
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `q` is a positive integer, but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `x` is a list containing a single element, which is 0.
- `inds` is an empty dictionary, so it does not contain any keys or values.
- `l` and `r` are the results of calling `func_1(int)`. Since the function `func_1` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `l` and `r`, but this does not affect the output of the print statement.
- `upper` is defined as `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= l)]`. Given that `inds` is an empty dictionary, `inds[x[l - 1]]` would be `inds[0]`, which does not exist because the dictionary is empty. Therefore, `upper` would be an error or undefined, but the print statement simply outputs `'No'`.

Thus, the print statement will output `'No'`.
