Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies that `i` is taken from the iterable `a`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` must not be empty and its first element must be the next element from the original list.
   - `i` is the next element from `a`.
   - `x` contains the first element of `x` appended with the result of `x[-1] ^ i`.
   - `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`.
   - `x` is updated with `x[-1] ^ i` appended to itself.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is taken from `a`, for the loop to continue, `a` must still contain elements.
   - The next value of `i` will be the next element in `a`.
   - `x` will be updated with the new value `x[-1] ^ i` appended to itself.
   - `inds[x[-1]]` will include the index `len(x) - 1`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `a` must not be empty and its first element must be the next element from the original list (since `i` comes from `a`).
- `i` will be the next element from `a`.
- `x` will be updated with `x[-1] ^ i` appended to itself.
- `inds[x[-1]]` will include the index `len(x) - 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` must not be empty and its first element must be the next element from the original list, `i` is the next element from `a`, `x` contains the first element of `x` appended with the result of `x[-1] ^ i`, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1` and `x` is updated with `x[-1] ^ i` appended to itself**.
