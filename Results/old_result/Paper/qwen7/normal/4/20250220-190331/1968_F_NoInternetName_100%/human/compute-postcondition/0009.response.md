Output State: **`a` must not be empty and its first element must be the next element from the original list, `i` is the next element from `a`, `x` contains the first element of `x` appended with the result of `x[-1] ^ i`, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`, and `x` is updated with `x[-1] ^ i` appended to itself.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `x[-1] ^ i` to the list `x`. Here, `x[-1]` refers to the last element of `x`, and `^` is the bitwise XOR operator. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
