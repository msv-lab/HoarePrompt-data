Output State: **`i` is 2, `q` is a positive integer, `x` is [0], `inds` is an empty dictionary, `lower` is 0, `r` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `l, r = func_1(int)` calls the function `func_1` with an integer argument, which returns two values `l` and `r`. Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, we assume it takes an integer input and returns two integers. The values of `l` and `r` are thus the result of `func_1(int)`, and they replace the previous values of `l` and `r`. The other variables (`i`, `q`, `x`, `inds`, `lower`) remain unchanged.
