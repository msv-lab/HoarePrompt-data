Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `q` is a positive integer, `x` is [0], `inds` is an empty dictionary, `l` and `r` are the results of `func_1(int)`. If `upper` (which is `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]) is greater than `lower`, then `upper` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `upper` is set to `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= l)].**
