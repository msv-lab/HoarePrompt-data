Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 0
   - `q` is a positive integer
   - `x` is `[0]`
   - `inds` is an empty dictionary
   - `l` and `r` are the results of `func_1(int)`

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < q`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.

4. **States to Adjust**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes with each iteration is `i`.
   - Therefore, we need to update the value of `i` to 1.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `q` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `x` remains `[0]` as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `inds` remains an empty dictionary as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `l` and `r` remain the results of `func_1(int)` as they are not modified within the loop.

6. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition inside the loop does not affect the state of `i` directly but modifies `upper` based on certain conditions involving `inds`, `x`, `l`, and `r`.
   - Since we are only concerned with the state at the start of the next iteration, we do not need to adjust `upper`, `inds`, `x`, `l`, or `r`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `q` is a positive integer, `x` is [0], `inds` is an empty dictionary, `l` and `r` are the results of `func_1(int)`**.
