Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1
- `q` is a positive integer
- `x` is a list containing a single element 0
- `inds` is an empty dictionary
- `lower` is 0
- `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]

Let's break down the expression for `upper`:

1. `x[l - 1]` refers to the last element of `x`. Since `x` contains only one element `[0]`, `l` must be 1, so `x[l - 1]` is `0`.
2. `inds[x[l - 1]]` is `inds[0]`. Since `inds` is an empty dictionary, `inds[0]` does not exist, which means it will raise a `KeyError` if accessed directly. However, since the expression is part of a larger context (likely a function call), it might be evaluated in a way that avoids this error, possibly returning `None` or another default value.
3. `func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)` would then be evaluated with either `None` or a default value, but without knowing the exact implementation of `func_3`, we cannot determine its exact behavior. For the sake of this problem, let's assume `func_3` returns a value that allows the expression to evaluate without raising an error.

Given the above, the expression `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]` will likely evaluate to a value, but the exact value is not specified. However, the important point is that the expression evaluates to something, and the result is used to set `upper`.

Regardless of the exact value of `upper`, the print statement simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
