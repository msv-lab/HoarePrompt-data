Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is interesting. Specifically, the program attempts to use binary search to find indices where the prefix XOR matches certain conditions, but it does not correctly handle the logic for determining if the subarray is interesting.

Here is a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of XOR Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix XOR values and stores them in the `x` list. However, it does not correctly check if the subarray can be divided into `k` parts such that the XOR of each part is equal.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search functions (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`) are used to find indices where the prefix XOR matches certain conditions. These functions do not correctly handle the logic required to determine if the subarray is interesting.

3. **Predicate Functions**: The predicate functions used in the binary search do not correctly determine if the subarray can be divided into parts with equal XOR values.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

- **Input**:
  ```
  5 5
  1 1 2 3 0
  1 5
  2 4
  3 5
  1 3
  3 4
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  YES
  YES
  NO
  NO
  NO
  ```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
YES
YES
NO
NO
NO
```

This is incorrect because the subarray `[1, 2, 3, 0]` can be divided into `[1], [2, 3, 0]` with XOR values `1` and `1` respectively, making it interesting. Similarly, the subarray `[1, 1]` is also interesting.

The program fails to correctly identify these cases due to the incorrect implementation of the binary search and predicate functions.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
