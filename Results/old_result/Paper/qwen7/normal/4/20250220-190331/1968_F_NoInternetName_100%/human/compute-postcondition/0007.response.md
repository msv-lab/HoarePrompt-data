Output State: **`a` must not be empty, `i` is the first element of `a`, `x` contains the first element of `x` appended with the result of `x[-1] ^ i`, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`**.

Explanation: The code appends the index `len(x) - 1` to the list `inds[x[-1]]`. Since `x[-1]` is the last element of `x`, and `len(x) - 1` is the index of the last element, this index is added to the list `inds[x[-1]]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
