### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if a subarray can be divided into `k` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is the same.
   - We need to process multiple test cases and queries efficiently.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If the XOR of the entire subarray is zero, the subarray can always be divided into equal parts with XOR zero.
   - For non-zero XOR values, we need to check if there exists a split point where the XOR of the left and right parts match the overall XOR value.

3. **Code Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** This function reads and splits input data.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):** This function performs binary search.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):** This function is essentially a wrapper for `func_2`.
   - **Function 4 (`func_4`):** This function is another wrapper for `func_2` with an additional offset.
   - **Function 5 (`func_5`):** This function processes the main logic for each test case and query.

4. **Main Logic in `func_5`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - Read `n` and `q`.
     - Read the array `a` and compute the prefix XOR array `x`.
     - Store indices of each unique XOR value in `inds`.
   - **Query Processing:**
     - For each query, check if the XOR of the subarray is zero.
     - If not, use binary search to find potential split points.
     - Check if the split points allow for valid divisions.

5. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function summary indicates that the function checks if the cumulative XOR of the sublist `a[l:r]` is zero. If the cumulative XOR is zero, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.
   - The function also maintains a dictionary `inds` that tracks the indices of each unique cumulative XOR value in the list `x`.

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The code uses binary search to find split points, which is efficient but might not handle edge cases correctly.
   - The logic for checking split points seems overly complex and might not cover all scenarios.

7. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The code appears to follow the problem's requirements.
   - The function summary aligns with the logic implemented in `func_5`.
   - The binary search approach is used to find potential split points, which is a reasonable method for this problem.
   - The code handles the case where the XOR of the entire subarray is zero, which is a crucial condition for the subarray to be interesting.

8. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where the XOR of the entire subarray is zero correctly.
   - The binary search approach should work for finding split points, although it might need optimization for very large arrays.

### Conclusion:

After careful analysis, the provided code seems to follow the problem's requirements and logic. The function summary accurately describes the functionality of the code, and the implementation handles the key conditions correctly.
