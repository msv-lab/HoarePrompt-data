Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`; `suff[i]` is `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`**

Explanation: The initial state is given as `i` is `n - 2`, and `suff[i]` is `suff[n - 1] + c[n - 2]`. The code updates `suff[i]` to `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`. Since `i` is `n - 2`, `i + 1` is `n - 1`. Therefore, `suff[i]` is now updated to `suff[n - 1] + c[n - 2]` (from the initial state) plus `c[n - 2]`, which simplifies to `suff[n - 1] + 2 * c[n - 2]`. However, since the exact value of `suff[n - 1]` is not provided, we keep it in its general form. Thus, the output state is as described.
