Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `suff[i]` is `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains `n - 3` because the code does not change its value. The value of `suff[i]` is updated to `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`. Here, `i + 1` is `(n - 3) + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 2`. Therefore, `suff[i]` is now `suff[n - 2] + c[n - 3]` updated to `suff[n - 1] + c[n - 3]`.
