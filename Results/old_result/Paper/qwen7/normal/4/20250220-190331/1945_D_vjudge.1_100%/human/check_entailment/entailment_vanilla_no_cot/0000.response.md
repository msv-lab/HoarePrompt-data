Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in the queue. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the number of people `n` and the maximum allowable final position `k`.
   - It reads the arrays `a` and `b` which contain the costs for Kirill to move past each person.
3. **Calculating Minimum Cost**:
   - It creates an array `c` where `c[i]` is the minimum cost to move past the `i-th` person (`min(a[i], b[i])`).
   - It calculates the suffix sum array `suff`, where `suff[i]` is the total cost of moving past all people from index `i` to the end.
   - It iterates through the first `k` positions and calculates the total cost of moving Kirill to each of these positions, considering both the cost to move past the current person and the suffix sum of the remaining people.
   - It keeps track of the minimum cost found during this process.
4. **Outputting Result**: Finally, it prints the minimum cost for each test case.

This approach ensures that Kirill minimizes his spending while ensuring he is within the desired position in the queue. The logic and implementation are sound and align with the problem requirements.
