Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines the function `func_1` which takes `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` as parameters.
2. It initializes a list `c` where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.
3. It calculates the suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` represents the sum of elements from `c[i]` to `c[n-1]`.
4. It iterates through the first `k` elements of `a` and calculates the value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for each `i` in the range `[0, k-1]`. This value represents the cost for Kirill to move to position `i` and then to the end of the line.
5. The minimum of these calculated values is stored in `ans` and printed as the result.

Given the logic and the steps followed in the program, it appears that the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. The program follows the specified steps accurately and uses the appropriate logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people.

Correctness: **True**
