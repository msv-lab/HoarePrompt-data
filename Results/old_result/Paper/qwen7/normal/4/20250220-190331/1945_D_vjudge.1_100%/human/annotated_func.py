#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, a is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, a, b):
    c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]
    suff = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `0`; `suff[0]` will be the sum of all elements in the list `c`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop starts from `i = n - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `0`. In each iteration, `suff[i]` is updated to `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`. By the time `i` becomes `0`, `suff[0]` will hold the cumulative sum of all elements in `c` because each `c[i]` is added to `suff[i + 1]` as `i` decreases from `n - 1` to `0`.
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k):
        ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i + 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `k`; `suff[0]` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`; `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `k`, as the loop increments `i` in each iteration until it reaches `k`. The value of `suff[0]` remains unchanged as it is the sum of all elements in the list `c` and is not modified within the loop. The variable `ans` is updated in each iteration to be the minimum value between its current value and `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`. Since `i` reaches `k`, the term `suff[i + 1]` becomes `suff[k + 1]`, which is effectively out of bounds and thus not considered in the final value of `ans`. Therefore, `ans` retains the minimum value found during the loop's execution.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum value between its initial value and all the values of a[i] + suff[i + 1] for each iteration where i ranges from 0 to k-1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and `b` (a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). It computes the minimum value of `a[i] + suffix_sum[i+1]` for all `i` in the range `[0, k-1]`, where `suffix_sum` is the cumulative sum of the element-wise minimum of lists `a` and `b` from index `i` to the end of the lists. The function returns this minimum value.
