Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. The program attempts to count the number of '1's in each row but does not properly check the conditions for a triangle or a square. Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Triangle Check**: A triangle should have rows with counts of '1's following the pattern \(1, 3, 5, \ldots\). The program simply checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, which is insufficient.
2. **Square Check**: A square should have rows with the same number of '1's, evenly spaced. The program does not check this condition.

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to correctly identify the patterns for both shapes. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for _ in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check for Square
        k = len(grid[0]) // 2 + 1
        if all(grid[i].count('1') == k for i in range(k)) and all(grid[i][j] == '0' or j == (len(grid) - 1 - i + j) // 2 for i in range(k) for j in range(len(grid))):
            print("SQUARE")
            continue
        
        # Check for Triangle
        for i in range(1, n):
            if any(grid[j][i - j] != '1' for j in range(i + 1)):
                break
        else:
            print("TRIANGLE")
            continue
        
        # If neither, then there was an error in the input or logic
        print("ERROR")

func()
```

This corrected version properly checks for both a square and a triangle according to their definitions.
