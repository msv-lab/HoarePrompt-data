Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` is the concatenation of all input strings from each iteration of the loop, the variable `k` is an empty list, and the first and second elements of `k` are equal.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    b = input()
    if '1' in b:
        k.append(b.count('1'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `b` is the new input string concatenated to the previous value of `b`. If `b` contains the character '1', `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in `b`, which is 1. If `b` does not contain the character '1', `k` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b` is the previous value of `b` concatenated with the new input string; `k` is a list containing the count of '1' characters in `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `b` is the current value of `b` concatenated with the new input string; `k` is a list containing the count of '1' characters in the new value of `b`. If the new value of `b` contains at least one '1', the count in `k` is incremented by one. If the new value of `b` does not contain any '1', the count in `k` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
