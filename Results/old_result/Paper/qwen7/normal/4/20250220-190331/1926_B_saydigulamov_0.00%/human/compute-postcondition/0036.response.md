Postcondition: `b` is an input string from the user, and `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b`; after executing the if-else block, `k` will be `[b.count('1')]` if the string `b` contains the character '1', and `k` remains unchanged if the string `b` does not contain the character '1'.
