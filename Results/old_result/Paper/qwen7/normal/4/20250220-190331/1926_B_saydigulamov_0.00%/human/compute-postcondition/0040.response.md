Postcondition: **`b` is an input string from the user. After the if else block executes, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in the updated string `b`. If the string `b` contains the character '1', `k` is updated to include the count of '1' in the new string `b`. If the string `b` does not contain the character '1', `k` remains unchanged.**
