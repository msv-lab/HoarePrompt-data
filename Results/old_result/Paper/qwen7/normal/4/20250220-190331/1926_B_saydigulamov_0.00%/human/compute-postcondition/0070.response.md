Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid of '0's and '1's. For each grid, it counts the number of '1's and checks if the '1's form a square or a triangle. If the counts match, it prints the counts. The function does not return any value but prints the counts of '1's if they form a square or a triangle.**
