Postcondition: `b` is the current value of `b` concatenated with the new input string; `k` is a list containing the count of '1' characters in the new value of `b`. If the new value of `b` contains at least one '1', the count in `k` is incremented by one. If the new value of `b` does not contain '1', the count in `k` remains unchanged.
