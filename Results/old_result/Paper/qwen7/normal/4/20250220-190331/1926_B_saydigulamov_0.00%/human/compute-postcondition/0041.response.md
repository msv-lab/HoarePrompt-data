Output State: **Postcondition: `b` is the concatenation of all input strings from each iteration of the loop. The variable `k` is a list containing the cumulative count of '1's found in all the input strings `b` across all iterations.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `b` will be a string that is the concatenation of all the input strings provided during each iteration of the loop. The variable `k` will be a list where each element represents the count of '1's found in the corresponding input string `b` during each iteration. If an input string does not contain the character '1', its count will be zero, and it will still be included in the list `k`.
