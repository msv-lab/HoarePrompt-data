Postcondition: **a must be greater than 0, i is the count of '1' in the string b, k is a list containing the count of '1' in the string b for each iteration of the loop, and b is the final input string from `input()` after all iterations. If the current value of k[0] is equal to the current value of k[1], the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not change.**
