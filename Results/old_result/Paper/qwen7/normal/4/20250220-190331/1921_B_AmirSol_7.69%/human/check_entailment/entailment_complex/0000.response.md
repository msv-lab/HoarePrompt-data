Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` aims to count the number of positions where the initial state (`s1`) and the desired state (`s2`) differ. However, the logic inside the function does not correctly simulate the operations allowed by the problem statement. Specifically, the function does not account for moving cats between boxes or removing/adding cats to achieve the desired state. Instead, it simply counts the number of differing positions, which does not reflect the actual operations needed.

Given the problem constraints and the operations allowed, the function should simulate the process of transforming `s1` into `s2` using the allowed operations (moving, adding, or removing cats). The provided function does not implement these operations and thus does not correctly solve the problem.

Therefore, the function is incorrect because it does not simulate the necessary operations to transform the initial state into the desired state.

Correctness: **False**
