Output State: **`counter` is either 2 or 3, `i` is either 2, 3, or 4, `n` must be greater than 4, and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`**

Explanation: The value of `counter` is incremented by 1, changing its value from either 1 or 2 to either 2 or 3. The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition regarding `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` remain unchanged.
