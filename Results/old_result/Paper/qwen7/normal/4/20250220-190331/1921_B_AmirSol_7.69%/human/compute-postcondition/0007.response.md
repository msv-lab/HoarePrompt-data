Output State: **`counter` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`, and the current value of `i` is less than `n - 1` and the next element in `s1` is not equal to the next element in `s2` and the current element in `s1` is not equal to the next element in `s1`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 2` increments the value of `i` by 2. Given the initial state where `i` is 0, after executing the code, `i` becomes 2. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
