You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1', where the i-th character of s1 is '1' if there is a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise, and the i-th character of s2 is '1' if there should be a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise.
def func_1(n, s1, s2):
    counter = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and s1[i] != s1[i + 1]:
                counter += 1
                i += 2
            else:
                counter += 1
                i += 1
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State: The final value of `counter` will be the total number of positions from 0 to n-1 where `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`. The value of `i` will be `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. `n` will remain the same as the initial value, and both `s1` and `s2` will retain their original string values.
    return counter
    #The program returns the total number of positions from 0 to n-1 where `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n`, and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. It returns the total number of positions from 0 to `n-1` where `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the total number of positions from 0 to n-1 where `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
