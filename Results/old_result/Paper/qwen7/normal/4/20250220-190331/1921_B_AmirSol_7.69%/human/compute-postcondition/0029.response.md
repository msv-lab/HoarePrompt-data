Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is `while i < n:`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `counter` is either 1 or 2.
   - `i` is either 2, 3, or 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - The current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n` at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is currently either 2, 3, or 4, and `n` must be greater than 2, the only way to ensure `i < n` is to ensure that `n` is greater than the current value of `i`.
     - If `i` is 2, then `n` must be greater than 2.
     - If `i` is 3, then `n` must be greater than 3.
     - If `i` is 4, then `n` must be greater than 4.

Given these conditions, the most general adjustment is to ensure that `n` is greater than the maximum possible value of `i`, which is 4.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than 4.

The final state is:
State: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `i` is either 2, 3, or 4, `n` must be greater than 4, and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`**.
