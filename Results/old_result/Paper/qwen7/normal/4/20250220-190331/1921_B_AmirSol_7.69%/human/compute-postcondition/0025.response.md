Output State: **`counter` is 1, `i` is either 2 or 3, `n` must be greater than 2, and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was either 1 or 2, after incrementing, `i` becomes either 2 or 3. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `n` and the values of `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` still hold true.
