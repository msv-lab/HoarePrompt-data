Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Operations:**
   - The logic in `func_1` tries to increment the counter when there is a mismatch between `s1` and `s2`. However, it does not correctly account for all possible operations (adding, removing, or moving cats).
   - The condition `if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and (s1[i] != s1[i + 1])` is overly restrictive and does not cover all scenarios where a cat can be moved.

2. **Simplistic Increment Logic:**
   - The code increments the counter without considering the nature of the operation (addition, removal, or move). It simply counts mismatches without ensuring the minimum number of operations.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Count Cats to Add:** Calculate the difference between `s2` and `s1` to find out how many cats need to be added.
2. **Count Cats to Remove:** Similarly, calculate the difference to find out how many cats need to be removed.
3. **Count Cats to Move:** For each box where a cat needs to be moved, we can either add a cat to an empty box and then move it to the correct position or directly move the cat from one box to another.

Here’s a revised version of the function to correctly compute the minimum number of operations:

```python
def func_1(n: int, s1: str, s2: str) -> int:
    # Count cats to add and remove
    cats_to_add = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s2[i] == '1' and s1[i] == '0')
    cats_to_remove = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s2[i] == '0' and s1[i] == '1')
    
    # The number of moves needed is the maximum of cats to add and remove
    # because each move can handle one addition and one removal
    moves_needed = max(cats_to_add, cats_to_remove)
    
    return moves_needed

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    print(func_1(n, s1, s2))
```

This approach ensures that the minimum number of operations is calculated correctly by leveraging the fact that each move can handle one addition and one removal.
