### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the position in string `b` where the character `a[i]` appears starting from position `j`. If found, it returns the position; otherwise, it returns `-1`.

2. **Main Loop Logic**: 
   - The main loop iterates through both strings `a` and `b`.
   - For each character in `a`, it calls `func_1` to find the next matching character in `b`.
   - If a match is found, it increments the indices `i` and `j` and increases the count `c`.
   - If no match is found, it breaks out of the loop.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles cases where the character `a[i]` is not found in `b[j:]` by returning `-1`.
   - The main loop correctly stops when either `i` reaches the end of `a` or `j` reaches the end of `b`.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic for finding the next character in `b` using `b[j:].find(a[i])` is correct.
   - The incrementation of `j` by the found index ensures that the next search starts from the correct position in `b`.
   - The termination condition (`break`) is correctly placed to stop the loop when no more matches are found.

5. **Output**:
   - The final count `c` is printed, which represents the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the required functionality without any logical errors.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
