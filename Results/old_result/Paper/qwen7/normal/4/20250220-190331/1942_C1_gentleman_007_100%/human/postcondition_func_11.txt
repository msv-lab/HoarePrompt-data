The function accepts two parameters: `num`, a positive integer, and `Prime_array`, a dictionary containing prime factors of `num` as keys and their respective identifiers as values. After processing, it returns a dictionary `d` where each key is a prime factor of `num` and its value is the total count of occurrences of that prime factor in the prime factorization of `num`. Additionally, the variable `num` is reduced to 1, and the `Prime_array` dictionary remains unchanged.
