n is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, m is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and l is a list of length n + 1 where each element is an empty list. The function `func_1()` is called m times, and for each call, it returns a tuple of two integers (x, y) such that 1 <= x, y <= n and x != y. The integers x and y are appended to each other's lists in the list `l`.
