The function accepts a sorted list of integers `p` and an integer `x`. It determines the correct index `i` where `x` should be inserted into `p` to keep the list sorted. If `x` is already present at index `i`, it returns `i`; otherwise, it returns `-1` indicating that `x` cannot be inserted without disrupting the sorted order.
