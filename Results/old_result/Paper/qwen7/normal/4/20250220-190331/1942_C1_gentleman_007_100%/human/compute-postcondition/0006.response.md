Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following objects:
   - `node`: This variable will take on the value of each element in `graph[ver]` during each iteration of the loop.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `q` is a deque containing the remaining elements after removing the first element.
   - `ver` is the first element that was removed from `q`.
   - `graph` remains unchanged.
   - `vis` remains unchanged except for `vis[ver]` which is set to 1.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `graph[ver]`. Therefore, the loop will start executing if `graph[ver]` is not empty.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `node` will take on the values from `graph[ver]`, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - `ver` is already set to the first element that was removed from `q`, so no adjustment is needed for `ver`.
   - `graph` and `vis` remain unchanged, but `vis[ver]` is set to 1, which is fine since this state is already given.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `graph[ver]` must contain at least one element.

**State:**
**`q` is a deque containing the remaining elements after removing the first element, `ver` is the first element that was removed from `q`, `graph` remains unchanged, `vis` remains unchanged except for `vis[ver]` which is set to 1, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one element**.
