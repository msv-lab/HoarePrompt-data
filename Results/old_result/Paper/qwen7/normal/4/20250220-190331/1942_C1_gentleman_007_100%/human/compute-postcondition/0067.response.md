The function `func_25` accepts a parameter `ver`, which is an integer representing a vertex in the graph. It also accepts a parameter `graph`, which is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices. Additionally, it accepts a parameter `vis`, which is a list or array of the same length as the number of vertices, initialized to 0, indicating whether each vertex has been visited.

Based on the input parameters, the function does not return a value directly but seems to perform some operation related to graph traversal or visiting vertices. However, since no specific return values are mentioned, we can infer that the function might modify the `vis` list to indicate the visited status of the vertices.

Functionality: **The function accepts a vertex `ver`, a graph represented as a dictionary, and a visitation status list `vis`. It marks the given vertex as visited in the `vis` list and may traverse the graph to mark all reachable vertices as visited.**
