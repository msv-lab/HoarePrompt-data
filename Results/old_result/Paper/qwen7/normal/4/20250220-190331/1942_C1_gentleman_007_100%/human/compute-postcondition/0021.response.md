Output State: All nodes that are reachable from `ver` in the graph `graph` are marked with `vis[node] = 1`, and `q` contains all these nodes that were added during the iterations of the loop. The variable `ver` retains its final value, which is the last node processed before the loop terminates.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, every node that can be reached starting from `ver` through the graph's edges will have `vis[node]` set to 1, indicating it has been visited. The deque `q` will contain all such visited nodes that were added during the loop's execution. The variable `ver` will hold the last node that was processed, and the rest of the variables (`graph` and `vis` for nodes other than those in `q`) will retain their unchanged states from the initial or previous iterations.
