The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \(n\), \(x\), and \(y\), followed by a line containing \(x\) distinct integers representing chosen vertices. It reads these inputs from the user and returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains \(x\) distinct integers representing the chosen vertices for each test case.
