The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of sides of a polygon. It returns a dictionary `d` containing the prime factorization of `n`, specifically {2: 3, 3: 3}, indicating that `n` is fully factored into its prime components. If `n` is a perfect power of a prime, the corresponding entry in the dictionary will reflect that.
