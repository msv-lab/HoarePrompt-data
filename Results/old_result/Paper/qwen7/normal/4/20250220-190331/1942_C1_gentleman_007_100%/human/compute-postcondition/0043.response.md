The loop condition is `while len(q)`, which means the loop continues as long as the length of `q` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must contain at least one element.

Given the final state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `q` is an empty list.
- `ver` is the last unvisited element that was popped from `q`.
- All elements in `graph[ver]` that were not previously visited have their corresponding `vis` flag set to 1.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `q` must not be empty. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `q` contains at least one element.

State: **`q` must contain at least one element, `ver` is the last unvisited element that was popped from `q`, and all elements in `graph[ver]` that were not previously visited have their corresponding `vis` flag set to 1**.
