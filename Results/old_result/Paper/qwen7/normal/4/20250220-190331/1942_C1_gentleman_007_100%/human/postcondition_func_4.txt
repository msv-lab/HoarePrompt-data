The function `func_5` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon and `m` represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. It returns a list `l` of length `n + 1`, where each element `l[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `m-1`) contains a list of length `m` that forms a sequence of pairs of integers returned by `func_1()`. Each pair consists of two distinct integers between 1 and `n`, and these pairs are stored in both directions in the corresponding lists within `l`.
