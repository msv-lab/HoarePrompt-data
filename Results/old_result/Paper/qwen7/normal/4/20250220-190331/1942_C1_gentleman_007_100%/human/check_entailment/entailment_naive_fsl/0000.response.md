Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. The problem requires finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the given vertices. However, the provided code does not contain any function that addresses this specific requirement. Instead, it includes a variety of utility functions that are unrelated to solving the problem.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple example:

### Example Input:
```
3
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
8 8 0
1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
4 2 0
1 3
```

### Expected Output:
```
2
6
2
```

### Analysis:
- For the first test case, with \( n = 8 \), \( x = 4 \), and \( y = 0 \), the vertices chosen are \( 1, 6, 2, 5 \). The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 2.
- For the second test case, with \( n = 8 \), \( x = 8 \), and \( y = 0 \), the vertices chosen are \( 1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8 \). The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 6.
- For the third test case, with \( n = 4 \), \( x = 2 \), and \( y = 0 \), the vertices chosen are \( 1, 3 \). The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 2.

Since the provided program does not contain any logic to calculate the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces, it cannot produce the correct output for these inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
