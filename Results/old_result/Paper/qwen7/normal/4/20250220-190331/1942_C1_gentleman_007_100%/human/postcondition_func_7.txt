The function accepts a 2D list `l` of integers and returns a 2D list `p` of size (n+2) x (m+2). Each element `p[i][j]` (for i from 1 to n+1 and j from 1 to m+1) contains the sum of all elements in the subgrid of `l` from (1,1) to (i,j). After the function executes, `i` will be `n+1` and `j` will be `m+1`, representing the dimensions of the input matrix `l`.
