Functionality: **The function accepts a vertex `ver` and a graph represented as a dictionary. It marks the given vertex as visited and traverses the graph to mark all vertices reachable from the given vertex as visited. After the function completes, all vertices reachable from the initial vertex `ver` will have their corresponding `vis[node]` set to 1, indicating they have been visited. The `deque` `q` is emptied, and the variable `ver` holds the value of the last visited vertex. The structure of the graph `graph` remains unchanged.**
