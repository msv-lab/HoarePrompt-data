Output State: **`i` is -1, `j` must be a non-zero value, `a` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `x` is the length of `a`, `b` is a list of integers representing the indices of characters in the string `a`, `y` remains 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, and `l` remains an empty list**

Explanation: The value of `i` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to -1. The values of `j`, `a`, `x`, `b`, `y`, `dp`, and `l` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
