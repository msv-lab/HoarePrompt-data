Output State: **The final state of `q` will be an empty list, and `ver` will be the last unvisited element that was popped from `q`. All elements in `graph[ver]` that were not previously visited will have their corresponding `vis` flag set to 1.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `q` will eventually become empty as each element is processed and removed. The variable `ver` will hold the last element that was popped from `q` but not yet processed (i.e., the last element in `q` before it becomes empty). All nodes that were reachable from the initial elements of `q` and were not already marked as visited (`vis[node] == 0`) will have their `vis` flags set to 1.
