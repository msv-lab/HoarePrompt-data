Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`. The loop condition is `i < k`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is an empty string.
   - `cur` is 0.
   - `cnt` is less than `n`.
   - `ans` is a string consisting of `chr(ord('a'))` repeated `cnt` times.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `tmp` is `chr(ord('a') + 1)` if `cur & 1 << 1 == 0`.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `k` does not change within the loop, so it remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` changes from 2 to 3.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - The other variables (`s`, `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, `tmp`) do not change because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`s` is an empty string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of `chr(ord('a'))` repeated `cnt` times, `i` is 3, and `tmp` is `chr(ord('a') + 1)` if `cur & 1 << 1 == 0**.
