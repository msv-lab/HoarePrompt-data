Postcondition: **After the loop has executed for all iterations, `cnt` will be the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, where each character's bit in the substring matches the corresponding bit in `cur`. `cur` will be reset to 0, and `cnt` will contain the final count. If `cnt` is less than `n`, then `tmp` will be 'e', `cnt` will be the total count of valid substrings, `cur` will be 0, `ans` will be a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each character being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times, and `k` will retain its initial state.**
