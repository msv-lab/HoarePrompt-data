You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. The string s in each test case consists only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt = 0
        
        cur = 0
        
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
        
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `cnt` will be the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, where each character's bit in the substring matches the corresponding bit in `cur`. `cur` will be reset to 0, and `cnt` will contain the final count. If `cnt` is less than `n`, then `tmp` will be 'e', `ans` will be a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each character being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times, and `k` will retain its initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes integers t, n, k, and m, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and the sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 10^6. The string s consists only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the given inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
