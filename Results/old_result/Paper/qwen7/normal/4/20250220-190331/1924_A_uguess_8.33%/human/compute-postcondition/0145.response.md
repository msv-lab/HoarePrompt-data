Output State: **`ss` is the third character of the string `s`, `cnt` is 2, `cur` is 0, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` - ASCII value of 'a'**

Explanation: The code calculates the ASCII value of the character `ss` by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from it. The other variables (`ss`, `cnt`, and `cur`) remain unchanged.
