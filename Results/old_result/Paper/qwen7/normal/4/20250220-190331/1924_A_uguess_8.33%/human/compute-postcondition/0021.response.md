Output State: **`s` is a string with at least one character, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a', `cur` is 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `cur = 0` sets the variable `cur` to 0. The values of `s`, `cur_ss`, and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial states.
