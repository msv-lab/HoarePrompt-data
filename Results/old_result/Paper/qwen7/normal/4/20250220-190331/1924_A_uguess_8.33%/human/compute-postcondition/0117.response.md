Output State: **`cnt` is 3, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'd', `ans` is 'zd', `i` is 2, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is concatenated with the value of `tmp`, which is 'd'. Initially, `ans` was 'z', so after executing `ans += tmp`, `ans` becomes 'zd'. The values of `cnt`, `cur`, `tmp`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
