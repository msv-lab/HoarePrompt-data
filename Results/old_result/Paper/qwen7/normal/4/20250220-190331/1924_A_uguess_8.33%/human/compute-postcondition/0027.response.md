Postcondition: `s` is a string with at least one character, `cur` is either `(1 << (cur_ss + 1)) - 1` or remains `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 again, and `cur_ss` is the integer value of the current character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a'. If the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` is true, then `cur` becomes `(1 << (cur_ss + 1)) - 1`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.
