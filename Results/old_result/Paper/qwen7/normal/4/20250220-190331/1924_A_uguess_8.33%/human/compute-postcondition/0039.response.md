Output State: **`s` is an empty string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is less than `n`, and `cur_ss` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code `tmp = ''` initializes an empty string `tmp`. However, this does not affect the values of `s`, `cur`, `cnt`, or `cur_ss`. Therefore, the output state retains the values of these variables as they were in the initial state, with `cur_ss` remaining undefined since `s` is still an empty string.
