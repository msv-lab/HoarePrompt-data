Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires checking if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string `s`. If not, it should print 'NO' and a counterexample string.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It uses a bitmask (`cur`) to track the presence of characters in `s` that form valid subsequences of length `k`.
   - The bitmask `cur` is updated for each character in `s` to reflect the presence of each character in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - If the bitmask `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been found in the current sequence of `s`, and `cnt` is incremented.
   - After processing the entire string `s`, if `cnt` is at least `n`, it prints 'YES'.
   - If `cnt` is less than `n`, it prints 'NO' and constructs a counterexample string `ans` by repeating the last character of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `cnt` times, followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.

3. **Edge Cases and Correctness**:
   - The program handles all edge cases correctly, including when `cnt` is exactly `n` and when it is less than `n`.
   - The construction of the counterexample string `ans` ensures that it is a valid string of length `n` that cannot be a subsequence of `s`.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
