Output State: **`cnt` is 2, `cur` is 0, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`**

Explanation: The line `cur = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `cur`. The values of `cnt` and `cur_ss` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `cnt` is still 2, `cur` is now 0, and `cur_ss` is still `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.
