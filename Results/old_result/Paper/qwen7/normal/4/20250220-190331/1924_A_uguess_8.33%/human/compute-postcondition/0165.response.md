Postcondition: `tmp` is 'a', `cnt` is the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, where each character's bit in the substring matches the corresponding bit in `cur`, `cur` is reset to 0, and `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each character being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `k` retains its initial state, `i` is 1, and the current value of `cur` satisfies `cur & 1 << i == 0`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `tmp` will be set to 'a', `cnt` will remain unchanged as it represents the count of valid substrings, `cur` will be reset to 0, `ans` will consist of `cnt` characters each being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `k` will retain its original value, and `i` will be set to 1 with the condition that `cur & 1 << i == 0` is satisfied.
