Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for ss in s:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `ss` and `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a string with at least one character.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - **`s`**: Since the loop will continue as long as there are characters left in `s`, `s` must still contain at least one character.
   - **`cur_ss`**: This variable is derived from the current character `ss` in each iteration. After the previous iteration, `cur_ss` was set to the integer value of the first character of `s` minus the integer value of `'a'`.
   - **`cur`**: This variable is not directly affected by the loop itself but rather by the loop body, which is omitted. However, since the loop continues based on the presence of characters in `s`, `cur` remains unchanged.
   - **`cnt`**: This variable is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. Therefore, it will be incremented again in the next iteration.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `s`, `cur_ss`, and `cnt`.

**Final State**:
- `s` must still be a string with at least one character.
- `cur_ss` is the integer value of the current character `ss` (which is the next character in `s`) minus the integer value of `'a'`.
- `cnt` is incremented by 1 from the previous value.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`s` is a string with at least one character, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the current character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a', `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1`, and `cnt` is incremented by 1 again**.
