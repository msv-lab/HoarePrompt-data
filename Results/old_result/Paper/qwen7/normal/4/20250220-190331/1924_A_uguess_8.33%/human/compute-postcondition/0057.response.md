Output State: **`s` is an empty string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of 'c' repeated `cnt` times followed by 'a' * (n - cnt - 1) times, `tmp` is 'c'.**

Explanation: The code appends `'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` to the string `ans`. Since `ans` was initially a string consisting of 'c' repeated `cnt` times, after appending `'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` to it, `ans` becomes a string consisting of 'c' repeated `cnt` times followed by 'a' * (n - cnt - 1) times. All other variables remain unchanged.
