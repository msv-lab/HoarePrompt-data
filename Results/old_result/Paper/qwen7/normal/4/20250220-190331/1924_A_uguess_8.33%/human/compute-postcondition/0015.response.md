Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `s` is a string with at least one character.
- `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a'.
- If `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\), then `cur` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1 and shifted left by `cur_ss` bits.

### Loop Head
The loop iterates over each character `ss` in the string `s`.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration
1. **Character `ss`:**
   - The loop variable `ss` is the current character being processed in the string `s`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `ss` is the second character of the string `s` (since it was processing the first character before).

2. **String `s`:**
   - The string `s` remains the same throughout the loop as it is not modified within the loop body.
   - Therefore, `s` still contains at least one character, and the first character of `s` is now the character that was previously the second character.

3. **Variable `cur_ss`:**
   - `cur_ss` is the integer value of the new first character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a'.
   - Since the first character of `s` changes to the next character in the string, `cur_ss` will be updated based on this new character.

4. **Variable `cur`:**
   - If `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\), it remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1 and shifted left by `cur_ss` bits.
   - For the next iteration, `cur` will be the result of the above operation applied to the new `cur_ss`.

### Updated State
- `s` remains the same but with the first character changed to the next character.
- `cur_ss` is the integer value of the new first character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a'.
- `cur` is either unchanged or updated based on the new `cur_ss`.

### Final Answer
State: **`s` is a string with at least one character, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the new first character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a', `cur` is either unchanged or incremented by 1 and shifted left by `cur_ss` bits.**

In summary:
- `s` remains the same but with the first character changed.
- `cur_ss` is updated based on the new first character.
- `cur` is updated based on the new `cur_ss`.

State: **`s` is a string with at least one character, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the new first character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a', `cur` is either unchanged or incremented by 1 and shifted left by `cur_ss` bits.**
