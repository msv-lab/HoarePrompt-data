Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tmp` is 'c'
   - `cnt` is the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`
   - `cur` is 0
   - `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each character being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`
   - `k` retains its initial state
   - `i` is 3

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

4. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 4 for the next iteration.
   - The other variables (`tmp`, `cnt`, `cur`, `ans`, and `k`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `tmp` remains 'c'
   - `cnt` remains the same
   - `cur` remains 0
   - `ans` remains the same
   - `k` remains the same
   - `i` becomes 4

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`tmp` is 'c', `cnt` is the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, `cur` is 0, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each character being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `k` retains its initial state, and `i` is 4**
