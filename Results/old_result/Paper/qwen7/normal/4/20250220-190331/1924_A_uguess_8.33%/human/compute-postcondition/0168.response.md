Postcondition: `tmp` is either 'a' or 'c', `cnt` is the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, `cur` is 0, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each character being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `k` retains its initial state, and `i` is 3 if `cur & 1 << i == 0`, otherwise `i` remains 2.
