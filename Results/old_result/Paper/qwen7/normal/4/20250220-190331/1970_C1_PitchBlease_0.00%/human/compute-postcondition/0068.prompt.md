Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(start, 0)`, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing the element `start`.
Code of the loop:
while queue:
    current, dist = queue.popleft()
    if current == target:
        return dist
    for neighbor in tree[current]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            visited.add(neighbor)
            queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, dist + 1)` for all nodes that are exactly `dist + 1` away from the `start` node, with no duplicates. The `current` node is the last node that was processed, which will be the node that has the smallest distance from the `start` node among all unvisited neighbors. The `dist` remains 0, indicating that we are still at the root level of the tree traversal. The `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited during the traversal, including the `start` node and all its direct and indirect neighbors up to the point where the loop terminates.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `queue` will contain all nodes that are directly connected to the `start` node and their respective distances (which is always 1 since they are direct neighbors). The `current` node will be the last node that was processed, and the `visited` set will include all nodes that were either the `start` node or any of its direct neighbors.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: The `current` variable will be the last node that was dequeued from the queue. The `visited` set will contain all nodes that were visited during the entire execution of the loop, starting from the initial node until no more nodes can be dequeued. The `queue` will be empty because once all reachable nodes are processed, there will be no more elements to add to it. The `dist` value will represent the shortest distance from the initial node to the `current` node.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `current` will be the last node visited, `visited` will include all nodes reachable from the start node, and `queue` will be empty since all nodes have been processed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: All neighbors of the nodes starting from the initial node have been visited, and the `queue` contains tuples of all unvisited neighbors along with their distances from the initial node. The `visited` set includes all nodes that have been processed, ensuring no node is visited more than once. The `current` variable holds the last node that was processed before the loop terminated, which could be the target node or any other node that has all its neighbors visited.

This means that the algorithm (likely a breadth-first search) has explored as far as possible from the initial node, and the `queue` now contains information about the shortest path distances to all reachable nodes.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
