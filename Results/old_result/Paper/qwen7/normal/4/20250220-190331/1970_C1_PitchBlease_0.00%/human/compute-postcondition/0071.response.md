The function `bfs` accepts two parameters: `start` and `target`. `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, and `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree. The function returns 0 in Case_1 and Case_2, the shortest distance from the initial node to the current node in Case_3, and -1 in Case_4. Therefore, the functionality of the function `bfs` is to perform a breadth-first search from the `start` node to find the shortest path to the `target` node, returning 0 if the target is not found, the shortest distance if the path is found, and -1 if an error occurs or the conditions are not met.
