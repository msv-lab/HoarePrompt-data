Postcondition: `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor. If the `neighbor` is not in `visited`, then `queue` will contain a new element `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, and the `neighbor` will be added to `visited`. If the `neighbor` is already in `visited`, then no changes are made to `queue` or `visited`, and `current` remains the same.
