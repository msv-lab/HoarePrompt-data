Postcondition: `current` is the first element that was in the queue before `popleft()` was called. If `neighbor` is not in the `visited` set, then `neighbor` is added to the `visited` set, and `queue` now contains a tuple of (`neighbor`, `dist + 1`). If `neighbor` is already in the `visited` set, no changes occur.
