Output State: The `current` variable will be the last node that was dequeued from the queue. The `visited` set will contain all nodes that were visited during the entire execution of the loop, starting from the initial node until no more nodes can be dequeued. The `queue` will be empty because once all reachable nodes are processed, there will be no more elements to add to it. The `dist` value will represent the shortest distance from the initial node to the `current` node.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `current` will be the last node visited, `visited` will include all nodes reachable from the start node, and `queue` will be empty since all nodes have been processed.
