Output State: The queue contains tuples of all nodes that can be reached from the starting node, with their respective distances from the starting node. The `visited` set contains all nodes that have been processed. No node appears more than once in the `visited` set, and each tuple in the queue represents a node and its distance from the starting node. The `current` variable holds the current node being processed, which will eventually be the target node when the algorithm completes.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the `queue` will contain all reachable nodes from the starting node, along with their distances, and the `visited` set will include all nodes that have been explored. The `current` variable will hold the final node that was processed, which could be the target node if it was reached, or the last node in the queue if the target was not found.
