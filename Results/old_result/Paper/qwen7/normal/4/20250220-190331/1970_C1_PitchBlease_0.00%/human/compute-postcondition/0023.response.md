Output State: The `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, dist + 1)` for all nodes that are exactly `dist + 1` away from the `start` node, with no duplicates. The `current` node is the last node that was processed, which will be the node that has the smallest distance from the `start` node among all unvisited neighbors. The `dist` remains 0, indicating that we are still at the root level of the tree traversal. The `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited during the traversal, including the `start` node and all its direct and indirect neighbors up to the point where the loop terminates.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `queue` will contain all nodes that are directly connected to the `start` node and their respective distances (which is always 1 since they are direct neighbors). The `current` node will be the last node that was processed, and the `visited` set will include all nodes that were either the `start` node or any of its direct neighbors.
