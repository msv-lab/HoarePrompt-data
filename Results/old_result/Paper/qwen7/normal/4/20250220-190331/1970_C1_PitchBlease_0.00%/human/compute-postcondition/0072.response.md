Functionality: **The function `bfs` accepts two parameters: `start` (an integer representing the starting node) and `target` (an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree). It performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is found, it returns the shortest distance; otherwise, it returns -1.**
