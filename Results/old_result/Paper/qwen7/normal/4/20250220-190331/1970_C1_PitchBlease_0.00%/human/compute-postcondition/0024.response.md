The loop condition is based on the `queue` variable. For the loop to execute one more time, the `queue` must not be empty. After the previous iteration, the `queue` contains tuples of the form `(neighbor, dist + 1)` for all nodes that are exactly `dist + 1` away from the `start` node, with no duplicates. Since `dist` remains 0, the `queue` contains direct neighbors of the `start` node.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, the `queue` must not be empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that there are still elements in the `queue`.

State: **The `queue` is non-empty, the `current` node is the last node that was processed, the `dist` remains 0, the `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited during the traversal, including the `start` node and all its direct and indirect neighbors up to the point where the loop terminates.**
