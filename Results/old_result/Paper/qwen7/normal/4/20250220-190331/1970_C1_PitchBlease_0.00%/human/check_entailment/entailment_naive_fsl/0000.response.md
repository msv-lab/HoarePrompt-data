Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the game rules for the given tree structure. Specifically, the program calculates the distance from the starting node to each leaf using BFS and checks if either distance is even. However, this approach does not account for the optimal strategy of the players. 

To illustrate, consider the following case:

Input:
```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5
```

In this case, the tree is structured such that the stone starts at node 5, which is a leaf. The only possible move is to node 4, which is also a leaf. Since both leaves are at an odd distance from the starting node (5), the game should result in a loss for Ron (the first player), as Hermione can always force a win by mirroring Ron's moves.

However, the current implementation incorrectly returns "Hermione" without considering the optimal play strategy. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for this specific case.
