Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `current` is the first element that was in the queue before `popleft()` was called. If `current` is equal to `target`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `current` is the first element that was in the queue before `popleft()` was called, `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor. If `neighbor` is not in the `visited` set, then `neighbor` is added to `visited` and `(neighbor, dist + 1)` is appended to the `queue`. If `neighbor` is already in the `visited` set, no changes are made to the `queue` or `visited` set.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `current` is the first element that was in the queue before `popleft()` was called. If `neighbor` is not in the `visited` set, then `neighbor` is added to the `visited` set, and `queue` now contains a tuple of (`neighbor`, `dist + 1`). If `neighbor` is already in the `visited` set, no changes are made to `current`, `queue`, or `visited`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `current` is the first element that was in the queue before `popleft()` was called, `neighbor` is the next element in the adjacency list of `current`, `queue` now contains tuples of (`neighbor`, `dist + 1`) and `neighbor`, `visited` now contains `neighbor`. This is true if and only if `neighbor` was not already in `visited`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
