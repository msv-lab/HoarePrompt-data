Output State: **The `queue` is now empty (since `popleft()` was called), `current` is the first element that was in the queue before `popleft()` was called, `dist` is 0, the `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited during the traversal, including the `start` node and all its direct and indirect neighbors up to the point where the loop terminates.**

In this output state, the `queue` has been updated by removing the first element (`current, dist`), making it empty. The `current` node is now the node that was previously at the front of the queue, and `dist` remains 0. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
