The function repeatedly prompts the user to input pairs of integers until the input does not consist of exactly two elements. For each valid input, it collects these pairs into a list. After the loop breaks, it returns this list of pairs. The variables `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged and are not included in the return.
