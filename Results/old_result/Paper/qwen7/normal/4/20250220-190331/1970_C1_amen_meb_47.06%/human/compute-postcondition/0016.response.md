Output State: **`numbers` is now ['num1', 'num2', ['num1', 'num2']], `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n.**

Explanation: The code appends the list `['num1', 'num2']` to the `numbers` list. Initially, `numbers` contains `['num1', 'num2']`. After appending `['num1', 'num2']` to itself, `numbers` becomes `['num1', 'num2', ['num1', 'num2']]`. The values of `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged.
