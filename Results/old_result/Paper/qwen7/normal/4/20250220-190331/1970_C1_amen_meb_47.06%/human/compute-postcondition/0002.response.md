Output State: **`numbers` is an empty list, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `nums` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `nums = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. Since the initial state specifies that `numbers` is an empty list, it does not get updated. The variable `n` remains unchanged as the code does not interact with it. The variables `t`, `u`, and `v` also remain unchanged. The only new variable `nums` is created and initialized as a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
