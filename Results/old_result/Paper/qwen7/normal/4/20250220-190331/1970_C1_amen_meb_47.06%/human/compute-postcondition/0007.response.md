Output State: **`numbers` is an empty list, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `nums` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `num1` is the integer obtained from `int(nums[0])`, `num2` is the integer obtained from `int(nums[1])**.

The code assigns the value of the second element in the list `nums` (converted to an integer) to the variable `num2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
