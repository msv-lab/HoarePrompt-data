Output State: **`numbers` is now ['num1', 'num2'], `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `nums` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `num1` is the integer obtained from `int(nums[0])`, `num2` is the integer obtained from `int(nums[1])`, `nums` is updated to a list of strings from the input.**

Explanation: The code `nums = input().split()` takes user input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The original values of `numbers`, `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and `nums` (as defined by the initial state) remain unchanged except for `nums`, which is updated to a new list of strings from the user input. The values of `num1` and `num2` are also updated to integers obtained from the first and second elements of the new `nums` list, respectively.
