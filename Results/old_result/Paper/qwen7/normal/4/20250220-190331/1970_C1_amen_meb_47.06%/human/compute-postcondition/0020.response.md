Postcondition: `numbers` is now ['num1', 'num2', ['num1', 'num2']], `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and either the length of `nums` is not 2, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or there is no else part specified.
