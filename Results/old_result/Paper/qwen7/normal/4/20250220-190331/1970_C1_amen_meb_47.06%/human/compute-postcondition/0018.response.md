Output State: **`numbers` is now ['num1', 'num2', ['num1', 'num2']], `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `nums` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `nums = input().split()` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `nums`. The initial values of `numbers`, `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged. The new variable `nums` is created and populated with the split input.
