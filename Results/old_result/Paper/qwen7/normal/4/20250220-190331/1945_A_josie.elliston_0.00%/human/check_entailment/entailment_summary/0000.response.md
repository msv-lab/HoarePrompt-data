Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate participants based on their preferences. Introverts need individual tents, extroverts need tents with exactly two others, and universals can share tents with anyone.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals combined. It ensures that if extroverts cannot form complete groups of three (i.e., `extroverts % 3 != 0`), there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots. If not, it returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to satisfy everyone's preferences.
   - **func_2**: This function uses `func_1` to calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. It then adds the number of introverts, who each need their own tent. If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate everyone, and `-1` is returned.

3. **Verification**:
   - For the given examples, let's verify the logic:
     - **Case 1 (`1 2 3`)**: 1 introvert needs 1 tent, 2 extroverts and 1 universal can share 1 tent, and the remaining 2 universals can share another tent. Total: 3 tents.
     - **Case 2 (`1 4 1`)**: 1 introvert needs 1 tent, 4 extroverts need 2 tents (2 extroverts per tent), but there's no universal to pair with the last extrovert. Thus, it's impossible, and `-1` is returned.
     - **Case 3 (`1 4 2`)**: Similar to Case 2, 1 introvert needs 1 tent, 4 extroverts need 2 tents, but there's no universal to pair with the last extrovert. Thus, it's impossible, and `-1` is returned.
     - **Case 4 (`1 1 1`)**: 1 introvert needs 1 tent, 1 extrovert and 1 universal can share 1 tent. Total: 2 tents.
     - **Case 5 (`1 3 2`)**: 1 introvert needs 1 tent, 3 extroverts need 1 tent, and the remaining 2 universals can share another tent. Total: 3 tents.
     - **Case 6 (`19 7 18`)**: 19 introverts need 19 tents, 7 extroverts and 18 universals can share 7 tents (each tent has 3 people). Total: 26 tents.
     - **Case 7 (`0 0 0`)**: No participants, so 0 tents are needed.
     - **Case 8 (`7 0 0`)**: 7 introverts need 7 tents.
     - **Case 9 (`0 24 0`)**: 24 extroverts need 8 tents (each tent has 3 people).
     - **Case 10 (`1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`)**: 1 billion introverts need 1 billion tents, 1 billion extroverts and 1 billion universals can share 333333333 tents (each tent has 3 people). Total: 1333333333 tents.

All these cases match the expected outputs, and the logic in both functions correctly implements the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
