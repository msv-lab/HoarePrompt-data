Output State: **`L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from `L`, `n` is the first element of `L`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`.**

Explanation: The code `M.sort()` sorts the list `M` in ascending order. The values of `L`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. After sorting, `M` contains the same integers as `L`, but in sorted order.
