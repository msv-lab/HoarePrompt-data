Output State: **`M` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `k` is the third element of `M`, `n` is the first element of `M`, `m` is the second element of `M`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `n` is the length of `N`, and `cost` remains unchanged, `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of `L` to `n`, the second element of `L` to `m`, and the third element of `L` to `k`. Since `L` is another name for `M`, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated accordingly. The other variables (`N`, `q`, `cost`, and `t`) remain unchanged.
