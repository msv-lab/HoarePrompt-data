You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
        
        m = min(m, k)
        
        M.sort()
        
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        
        N = M[:q]
        
        n = len(N)
        
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            w = N.pop()
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = mu * w
            n = len(N)
            cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu
        
        print(cost)
        
        continue
        
    #State: Output State: All the necessary lists and variables will retain their final values after the loop completes its execution. Specifically, `t` will be the total number of iterations the loop ran, which is provided initially. For each iteration `_` in the range of `t`, the following will hold true:
    #
    #- `L` will be a list of integers entered by the user for that specific iteration.
    #- `M` will be a sorted version of `L`.
    #- `n` will be the length of the list `N`.
    #- `m` will be the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`.
    #- `k` will be the third element of `L`.
    #- `q` will be the ceiling value of `k / m`.
    #- `N` will be a sublist of `M` containing the first `q` elements of `M`.
    #- `cost` will be the calculated cost based on the conditions specified in the code, either as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` or `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.
    #
    #After all iterations, the final values of `t`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, and `cost` will reflect the results of the last iteration of the loop. The `continue` statement ensures that the loop proceeds to the next iteration without altering the current values of the variables. Thus, the output state will show the culmination of all individual iteration calculations, with `cost` being the sum of costs from all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of inputs including an integer `t` (such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (with given constraints), and a list `a` of `n` integers (each between 1 and 10^9). It does not return a value directly but processes these inputs according to their constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
