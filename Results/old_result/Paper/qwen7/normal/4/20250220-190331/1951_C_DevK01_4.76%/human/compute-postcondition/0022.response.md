Output State: **`L` is updated to a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from `L`, `n` is the length of `L`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is not yet determined, `N` is not yet determined, and `cost` is not yet determined.**

Explanation: The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `L`. The other variables (`M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, and `cost`) remain unchanged in terms of their definitions but their values are yet to be determined based on the new value of `L`.
