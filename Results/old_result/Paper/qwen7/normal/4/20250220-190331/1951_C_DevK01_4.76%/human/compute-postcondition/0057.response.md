The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, and the `continue` statement does not affect the variables outside of a loop, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The `continue` statement itself does not alter the values of `M`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `N`, `q`, `cost`, `w`, `mu`, or any other variables.

Output State: **`M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from user input, `k` is the third element of `M`, `n` is the length of the list `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second element of `M` and `k`, `N` is a list of the first `q` elements of `M`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, if `n * m == k`, then `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, otherwise `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `n` is updated to the new length of `N` after popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`. The `continue` statement is executed, but it does not change any variable values.**
