Output State: **`mu` is equal to `k - (n - 1) * m`, `m` is the first element of `L`, `n` is the second element of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `L` minus the last element, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `n` is the length of `N`.**

Explanation: The variable `mu` is assigned the value of `k - (n - 1) * m`. The values of `m`, `n`, `k`, `N`, `q`, and the relationship between `n` and `N` remain unchanged from the initial state.
