Output State: **`M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from user input, `k` is the third element of `M`, `n` is the length of the list `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second element of `M` and `k`, `N` is a list of the first `q` elements of `M`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `n` is updated to the new length of `N` after popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w`**.

In this output state, the `cost` variable has been calculated as `mu * w`. All other variables retain their previous values and relationships as described in the initial state.
