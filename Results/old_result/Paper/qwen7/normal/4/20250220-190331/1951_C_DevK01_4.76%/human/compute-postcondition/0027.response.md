Output State: **`m` is the first element of `L`, `n` is the second element of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is not yet determined, and `cost` is not yet determined.**

Explanation: The code calculates `q` as the ceiling value of `k / m`. Since `k` is the third element of the list `L` and `m` is the first element of the list `L`, `q` is computed as `math.ceil(k / m)`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `q`, `N`, and `cost`) are updated accordingly.
