Output State: **`m` is now the smaller of `m` and `k`, `n` is the first element of `L`, `m` is the second element of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is not yet determined, `N` is not yet determined, and `cost` is not yet determined.**

Explanation: The line `m = min(m, k)` updates the value of `m` to be the minimum between its current value and `k`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `q`, `N`, and `cost`) remain unchanged.
