Output State: **`m` is the first element of `L`, `n` is the second element of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `n` is the length of `N`, and `cost` remains unchanged, `t` must be greater than 0, `L` is updated to a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers replaces the existing list `L`. All other variables (`m`, `n`, `k`, `N`, `q`, `cost`, `t`) remain unchanged with their respective values or conditions.
