Output State: **`L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from `L`, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a sublist of `M` containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `n` is an integer representing the length of list `N`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, and `n * m` is not equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `w = N.pop()` pops the last element from list `N`. Since `N` was a sublist of `M` containing the first `q` elements, after popping, `N` now contains one less element. The popped element is stored in `w`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
