Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices `M`.
3. It sorts the list `M` to facilitate the calculation of the minimum cost.
4. The logic for calculating the cost involves determining how many full batches of `m` tickets can be purchased (`q = int(math.ceil(k / m))`) and then breaking down the remaining tickets into smaller groups.
5. The program handles the case where the number of tickets to be bought (`k`) is exactly divisible by `m` and the case where it is not.
6. The cost calculation seems to follow the rules specified in the problem statement, including the increase in ticket prices after purchasing a certain number of tickets on a particular day.
7. The program prints the cost for each test case and continues to the next without returning any value, which is acceptable for this type of problem.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and matches the expected behavior as described in the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
