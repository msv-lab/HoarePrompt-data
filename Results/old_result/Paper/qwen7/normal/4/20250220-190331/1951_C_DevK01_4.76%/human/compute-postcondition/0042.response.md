Output State: **`M` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `m` is the first element of `M`, `n` is the second element of `M`, `k` is the third element of `M`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `n` is the length of `N`, and `cost` remains unchanged, `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `M = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and converts them into a list of integers. This list is assigned to the variable `M`. The values of `m`, `n`, and `k` are updated to be the first, second, and third elements of `M`, respectively. The list `N` is updated to contain the first `q` elements of `M`, where `q` is calculated as the ceiling value of `k / m`. The length of `N` is stored in `n`. The variables `cost` and `t` remain unchanged.
