### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. The beauty is maximized by arranging the array such that the positive differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements.
   - It then sorts the array and prints the sorted array as a string.

3. **Sorting and Beauty Calculation**:
   - Sorting the array will arrange the elements in non-decreasing order.
   - When the array is sorted, the differences between consecutive elements will be minimized because the largest element will be next to the smallest element, leading to smaller positive differences or larger negative differences.
   - This approach does not maximize the beauty of the array as required.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the beauty, we should place the largest element at one end and the smallest element at the other end, then alternate placing the remaining elements in descending and ascending order.
   - For example, if the array is `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, the optimal arrangement would be `[100, 90, 80, 54, 43]` or `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program before and after the function execution.
   - The program reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by sorting the array, and prints the sorted array.
   - However, the sorted array does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array as required by the problem statement.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It simply sorts the array, which does not maximize the beauty as required.
