Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an integer input by the user, `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The variable `ar` is mentioned in the initial state but is not modified by the given code snippet. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `t` and `ar`, while updating `n` to reflect the new input value.
