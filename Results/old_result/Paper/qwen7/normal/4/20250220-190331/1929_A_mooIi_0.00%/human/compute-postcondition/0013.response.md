Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(' '.join(ar))
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `ar` is a list of strings where each string represents an integer from the input, and the list is sorted.
2. The `join` method is used to concatenate the elements of the list `ar` with a space (' ') as the separator.
3. The result of `' '.join(ar)` will be a single string where all the elements of `ar` are concatenated together with spaces in between.

Since the exact values of `n` and the specific integers in the input are not provided, we cannot determine the exact content of `ar`. However, we know that `ar` contains sorted strings of integers.

Therefore, the output will be a single string with all the integers from the input, sorted and separated by spaces.

Output: **a single string containing all integers from the input, sorted and separated by spaces**
