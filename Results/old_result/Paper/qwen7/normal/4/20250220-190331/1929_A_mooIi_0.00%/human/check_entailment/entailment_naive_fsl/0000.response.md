Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The program attempts to sort the array and then join the elements as strings, which does not address the requirement to maximize the beauty of the array by rearranging its elements.

To achieve the correct solution, we need to sort the array in such a way that the difference between consecutive elements is maximized. Specifically, we should place the smallest element first and the largest element last, and then arrange the remaining elements in ascending order. This ensures that the differences \(a_i - a_{i-1}\) are maximized.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ar.sort()
        max_beauty = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            max_beauty += ar[i] - ar[i-1]
        print(max_beauty)


```

This corrected program calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and then summing the differences between consecutive elements, which aligns with the problem description.
