Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) (indicating the number of test cases), followed by an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. It sorts these integers, converts them to strings, and prints the sorted list for each test case. After processing all test cases, the variable \( t \) is set to 0, indicating that no more test cases remain.**
