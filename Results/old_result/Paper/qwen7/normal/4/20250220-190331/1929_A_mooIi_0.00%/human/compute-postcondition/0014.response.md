Output State: The loop will continue to execute until all `t` test cases have been processed. After all iterations, for each test case, `n` will be an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `ar` will be a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input for each test case. The final output will consist of the sorted integers for each test case, printed one per line.

In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will no longer be relevant as it will have reached 0 after processing all test cases. For each test case, `n` will hold the last value of `n` read from the input, and `ar` will contain the last sorted list of strings from the input integers for that test case. The output will be a series of lines, each containing the sorted integers from the corresponding test case.
