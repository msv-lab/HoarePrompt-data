Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to a string, sorts them, and assigns the sorted list of strings to `ar`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `ar` changes to a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input.
