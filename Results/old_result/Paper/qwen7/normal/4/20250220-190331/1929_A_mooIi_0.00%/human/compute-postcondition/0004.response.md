Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(' '.join(ar))
```

Let's break down the process:

1. **`ar` List**: 
   - `ar` is a list of strings where each string represents an integer.
   - Since `ar` contains the sorted integers from the input, if the input was a list of integers, `ar` would contain those integers converted to strings and sorted in ascending order.

2. **Joining Strings**:
   - The `join` method is used to concatenate the elements of the list `ar` into a single string, with each element separated by a space.
   - For example, if `ar = ['1', '3', '2']`, then `' '.join(ar)` would result in the string `"1 3 2"`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement outputs the resulting string to the console.

Since the exact values of `ar` are not specified, we can only describe the general form of the output based on the precondition.

Output: **a space-separated string of the sorted integers from the input, where each integer is represented as a string**
