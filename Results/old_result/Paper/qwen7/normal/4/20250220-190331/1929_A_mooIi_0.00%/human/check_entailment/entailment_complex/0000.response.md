Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. However, the function simply sorts the array and prints the sorted array, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty.

To maximize the beauty, we should arrange the elements such that the largest possible difference is achieved between consecutive elements. This can be done by sorting the array and then placing the smallest element at the beginning and the largest at the end, while alternating the placement of the remaining elements to maximize the differences.

Here's how the function should be corrected:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the array
        ar.sort()
        
        # Initialize the result
        beauty = 0
        
        # Calculate the beauty
        for i in range(1, n):
            beauty += abs(ar[i] - ar[i-1])
        
        print(beauty)
```

This corrected function sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements. 

Given the initial description and the annotated program, the provided function does not achieve the intended purpose of maximizing the beauty of the array. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
