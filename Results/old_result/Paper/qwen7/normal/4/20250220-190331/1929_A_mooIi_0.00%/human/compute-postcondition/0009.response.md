Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(' '.join(ar))
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `ar` is a list of strings where each string represents an integer. Since these strings are sorted, they represent the sorted integers from the input.
2. The `join` method is used to concatenate the elements of the list `ar` into a single string, with each element separated by a space.
3. The resulting string is then printed.

Therefore, the output will be a single line of text where the sorted integers from the input are concatenated with spaces between them.

Output: **a single line of space-separated integers (where the integers are the sorted values from the input)**
