Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program sorts the array and prints the sorted array as a string, but the problem requires calculating the maximum possible beauty of the array after rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).

The current implementation does not rearrange the elements to maximize this sum; instead, it simply sorts the array and prints it. Sorting the array does not necessarily maximize the beauty, especially since the beauty depends on the relative order of adjacent elements.

To correctly solve the problem, we should arrange the array such that the largest element is paired with the smallest element to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones. One effective strategy is to place the largest element next to the smallest, the second largest next to the second smallest, and so on.

Given this analysis:

Correctness: **False**
