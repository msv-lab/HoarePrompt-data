Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the expression `range(int(input()))`. This means that the loop will run for as many times as the user inputs as an integer.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as the user inputs a valid integer. The loop variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) is incremented with each iteration, but it does not affect the other variables directly.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the user must input a valid integer. Since the loop condition is based on the user input, the only thing that needs to change is the value of the input that the user provides.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the user input, which is represented by the loop variable `_`.

However, since the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the other variables directly, the states of `t`, `n`, and `ar` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input.**
