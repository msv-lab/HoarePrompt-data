Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will hold the integer value entered by the user. The value of `t` remains unchanged as the input was not used to modify it.
