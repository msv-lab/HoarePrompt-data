Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the functions defined in the program do not address this specific logic.

The functions defined (such as `func_1`, `func_2`, etc.) are utility functions for reading input but do not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem. There is no function that implements the core algorithm to count the valid pairs based on the given conditions.

A correct implementation would involve iterating through all possible pairs (a, b) within the given ranges and checking if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Since the provided code does not include this logic, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
