Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns the sum of \((n + j) // (j * j)\) for all \(j\) from 2 to the final value of \(i\) that satisfies \(i > m\) or \(i * i > n + i\), minus 1.**

This means the function calculates the sum of the expression \((n + j) // (j * j)\) for each integer \(j\) starting from 2 up to the largest integer \(i\) that is greater than \(m\) or whose square is greater than \(n + i\), then subtracts 1 from this sum before returning it.
