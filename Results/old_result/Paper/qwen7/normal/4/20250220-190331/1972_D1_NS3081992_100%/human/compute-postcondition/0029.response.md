Functionality: **The function processes a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` indicating processed nodes, an integer `da` as a key in `d`, and a list `rank` initialized to zeros. It returns either 1 or `tmp + 1`. If the length of `d[da]` is 1, it returns 1 immediately. Otherwise, it recursively updates `tmp` to the minimum value among the results of calling itself for each node in `d[da]` that hasn't been processed, then sets `rank[da - 1]` to `tmp + 1` and all elements in `processing` to 0 before returning `tmp + 1`.**
