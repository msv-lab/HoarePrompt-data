Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes an unspecified number of test cases. For each test case, it takes three integers: t, n, and m, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. It does not return any specific value but processes these integers according to their constraints.**
