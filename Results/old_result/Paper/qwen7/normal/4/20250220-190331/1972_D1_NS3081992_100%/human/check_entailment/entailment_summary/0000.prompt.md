Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function reads an integer from standard input within the range 1 to 10^4 and returns it.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from standard input, where both `n` and `m` are within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6, and returns these two integers.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function reads a line of input from the standard buffer, splits it into two integers, and returns them as a list. Specifically, it returns a list containing the values of 'n' and 'm' for each test case, where both 'n' and 'm' are integers within the specified range.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function accepts a positive integer `rows_number` (where 1 ≤ rows_number ≤ 10^4) and returns a list containing the result of calling another function `func_3()` exactly `rows_number` times.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing whitespace, and returns the modified line.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function reads a line of input from the standard input, removes any trailing whitespace, and decodes it from bytes to a string before returning it. This process ensures that the returned value is a clean string suitable for further processing.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function reads a space-separated string of integers from the user input and returns a list containing these integers.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a non-negative integer `rows` and generates a list containing the results of calling `func_7()` for each row in the range from 0 to `rows-1`. The final state of the program is a list of these results.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function reads and processes input from the standard input stream. Specifically, it reads the first line to determine the number of test cases \( t \), and then reads \( t \) additional lines, each containing two space-separated integers \( n \) and \( m \). The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` accepts no parameters and returns an integer input provided by the user.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function reads input from the standard input, splits it into two parts, and returns them as a list of strings. The list contains the values of `n` and `m`, which are separated by spaces.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function processes a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` indicating processed nodes, an integer `da` as a key in `d`, and a list `rank` initialized to zeros. It returns either 1 or `tmp + 1`. If the length of `d[da]` is 1, it returns 1 immediately. Otherwise, it recursively updates `tmp` to the minimum value among the results of calling itself for each node in `d[da]` that hasn't been processed, then sets `rank[da - 1]` to `tmp + 1` and all elements in `processing` to 0 before returning `tmp + 1`.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which are positive integers with specific constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and b ≠ 0). It returns either (1, 0, a) if `b` is 0, or (y, x - a // b * y, g) where `x` and `y` are calculated based on the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function processes a list of integers `a` and updates the integer `k` based on the values in `a` compared to `m`. If `k` is non-negative after processing all elements in `a`, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function takes no parameters and returns the sum of \((n + j) // (j * j)\) for all integers \(j\) from 2 to the largest integer \(i\) such that \(i \leq m\) and \(i * i \leq n + i\), minus 1.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function processes an unspecified number of test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_10()` to determine the number of iterations. Then, for each iteration, it calls `func_15()` to get a positive integer, which is printed to the standard output followed by a newline. After processing all test cases, the standard output contains multiple lines, each with a positive integer generated by `func_15()`, with the number of lines corresponding to the sum of the values returned by `func_10()` across all test cases.
