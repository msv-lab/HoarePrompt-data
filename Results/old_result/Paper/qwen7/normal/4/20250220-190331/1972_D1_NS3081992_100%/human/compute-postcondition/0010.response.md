Output State: **`i` is 3, `m` must be at least 4, `n` must be at least 6, `ans` is 3**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 3, `m` must be at least 4, `n` must be at least 6, and `ans` is `(n + 2) // 4`. Given `n` must be at least 6, let's assume the minimum value for `n`, which is 6. So, `ans` is `(6 + 2) // 4 = 8 // 4 = 2`.

The code updates `ans` by adding `(n + i) // (i * i)` to `ans`. Substituting the values, we get `(6 + 3) // (3 * 3) = 9 // 9 = 1`. So, `ans` becomes `2 + 1 = 3`.

The values of `i`, `m`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the final state is `i` is 3, `m` must be at least 4, `n` must be at least 6, and `ans` is 3.
