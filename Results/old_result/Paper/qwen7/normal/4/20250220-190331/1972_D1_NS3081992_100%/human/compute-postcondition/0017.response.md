Postcondition: **Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `k` will be updated by subtracting `m - a[j]` for each `j` from `0` to `n-1` if `a[j] < m`, and `n` must have been greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Additionally, the current value of `k` is greater than or equal to 0.**
