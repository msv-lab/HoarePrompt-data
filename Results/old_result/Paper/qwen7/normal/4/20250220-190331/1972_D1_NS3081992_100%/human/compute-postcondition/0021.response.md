The function `func_14` accepts four parameters: `a`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. 

- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= n and 0 <= m.
- `k` is an integer.

The function returns either 1 or -1 based on certain conditions, but the specific conditions are not detailed here. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_14` is to accept a list of integers `a`, two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`, and return either 1 or -1 based on some internal logic that is not specified.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`, and returns either 1 or -1.**
