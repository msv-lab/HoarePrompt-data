Reasoning:
1. **Function Analysis**: The program includes several functions, but the core logic seems to be implemented in `func_15` and `func_16`. `func_15` calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \(n\) and \(m\), and `func_16` processes multiple test cases using `func_15`.

2. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Function `func_15`**: This function correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \(n\) and \(m\). It iterates through possible values of \(i\) and checks the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The implementation appears to be correct based on the provided comments.

4. **Function `func_16`**: This function processes multiple test cases by calling `func_15` for each test case. It correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_15` and writing the result to the standard output.

5. **Input/Output Handling**: The input handling functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, etc.) are not directly relevant to the correctness of the solution but are necessary for reading input. They seem to handle the input correctly according to the problem statement.

Given that `func_15` correctly calculates the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\), and `func_16` correctly processes multiple test cases using `func_15`, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
