### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Function Summaries and Their Roles:**
   - `func_16`: This function processes an unspecified number of test cases. It calls `func_10` to determine the number of iterations and then calls `func_15` for each iteration. The output of `func_15` is printed.
   - `func_15`: This function calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) for given n and m, and returns the result.

2. **Core Logic in `func_15`:**
   - The function `func_15` takes no parameters directly from the input but instead uses predefined constants and logic to compute the number of valid pairs.
   - The logic in `func_15` does not match the problem description. Specifically, it does not check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Utility Functions:**
   - The utility functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, etc.) are used for reading input, but they do not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem.

Given these observations, the program does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. The function `func_15` does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the necessary logic to solve the problem as described.
