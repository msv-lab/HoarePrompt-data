### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not implement the solution to the problem as described. The function `func_15` attempts to solve the problem but uses an incorrect approach. Specifically, the logic inside `func_15` does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), and the loop conditions and variable usage are also incorrect.

The suggested correction in the original assessment provides a more accurate implementation of the solution. It iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the required condition using the `gcd` function. This approach ensures that the correct number of valid pairs is counted.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code is indeed incorrect, and the suggested correction is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.
