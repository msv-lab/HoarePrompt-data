Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Given Code Analysis:
The code provided includes several utility functions but does not contain the main logic to solve the problem. Let's focus on the relevant parts:

- **Function 15**: This function is intended to solve the problem but seems incomplete and incorrect for the given problem statement.
- **Function 16**: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case, printing the result.

### Function 15 Analysis:
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

#### Issues with `func_15`:
1. **Incorrect Logic**: The function does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is not related to the problem constraints.
3. **Variable Initialization**: The variable `ans` is incremented without considering the actual pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition.

### Correct Solution Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    return count_valid_pairs(n, m)

def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        print(func_15())
```

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
