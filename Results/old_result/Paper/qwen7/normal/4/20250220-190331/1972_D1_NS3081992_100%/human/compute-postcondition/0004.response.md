Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(func_10()):`. The variables involved in the loop head are:
   - The result of `func_10()`, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `func_15()` returns a positive integer. This means that `func_10()` returned some positive integer value, say `k`, which determined the number of iterations in the loop.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the value returned by `func_10()` must still be a positive integer, and it should be decremented by 1 from the previous value since one iteration has already completed.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- Since `func_15()` returns a positive integer, we know that `func_10()` originally returned a positive integer.
- After one iteration, the value returned by `func_10()` should be decremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this adjustment.

**State: **`func_15()` returns a positive integer, and `func_10()` returns a positive integer that is one less than the previous value.**
