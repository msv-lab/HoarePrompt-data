Output State: **Postcondition: `tmp` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for every `di` in `d[da]`, and all elements in `processing` are set to 0.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `tmp` will have been updated to the minimum value it attains during any of the iterations, where each iteration calls `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for every `di` in `d[da]`. Additionally, since the loop sets `processing[di - 1]` to 1 and then back to 0 for each `di` in `d[da]`, by the end of the loop, all elements in `processing` will be reset to 0.
