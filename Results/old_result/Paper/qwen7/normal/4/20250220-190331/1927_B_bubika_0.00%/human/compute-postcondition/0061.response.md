Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a test case defined by a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), where for each test case, it receives a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i < n). The function does not return anything explicitly but processes these inputs according to the given constraints.**
