Output State: **`b[x]` is increased by 1, `r` is increased by `a[x]`.**

Explanation: The code `b[x] += 1` increments the value of `b[x]` by 1. The value of `x` is determined by `b.index(i)`, which means `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`. The value of `r` is increased by `a[x]`, which is the value at index `x` in the list `a`. The states of the other variables (`b`, `i`, `x`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
