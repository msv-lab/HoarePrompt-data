Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 zeros.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    r = ''
    for i in s:
        x = b.index(i)
        r += a[x]
        b[x] += 1
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `b` is a list where each element's count has been incremented by the number of times it appears in `s`. The variable `r` is a string that concatenates characters from list `a` based on the indices determined by the elements in `s`, with each character repeated according to how many times its corresponding value in `b` was incremented during the loop iterations.

In simpler terms, `b` will show how many times each integer from `s` appeared, and `r` will be a string constructed by repeating characters from `a` as many times as their corresponding integers in `b` were incremented.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `r` will be a string where each character corresponds to the cumulative sum of specific elements in `a` based on the counts of each integer in `s`. The list `b` will contain the counts of each integer in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `t` is an input integer less than N, `s` is a list of integers with all elements processed, `r` is the string `a[x] + a[x] + a[x] + ... + a[x]` (where `a[x]` is repeated as many times as there are elements in `s`), `i` is the last element of the list `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `s`, `b[x]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `s`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `r` will contain a concatenated string where each element from the list `s` is repeated according to its count in `b`, and `b` will have been incremented for each occurrence of each element in `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
