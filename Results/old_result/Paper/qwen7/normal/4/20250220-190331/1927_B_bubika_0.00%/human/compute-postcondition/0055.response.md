Output State: **`t` is an input integer less than N, `s` is a list of integers with at least one element, `r` is the string `a[x] + a[x] + a[x]`, `i` is the third element of the list `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `s`, `b[x]` is incremented by 1 twice.**

Explanation: The code `b[x] += 1` increments the value of `b[x]` by 1. Since it is mentioned that `b[x]` is incremented by 1 twice, the value of `b[x]` is incremented by 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
