Output State: **All elements in `prog_cities` are either 1 or the absolute difference between consecutive elements in `cities`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n-1`. The variable `back` will be the coordinate of the city just before the current one (or -99999999999999999999 if it's the first city), and `forward` will be the coordinate of the city just after the current one (or 999999999999999999 if it's the last city). For each city (except possibly the first and last), `prog_cities[i]` will be set to 1 if the next city is closer than the previous city, or to the absolute difference between the next and current city otherwise. This results in `prog_cities` being filled with 1s where the next city is closer and with the differences where the previous city was closer.
