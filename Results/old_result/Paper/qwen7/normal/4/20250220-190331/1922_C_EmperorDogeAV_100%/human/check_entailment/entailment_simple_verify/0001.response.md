### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires calculating the minimum cost to travel between two cities on a number line. The cost depends on whether you choose to move to the closest city or any other city.
   - The closest city to each city \(i\) is uniquely defined and can be found by comparing the distances to the previous and next cities.

2. **Key Components of the Solution**:
   - `func_1` computes the distance to the closest city for each city.
   - `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` store these distances in forward and backward directions, respectively.
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are prefix sums of `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`, used to quickly calculate the sum of distances for any subarray.
   - Queries are answered using these prefix sums.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates through each city and calculates the distance to the closest city by comparing distances to the previous and next cities.
   - This logic seems correct for determining the closest city. However, there is a critical issue with the implementation:
     - The variable `forward` is initialized to a very large value (`999999999999999999`). This initialization ensures that the first city will always have its closest city as the second city, but it does not handle the last city correctly.
     - Similarly, the variable `back` is initialized to a very small value (`-99999999999999999999`). This initialization ensures that the last city will always have its closest city as the second-to-last city, but it does not handle the first city correctly.
   - These initializations lead to incorrect results for the first and last cities in the list.

4. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are correctly computed as prefix sums of `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`.

5. **Query Handling**:
   - The code correctly handles the queries by using the appropriate prefix sum arrays based on the direction of travel (forward or backward).
   - The logic for determining the minimum cost is sound, but it relies on the correctness of the `func_1` function.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles edge cases where the city indices might be reversed in queries, ensuring the correct prefix sum is used.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the solution is correct. The issue lies in the initialization of `forward` and `back` in the `func_1` function, which leads to incorrect results for the first and last cities. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
