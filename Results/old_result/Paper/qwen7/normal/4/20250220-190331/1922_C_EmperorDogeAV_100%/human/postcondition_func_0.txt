The function accepts a list of integers `cities` representing the coordinates of cities in ascending order and an integer `m` (though `m` is not used in the function). It returns a new list `prog_cities` where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between consecutive elements in the original `cities` list. For each city coordinate in `cities`, if the absolute difference between the current city and the next city is smaller than the absolute difference between the current city and the previous city, the corresponding element in `prog_cities` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to the absolute difference between the current and next city coordinates.
