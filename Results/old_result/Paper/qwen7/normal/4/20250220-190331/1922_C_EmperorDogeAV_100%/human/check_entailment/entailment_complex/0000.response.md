Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of coins needed to travel between two cities, with the ability to move to the closest city for 1 coin or directly to another city for the distance cost.
2. The provided code attempts to solve this by calculating the "closest city" information and using prefix sums to quickly answer queries.
3. The `func_1` function calculates whether the next or previous city is closer for each city, setting the value in `prog_cities` accordingly.
4. The main part of the program correctly uses these values and prefix sums to compute the minimum cost for each query.
5. However, there are a few issues:
   - The `func_1` function should consider the closest city correctly but does not handle the case when the closest city is exactly one step away.
   - The main loop should handle the reverse case properly, but the reverse operation is not correctly implemented.
   - The logic for determining the closest city in `func_1` is flawed because it does not always correctly identify the closest city due to the way distances are compared.

Given these points, the provided solution is incorrect because it does not accurately determine the closest city for each position, leading to incorrect results for the queries.

Correctness: **False**
