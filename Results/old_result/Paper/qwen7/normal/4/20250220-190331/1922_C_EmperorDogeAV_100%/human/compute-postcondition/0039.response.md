Output State: **`back` is either `cities[i - 1]` if `i > 0`, or remains `-99999999999999999999`. `forward` is `cities[i + 1]`. `prog_cities[1]` remains `|cities[2] - cities[1]|`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `forward` to `cities[i + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
