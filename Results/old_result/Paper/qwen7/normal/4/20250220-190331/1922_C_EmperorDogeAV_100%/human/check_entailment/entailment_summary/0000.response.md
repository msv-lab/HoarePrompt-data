Reasoning:
1. The provided program aims to solve the problem by calculating the minimum cost to travel between two cities based on their closest city properties.
2. The `func_1` function correctly identifies the closest city property for each city in the list. If the next city is closer than the previous city, it sets the value to 1; otherwise, it sets it to the absolute difference between the current city and the next city.
3. After processing the cities and their closest properties, the program calculates prefix sums for both forward and backward directions. These prefix sums help in quickly calculating the minimum cost to travel between any two cities.
4. The main loop processes each query by using the prefix sums to find the minimum cost efficiently.
5. The logic in the main part of the program seems to correctly utilize the prefix sums to compute the minimum cost for each query based on whether the start city index is less than or greater than the end city index.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the solution based on the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
