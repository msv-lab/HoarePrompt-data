Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `back` is `cities[i - 1]`, `forward` is 999999999999999999.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `cities[i - 1]` to the variable `back`. The value of `i` is greater than 0, so `i - 1` is a valid index for the list `cities`. The value of `forward` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
