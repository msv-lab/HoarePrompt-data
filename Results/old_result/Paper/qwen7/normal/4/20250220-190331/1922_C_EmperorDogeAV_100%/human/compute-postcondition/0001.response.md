Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` is the loop counter, which starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n` is the length of the `cities` list.

3. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, the first condition is that `i` should be 0.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n - 1` after the first iteration.

5. **Initial State of `n`**: The value of `n` is the length of the `cities` list. Since the loop runs until `i < n - 1`, `n` must be at least 2 (because if `n` is 1 or less, `n - 1` would be 0, and the loop wouldn't run).

6. **Final Adjusted State**:
   - `i` should be 0 initially.
   - `n` must be at least 2 to ensure the loop runs at least once.

Given these points, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2**.
