### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires calculating the minimum cost to travel between two cities on a number line. The cost depends on whether you choose to move to the closest city or any other city.
   - The closest city to each city \(i\) is defined as the city \(j\) such that the distance \(|a_i - a_j|\) is minimized.

2. **Key Components of the Solution**:
   - `func_1` computes the distance to the closest city for each city.
   - `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` store these distances in forward and backward directions, respectively.
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are prefix sums of `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`, used to quickly calculate the sum of distances for any subarray.
   - Queries are answered using these prefix sums.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates through each city and calculates the distance to the closest city by comparing distances to the previous and next cities.
   - This logic seems correct for determining the closest city.
   - However, there is a critical issue with the implementation of `func_1`. The function should return the index of the closest city, not the distance. The current implementation returns the distance, which is incorrect because the problem requires finding the index of the closest city.

4. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are correctly computed as prefix sums of `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`.

5. **Query Handling**:
   - The code correctly handles the queries by using the appropriate prefix sum arrays based on the direction of travel (forward or backward).
   - However, the queries cannot be answered correctly because `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` contain distances, not indices of the closest cities.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution does not handle edge cases where the city indices might be reversed in queries, but this is not the primary issue here.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` returns distances instead of indices of the closest cities. This means that the `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` lists are not correctly computed, leading to incorrect results for the queries.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the mistake in `func_1` which returns distances instead of indices of the closest cities.
