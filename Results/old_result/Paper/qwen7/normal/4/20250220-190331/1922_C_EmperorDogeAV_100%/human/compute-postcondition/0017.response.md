Output State: **`i` is 0, `back` is -99999999999999999999, `forward` is the value of `cities[1]`, `prog_cities[0]` is the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[0]`**.

This means that the value of `i` remains 0, `back` remains -99999999999999999999, and `forward` remains the value of `cities[1]`. Additionally, `prog_cities[0]` is now updated to be the absolute difference between `forward` (which is `cities[1]`) and `cities[0]`.
