Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are assigned the values from the input split, `i` is `x + 2` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())` takes four integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The variable `i` is defined as `x + 2`, where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, but since no previous iteration context is provided, we keep it as `x + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
