Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
- Eve removes numbers to maximize Bob's wins.
- We need to find the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The input consists of four integers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s respectively.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`:
     - This part calculates the number of pairs (i.e., even counts) among the numbers.
     - Each pair contributes to making the XOR result zero because \(x \oplus x = 0\).
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`:
     - This checks if the sum of the remainders of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s modulo 2 equals 3.
     - If it does, it means there are exactly two odd counts among 1s, 2s, and 3s, which also contributes to making the XOR result zero.

3. **Combining Results:**
   - The expression `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` gives the total number of ways to make the XOR result zero by removing numbers optimally.

### Correctness Check:
- The logic correctly accounts for the pairs and the specific condition involving the remainders of 1s, 2s, and 3s.
- It ensures that Bob wins whenever the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero, which is the goal.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

**Correctness: True**
