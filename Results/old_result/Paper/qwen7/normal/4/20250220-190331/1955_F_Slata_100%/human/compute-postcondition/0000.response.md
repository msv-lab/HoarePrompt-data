Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`. 

3. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Initially, `i` is set to 0 because the loop starts from 0.

4. **Determine the value of `int(input())`**: The value of `int(input())` is determined by the user input. However, we know from the problem statement that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

5. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute at least once, `i` must be less than `int(input())`. Since `i` starts at 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Given the constraints, `int(input())` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute at least once.

**State:**
- `i` is 0
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0

Since `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we can summarize the required state as follows:

**State:**
**`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
