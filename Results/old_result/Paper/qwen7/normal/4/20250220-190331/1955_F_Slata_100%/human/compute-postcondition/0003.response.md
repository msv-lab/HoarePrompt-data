Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in this loop head are:
   - `i`: The loop variable.
   - The result of `int(input())`: This determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers entered by the user.
   - The loop has just completed an iteration, but we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. However, we know that the loop will continue if `i` is less than the value of `int(input())`.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i`: After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. So, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The value of `int(input())` remains the same unless the user enters a new value, but since we are only concerned with the loop condition, we assume it stays the same.

Given these points, let's formulate the state for the next iteration:

- `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote it as `x`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers entered by the user, `i` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.
