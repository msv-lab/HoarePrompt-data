Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500\), and it is assigned the value of `int(input())`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` from 1 to `n + 1` (inclusive).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to start, `n` must be at least 1 because the loop runs from 1 to `n + 1`.
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 1 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `i` must be 1.

Given the constraints on `t` and `n`, the final state before the loop starts should reflect these adjustments.

**State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1**.
