Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be at least 1

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Value of `i`:** It is explicitly given that `i` is 2.
2. **Value of `range(n, 0, -1)`:** This generates a range of numbers starting from `n` down to 1, with a step of -1. Since `n` is at least 1, the range will include `n`, `n-1`, ..., 1.

So, if `n` is 1, the range will be `[1]`.
If `n` is 2, the range will be `[2, 1]`.
If `n` is 3, the range will be `[3, 2, 1]`.

The `*` operator unpacks this range into separate arguments for the `print` function.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output:
- `1` (the first argument)
- `2` (the value of `i`)
- followed by the unpacked range of numbers from `n` down to 1.

Since `n` is at least 1 but its exact value is not specified, we need to represent it in a general form.

Output: **1 2 n n-1 ... 1** (where `n` is at least 1)
