Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). This means `t` can take any integer value within this range, but its specific value is not explicitly stated.
- `n` must be at least 1, meaning `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is 1.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `2` is a constant integer.
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `*range(n, 0, -1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from `n` down to 1 with a step of `-1`.

Given these details, the `print` statement will output:
- The number `2`
- The value of `i`, which is `1`
- All numbers from `n` down to `1` (inclusive), separated by spaces.

Since `n` is at least 1, the sequence generated by `range(n, 0, -1)` will include at least the number `1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2 1 n n-1 ... 1** (where `n` is a positive integer at least 1)
