Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` must be at least 3 but no explicit value is given for `n`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `1` is directly printed as 1.
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `*range(n, 0, -1)` will generate a range starting from `n` down to 1, with a step of -1. Since `n` must be at least 3, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n`, which is 3, for the sake of this example. If `n` were any larger, the sequence would simply include more numbers.

So, if `n` is 3, `range(n, 0, -1)` generates the sequence `[3, 2, 1]`. When unpacked with `*`, it will print these values separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1 3 3 2 1**
