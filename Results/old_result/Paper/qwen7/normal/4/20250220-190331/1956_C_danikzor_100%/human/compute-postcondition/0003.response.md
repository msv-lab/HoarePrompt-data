Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `i` is 1.

We need to determine the output of the following code snippet:
```python
print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Value of `i`:** It is explicitly stated that `i` is 1.
2. **Value of `range(n, 0, -1)`:** This generates a range of numbers starting from `n` down to 1 with a step of -1. For example, if `n` is 3, then `range(n, 0, -1)` would generate `[3, 2, 1]`.

Given these details, the `print` statement will output the following:
- The number `1`.
- The value of `i`, which is `1`.
- All the numbers generated by `range(n, 0, -1)`, separated by spaces.

Since `n` is at least 1, let's assume the simplest case where `n` is 1 for clarity. In this case, `range(1, 0, -1)` will not generate any numbers because the start value is greater than the stop value. Therefore, the output will only include the numbers `1` and `1`.

Output: **1 1**
