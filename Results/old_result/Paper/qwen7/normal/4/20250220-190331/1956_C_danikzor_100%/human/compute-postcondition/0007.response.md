Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be at least 1

We need to evaluate the print statement:
```python
print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

Let's break it down:

1. The first argument to `print` is `2`.
2. The second argument is `i`, which is explicitly given as 2.
3. The third argument is `*range(n, 0, -1)`, which unpacks the range object into individual arguments. This means it will print all numbers from `n` down to 1, decreasing by 1 each time.

Since `n` must be at least 1, let's consider the simplest case where `n` is 1 (the minimum value it can take):

- If `n` is 1, then `range(n, 0, -1)` will generate the sequence `[1]`.
- When unpacked, this becomes `1`.

So, the print statement will output:
- `2`
- `2` (from `i`)
- `1` (from the range)

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2 2 1**
