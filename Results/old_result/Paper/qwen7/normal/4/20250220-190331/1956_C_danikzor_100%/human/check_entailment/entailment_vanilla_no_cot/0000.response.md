Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is incorrect for calculating the maximum sum of the matrix. Additionally, performing the same permutation twice (once for rows and once for columns) will not maximize the sum of the matrix as intended. The problem requires setting specific values in the matrix to maximize its sum, not just applying permutations repeatedly.

The correct approach would involve setting the matrix such that each element \(a_{i,j}\) is equal to \(i + j - 1\). This can be achieved with a combination of type 1 and type 2 operations, ensuring that the sum is maximized. The provided solution does not achieve this and instead uses an incorrect formula and redundant operations.
