Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The solution starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.
   - It then calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix and the number of operations needed.
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum sum is \( n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1) // 6 \). This formula seems incorrect because the maximum sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix where each element can be any permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \) is actually \( n^2 \times n = n^3 \).
   - The number of operations is set to \( 2n \), which is within the allowed limit.
   - Two operations are performed for each row:
     - A Type 1 operation is performed on each row, setting the elements of the row to a descending permutation (from \( n \) to 1).
     - A Type 2 operation is performed on each row, setting the elements of the columns corresponding to that row to a descending permutation (from \( n \) to 1).

3. **Checking the Correctness**:
   - The formula for the maximum sum is incorrect. The correct maximum sum is \( n^3 \), not \( n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1) // 6 \).
   - However, the operations described in the code will indeed fill the matrix with values from 1 to \( n^2 \) in a way that maximizes the sum, as each element will be set to a value from 1 to \( n \) exactly once.

Given these points, although the formula for the maximum sum is incorrect, the operations described in the code will correctly maximize the sum of the matrix.

Correctness: **False**
