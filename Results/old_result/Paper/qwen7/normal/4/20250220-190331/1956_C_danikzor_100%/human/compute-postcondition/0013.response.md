Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case has an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). Additionally, the sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5. For each test case, the function processes `t` and `n` and returns a result based on these values.**

This means the function is designed to handle a series of test cases, each containing two integers `t` and `n`, and it processes these values according to some unspecified logic, ensuring that the constraints on `t`, `n`, and the sum of `n^2` are respected. The exact nature of the processing and the return value for each test case are not detailed here.
