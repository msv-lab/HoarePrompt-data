You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where for each case, it reads counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. It then calculates the sum of the floor division of each number by 2 and prints this sum for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the calculated sum for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Specifically, the program calculates `cnt` by adding the counts of ones, twos, and threes divided by 2, but this approach does not account for the bitwise XOR operation and the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the parity of the counts of ones, twos, and threes. The key observation is that Bob wins if the final XOR of the sequence is zero. To achieve this, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining sequence remains non-zero until the last few numbers, allowing Bob to win.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_bob_wins(p, q, r, s):
    total = p + q + r + s
    # Calculate the number of ones, twos, and threes
    ones = p
    twos = q
    threes = r
    
    # Calculate the number of fours
    fours = s
    
    # Determine the maximum number of Bob's wins
    if ones % 2 == 0 and twos % 2 == 0 and threes % 2 == 0:
        return min(ones, twos, threes)
    else:
        return min(ones, twos, threes) + 1

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p, q, r, s = a
        print(max_bob_wins(p, q, r, s))

func()
```

This corrected program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering the parity of the counts of ones, twos, and threes.
