Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `x` and the list `a`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - `x` is the iterator variable used in the loop, but its initial value is not specified.
   - `a` is a list of integers, and its initial state is given as a list of integers converted from space-separated inputs.

3. **Postconditions and Loop Execution**:
   - The postcondition states that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This condition is not directly related to the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted here.
   - The variable `cnt` is initialized to 1, which is also not directly related to the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted here either.

4. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. If `a` is empty, the loop will not execute.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in the list `a`, the list `a` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `x` will take the value of each element in the list `a` during each iteration, starting from the first element.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `a` must have at least one element.

Given this analysis, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element**.
