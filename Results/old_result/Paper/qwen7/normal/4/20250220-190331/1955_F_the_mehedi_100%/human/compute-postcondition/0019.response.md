Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers converted from space-separated inputs, and `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in the updated list `a`**.

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from input and converts it into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This list replaces the original `a`. The value of `cnt` remains unchanged because the code does not modify `cnt`; it only updates the list `a`. Therefore, `t` and `cnt` retain their initial conditions, while `a` is now a list of integers derived from the input.
