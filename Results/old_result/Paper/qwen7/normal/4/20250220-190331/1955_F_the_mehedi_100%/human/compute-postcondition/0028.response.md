Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `x` is the next element in the list `a`.
   - `cnt` is increased by the floor division of `x` by 2.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a` using the variable `x`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `x` is the next element in the list `a`.
   - `cnt` is increased by the floor division of `x` by 2.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be the next element in the list `a`.
   - Since `a` is a list, and `x` is an element of `a`, the list `a` must still have at least one element for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The state of `a` remains the same because it must still have at least one element.
   - `x` becomes the next element in the list `a`.
   - `cnt` is increased by the floor division of `x` by 2, but since this operation happens inside the loop, its value will be updated accordingly in the next iteration.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `a` must still have at least one element.
- `x` becomes the next element in the list `a`.
- `cnt` will be updated in the next iteration based on the new value of `x`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the next element in the list `a`, `cnt` will be updated in the next iteration based on the new value of `x`**
