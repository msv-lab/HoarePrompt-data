Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is `0`, `b` is `p[b] - 1` repeated for each iteration, `s` is `p[s] - 1` repeated for each iteration, `bm` is the cumulative sum of `max(bm, a[b] * (k - i) + bp)` for each iteration, `sm` is the cumulative sum of `max(sm, a[s] * (k - i) + sp)` for each iteration, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `k` will be `0` as it decreases by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `0`. The variables `b` and `s` will be updated in each iteration according to the given rules. The variable `bm` will store the cumulative maximum of `a[b] * (k - i) + bp` across all iterations, and `sm` will store the cumulative maximum of `a[s] * (k - i) + sp` across all iterations. `sp` will hold the sum of `a[s]` for all iterations, and `bp` will hold the sum of `a[b]` for all iterations.
