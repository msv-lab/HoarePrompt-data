Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input values for each test case.
2. The program initializes the starting positions for Bodya (`b`) and Sasha (`s`) and adjusts them to be zero-indexed.
3. The program calculates the initial scores for Bodya (`sp`) and Sasha (`bp`).
4. The program enters a loop that simulates the game for `k` turns. In each iteration, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha to their respective `p[x]` positions, adjusts the scores accordingly, and ensures that the maximum possible scores are accumulated.
5. After the loop, the program compares the final scores of Bodya (`bm`) and Sasha (`sm`) and prints the appropriate result.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic seems to be correctly implemented. The program handles the game simulation for each test case and outputs the correct result based on the final scores.

Correctness: **True**
