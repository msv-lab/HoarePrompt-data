Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is `k - 1`, `b` is `b`, `s` is `s`, `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * (k - 1) + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * (k - 1) + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`**

Explanation:
- `bp` is incremented by `a[b]`, so `bp` becomes `a[b] + bp`.
- The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged except for `k` which is decremented by 1. However, since `k` is used in the expressions for `bm` and `sm`, it is updated to `k - 1`.
