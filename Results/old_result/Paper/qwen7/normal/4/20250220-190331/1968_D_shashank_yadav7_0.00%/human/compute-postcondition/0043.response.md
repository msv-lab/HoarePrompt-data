Output State: `i` is `n`, `k` is `-n-1`, `b` is `p[p[...]] - 1` (where the number of nested `p[]` is `n-1`), `s` is `p[p[p[...]] - 2]` (where the number of nested `p[]` is `n-1`), `bm` is the sum of multiple `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` terms, `sm` is the sum of multiple `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` terms, `sp` is `a[s] + (a[s] + ... + a[s])` (where the number of `a[s]` added is `n`), `bp` is `a[b] + (a[b] + ... + a[b])` (where the number of `a[b]` added is `n`).

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating the loop has completed `n` iterations.
- `k` will be `-n-1`, as it starts at some positive value and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `-n-1`.
- `b` and `s` will be deeply nested indices derived from the list `p`, with `b` being updated `n-1` times and `s` being updated `n-1` times.
- `bm` accumulates the maximum values of `a[b] * k + bp` over all iterations.
- `sm` accumulates the maximum values of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations.
- `sp` accumulates the value of `a[s]` `n` times.
- `bp` accumulates the value of `a[b]` `n` times.
