Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n - 1`
- `k` is `0`
- `b` and `s` are updated according to the loop's logic
- `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` from the last two iterations
- `bm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[b] * k + bp` from the last two iterations
- `sm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[s] * k + sp` from the last two iterations
- `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`

The print statement is simply `print('Draw')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'Draw'`, the output will be exactly that string.

Output: **Draw**
