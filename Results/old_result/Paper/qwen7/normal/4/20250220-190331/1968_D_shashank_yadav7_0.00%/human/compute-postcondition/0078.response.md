Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`
   - `b` is `p[b] - 1`
   - `i` is less than `n`
   - `n` is a non-negative integer
   - `k` is equal to 0
   - `s` is `p[s] - 1`
   - `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`
   - `sp` is `sp + a[s]`
   - `bp` is `bp + a[b]`

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again if `i` is incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `bm` remains unchanged because it is not directly affected by the loop increment.
   - `b` remains unchanged because it is not directly affected by the loop increment.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `s` remains unchanged because it is not directly affected by the loop increment.
   - `sm` remains unchanged because it is not directly affected by the loop increment.
   - `sp` remains unchanged because it is not directly affected by the loop increment.
   - `bp` remains unchanged because it is not directly affected by the loop increment.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is equal to 0, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`**
