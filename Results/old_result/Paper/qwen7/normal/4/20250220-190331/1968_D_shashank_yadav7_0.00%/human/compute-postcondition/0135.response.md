Output State: **`bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 0, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`**

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by `a[s]`. Since `a[s]` is a specific value from the list `a`, `sp` now holds the sum of its previous value and `a[s]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
