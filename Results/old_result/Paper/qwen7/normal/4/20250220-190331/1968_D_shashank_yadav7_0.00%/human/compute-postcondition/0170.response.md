Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a test case defined by the variables t, n, k, P_B, P_S, p, and a. It returns a result based on the given conditions and inputs.**

- The function processes a test case where `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, it takes `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S` as positive integers such that \(1 \leq P_B, P_S \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
- It also takes `p` as a permutation of length `n`.
- Additionally, it takes `a` as an array of positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\).

The function returns a result based on the processing of these inputs according to the specified conditions.
