Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp) + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + (a[s] + sp)`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b]`, `sp` is updated by adding `a[s]` to its current value.**

Explanation:
- The code `sp += a[s]` updates the value of `sp` by adding `a[s]` to its current value.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
