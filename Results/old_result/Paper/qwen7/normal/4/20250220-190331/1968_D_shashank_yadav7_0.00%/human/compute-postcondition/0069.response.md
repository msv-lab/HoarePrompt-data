Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, or `k`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the code, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the `break` statement indicates that we would exit the most internal loop or conditional if one were present.
