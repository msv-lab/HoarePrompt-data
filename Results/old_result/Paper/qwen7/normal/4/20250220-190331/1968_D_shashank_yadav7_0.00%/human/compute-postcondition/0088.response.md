Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is `k - 1`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`**

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by `a[s]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `sp` which is the original value of `sp` plus `a[s]`.
