Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is `k - 1`, `b` is `b`, `s` is `s`, `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * (k - 1) + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * (k - 1) + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`**.

Explanation: The code `k -= 1` decrements the value of `k` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state of `k` is `k - 1`, while `i`, `n`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` retain their original values or expressions as given in the initial state.
