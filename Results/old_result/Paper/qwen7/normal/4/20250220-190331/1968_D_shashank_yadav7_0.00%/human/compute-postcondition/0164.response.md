Based on the initial state provided:

- `bm` is set to `3 * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, and it is mentioned that `bm` is now less than `sm`.
- `b` is calculated as `p[p[p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1`.
- `i` is `-1`.
- `k` is `-n`.
- `s` is calculated as `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`.
- `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + a[s]`.
- `sp` is updated to `a[s] + sp + a[s] + a[s]`.
- `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b] + a[b] + a[b]`.

The `print('Sasha')` statement simply prints the string `'Sasha'`.

Output: **Sasha**
