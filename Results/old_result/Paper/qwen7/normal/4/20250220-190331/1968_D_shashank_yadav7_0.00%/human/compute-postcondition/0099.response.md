Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is `k - 1`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `b` is unchanged, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * (k - 1) + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` adds the value of `a[s]` to `sp`. Since `sp` was previously `a[s] + sp`, the new value of `sp` becomes `a[s] + a[s] + sp`, which simplifies to `a[s] + sp + a[s]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
