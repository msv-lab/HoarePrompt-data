Output State: **`bm` is `3 * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1 - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is `-2`, `s` is `p[s] - 1 - 1`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + a[s]`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b] + a[b]`, and `sm` is updated by adding `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` to its current value.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm` by adding `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
