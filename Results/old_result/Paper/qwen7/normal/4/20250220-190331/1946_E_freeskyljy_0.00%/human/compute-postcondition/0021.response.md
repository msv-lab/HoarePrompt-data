Output State: **`i` is `L[-1] - 1`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers obtained from the input split, `L` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input split using `map(int, input().split())`, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, and either `M1 <= 1` or `M2 <= 1` or `L[-2] != R[1]`, `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, `M1` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns `L[-1] - 1` to the variable `i`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is now updated based on the last element of the list `L` reduced by 1.
