Output State: **`nums_left` is decreased by 3, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`, and `cur` is `cur - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `cur -= 1` decreases the value of `cur` by 1. The other variables (`nums_left` and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Since `nums_left` was already decreased by 2, it is now decreased by an additional 1, making it decreased by 3 in total. The value of `i` is still `L[-1] - 1`, and `cur` is now `cur - 1`.
