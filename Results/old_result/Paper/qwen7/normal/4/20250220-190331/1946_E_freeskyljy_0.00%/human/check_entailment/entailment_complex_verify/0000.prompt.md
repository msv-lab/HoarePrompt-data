You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

        #
        #Explanation: After the loop runs until `i` is 0, `nums_left` will be 0 because it is decremented by 2 in each iteration and starts from `L[-1] - 1`. Since `nums_left` is 0, the multiplication inside the loop body no longer affects `ans`. Therefore, `ans` becomes 0 after all iterations.

        #
        #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `N` because it starts from `R[0] + 1` and increments by 1 until it reaches `N`. For each iteration, `nums_left` decreases by 1, so after `N - R[0] - 1` iterations, `nums_left` will be `N - R[0] - (N - R[0]) - 1`. The value of `cur` will be `R[0] + (N - R[0])` because it increments by 1 for each iteration unless `i` equals `R[cur]`, but since `i` will eventually reach `N`, `cur` will not increment any further. `ans` remains 0 as there is no condition within the loop that changes its value from 0.
    #State: Postcondition: `ans` is 0, `nums_left` is `-1`, `cur` is `N`, `i` is `N`. 
    #
    #Explanation: Given the initial state where `ans` is 0 and `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, the if statement checks if `M2 > 1`. If true, the loop runs until `i` becomes `N`, decrementing `nums_left` and incrementing `cur` and `i` accordingly. Since `i` starts from `R[0] + 1` and goes up to `N`, `nums_left` will be decremented by `N - R[0] - 1` iterations, resulting in `nums_left` becoming `-1`. The value of `cur` will be `N` because it increments by 1 for each iteration and does not change once `i` reaches `N`. The value of `i` will also be `N` after the loop completes. `ans` remains 0 as there is no condition within the loop that changes its value.
    return ans
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values for `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, and `R` and checks several conditions. If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a combination value based on `N` and the last element of `L`. It then iterates through `L` and `R` to modify the combination value `ans` under certain conditions. Finally, the function returns 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where the last prefix maximum index and the first suffix maximum index do not match, but also does not account for all possible configurations of prefix and suffix maximums.

For instance, consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
4 2 2
1 3
3 4
```
- Expected Output: `2` (Permutations: `[1, 3, 2, 4]` and `[2, 3, 1, 4]`)
- Program Output: `0`

The program checks if the last prefix maximum index (`L[-1]`) matches the first suffix maximum index (`R[0]`). If they do not match, it returns `0`. However, this check alone is insufficient to determine the number of valid permutations. The program also needs to ensure that the positions of other prefix and suffix maximums are correctly handled.

In the given example, the program incorrectly returns `0` because `L[-1]` (which is `3`) does not equal `R[0]` (which is `3`), but the actual number of valid permutations is `2`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it fails to handle all potential cases correctly.
