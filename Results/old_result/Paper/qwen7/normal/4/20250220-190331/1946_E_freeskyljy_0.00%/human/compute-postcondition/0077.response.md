The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, `i` was originally `R[1] + 3`, so after incrementing, `i` becomes `R[1] + 4`. The other variables (`ans`, `nums_left`, `cur`, and the condition involving `i` and `R[cur]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 4`, `cur` is either `R[0] + 4` or `R[0] + 3`, `i` is `R[1] + 4`, and `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` becomes either `R[0] + 4` or `R[0] + 3`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, and `cur` remains either `R[0] + 3` or `R[0] + 2`.**
