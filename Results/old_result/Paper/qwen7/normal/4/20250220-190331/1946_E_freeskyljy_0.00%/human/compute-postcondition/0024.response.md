Output State: **`i` is `L[-1] - 2`, `L[-1]` must be greater than 2, and the current value of `i` is equal to `L[cur - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `cur -= 1` decrements the value of `cur` by 1. Given that initially `i` was equal to `L[cur]`, after decrementing `cur`, `i` is now equal to `L[cur - 1]`. The conditions that `L[-1]` must be greater than 2 and that `i` is `L[-1] - 1` before the operation remain unchanged.
