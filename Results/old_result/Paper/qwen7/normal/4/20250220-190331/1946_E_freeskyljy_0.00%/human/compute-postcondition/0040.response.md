Output State: **`nums_left` is decreased by 2, `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left % MOD)`, `i` is `L[-1] - 2`, and `L[-1]` must be greater than 3.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` modulo `MOD`. The values of `nums_left` and `L[-1]` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The value of `i` remains as `L[-1] - 2`. The condition that `L[-1]` must be greater than 3 also remains valid.
