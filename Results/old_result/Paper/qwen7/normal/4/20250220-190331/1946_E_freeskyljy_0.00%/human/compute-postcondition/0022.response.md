Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the conditions under which it can execute the first time.

The loop condition is:
```python
while i > 1:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The state right before the loop is:
- `i` is `L[-1] - 1`
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers obtained from the input split
- `L` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer
- `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input split using `map(int, input().split())`
- The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`
- Either `M1 <= 1` or `M2 <= 1` or `L[-2] != R[1]`
- `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`
- `cur` is `M1 - 2`
- `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`
- `M1` is greater than 1

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i > 1` must be true. Given that `i` is `L[-1] - 1`, we need to ensure that `L[-1] - 1 > 1`.

Let's break down the conditions:
- `L[-1]` is the last element of the list `L`.
- Since `i = L[-1] - 1`, we need `L[-1] - 1 > 1`, which simplifies to `L[-1] > 2`.

We do not need to adjust any other states because the loop condition only depends on `i`, and `i` is directly derived from `L[-1]`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `L[-1]` must be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is `L[-1] - 1` and `L[-1]` must be greater than 2**
