Output State: **The program returns 0**

This is because the initial state shows that `ans` is 0. The if statement checks if `M2 > 1`, but the code snippet does not show the value of `M2`. Even if `M2 > 1` is true, the loop would run, but the only operations inside the loop are updating `nums_left`, `cur`, and `i`. However, since `ans` is not modified within the loop or outside of it, its value remains 0. Therefore, the program returns 0.
