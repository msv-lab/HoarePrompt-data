Output State: **`ans` is 0, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`, `cur` is either `R[0] + 2` or 1, `i` is either `R[1] + 1` or `R[0] + 2`, and `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `i` was either `R[1]` or `R[0] + 1`. After incrementing, `i` becomes `R[1] + 1` or `R[0] + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
