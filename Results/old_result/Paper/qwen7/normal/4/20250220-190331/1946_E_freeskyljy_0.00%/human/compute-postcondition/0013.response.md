Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers obtained from the input split, `L` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input split using `map(int, input().split())`, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, and either `L[0] == 1` or `R[0] == N`. Additionally, `M1` is greater than 1, `M2` is greater than 1, and the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`.
