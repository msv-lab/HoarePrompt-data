Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- The loop condition is `i > 1`.
- The loop body is omitted.
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `nums_left` has been decreased by 2.
  - `i` is set to `L[-1] - 1`.
  - `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD` if `i` does not equal `L[cur]`.

### Loop Head Variables
The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

### Loop Condition
The loop continues as long as `i > 1`.

### Current State
- `nums_left` is decreased by 2.
- `i` is `L[-1] - 1`.
- `ans` is updated based on the condition `i != L[cur]`.

### Analysis
To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` must be greater than 1 at the start of the next iteration. 

Given that `i` is currently set to `L[-1] - 1`, we need to ensure that `L[-1] - 1 > 1`. This means `L[-1]` must be greater than 2.

### Adjusted State
We need to ensure that `L[-1]` is greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing. No other states need to be adjusted since they do not affect the loop condition directly.

### Final Answer
State: **`nums_left` is decreased by 2, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`, and `L[-1]` must be greater than 2**
