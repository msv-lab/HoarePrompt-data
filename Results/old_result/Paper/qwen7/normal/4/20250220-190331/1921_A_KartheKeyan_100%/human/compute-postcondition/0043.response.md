Output State: **`x` is an integer from the fourth input split, `y` is an integer from the fourth input split, `coord` is an empty list, `i` is 4, `p1` is the squared distance between the second and the first point in `coord`, `p2` is the squared distance between the fourth and the third point in `coord`, `res` is the square root of `p1 * p2`, and `n` is 3.**

Explanation: The line `coord = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `coord`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
