Output State: **`res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer from the third split, `y` is an input integer from the fourth split, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), and (sorted(x, y)), `p1` is 0, `p2` is ((sorted(x, y))[0] - 1)² + ((sorted(x, y))[1] - 1)².**

Explanation: The code calculates the Euclidean distance squared between the last two points in the `coord` list. The last point is `(sorted(x, y))`, which means the coordinates are sorted based on the input integers `x` and `y`. The second last point is `(1, 1)`. The value of `p2` is thus calculated as the sum of the squares of the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates between these two points. All other variables remain unchanged.
