Output State: **`t` is reduced by the number of test cases processed; `s` is the sum of \((l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2\) for each test case; `n` must be non-zero; `coord` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `coord`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `s`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
