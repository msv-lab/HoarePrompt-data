Output State: **`res` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer from the first split, `y` is an input integer from the second split, `coord` is a list containing two tuples: (`x`, `y`) and (1, 1).**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Initially, `coord` contains one tuple `(1, 1)`. After appending `(x, y)`, `coord` now contains two tuples: `(1, 1)` and `(x, y)`. The values of `res` and `i` remain unchanged.
