Output State: **`x` is an integer from the second input split, `y` is an integer from the second input split, `coord` is a list containing one tuple (`x`, `y`), `i` is 4**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them by whitespace, and converts them to integers. These values are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The list `coord` already contains a tuple `(x, y)` from a previous state, so it remains unchanged except for the new values of `x` and `y`. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still 4.
