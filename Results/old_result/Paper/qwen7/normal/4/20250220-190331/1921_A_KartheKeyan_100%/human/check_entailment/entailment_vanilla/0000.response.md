### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners.
   - The square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.
   - We are given the coordinates of the corners in no particular order.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners and stores them in a list called `coord`.
   - It then sorts the coordinates. However, sorting the coordinates might not be necessary for finding the side length of the square.
   - The code calculates the distances between pairs of points to determine the side length.
     - `p1` is calculated as the squared distance between the first and second points.
     - `p2` is calculated as the squared distance between the third and fourth points.
   - It then takes the square root of these distances and multiplies them to get the area of the square.
   - The result is rounded before printing.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The approach of calculating the squared distances between pairs of points and then taking the square root to find the side length is correct.
   - Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the distances between the points should give us the side length directly.
   - The rounding of the result is unnecessary since the area will always be an integer (as the side length is an integer).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles multiple test cases correctly by decrementing `n` after processing each case.
   - The input constraints are handled appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
