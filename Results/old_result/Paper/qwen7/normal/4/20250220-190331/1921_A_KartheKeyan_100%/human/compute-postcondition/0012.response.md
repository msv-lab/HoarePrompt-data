Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an integer from the second input split, `y` is an integer from the second input split, `coord` is a list containing two tuples ((x, y), (x, y))**.

The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them, and converts them to integers, assigning them to `x` and `y`. The original values of `i` and `coord` remain unchanged.
