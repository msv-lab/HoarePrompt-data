Output State: **`x` is an integer from the fourth input split, `y` is an integer from the fourth input split, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: ((x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y)) sorted by the first element of each tuple, `i` is 4, `p1` is the squared distance between the second and the first point in `coord`, `p2` is the squared distance between the fourth and the third point in `coord`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the squared distance between the fourth and the third points in the `coord` list. Since `coord` is a list of tuples sorted by the first element of each tuple, `coord[3]` refers to the fourth point and `coord[2]` refers to the third point. The new variable `p2` is assigned the value of the squared distance between these two points, which is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
