Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the total number of iterations the loop will execute, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `a` is the first integer entered during the last iteration, and `b` is the second integer entered during the last iteration. If both `a` and `b` are odd, no changes are made. If `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the final value it iterated up to, `i` is set to `n-1` (since the loop increments `i` from 0 to `n-1`), and `a` and `b` are the values entered during the last iteration of the loop. The conditions inside the loop do not alter these variables; they only print 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values of `a` and `b`.
