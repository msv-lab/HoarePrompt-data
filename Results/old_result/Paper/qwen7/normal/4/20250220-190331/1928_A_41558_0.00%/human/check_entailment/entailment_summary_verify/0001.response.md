### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the program has issues with its conditions for determining whether a new rectangle can be formed. Specifically, the conditions `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` and `a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` do not cover all possible cases where a new rectangle can be formed. 

To properly evaluate the program, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Odd Dimensions**: If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program correctly prints 'NO' because cutting an odd-sized rectangle results in at least one dimension being even, which can be rearranged into a new rectangle.

2. **Even Dimensions**: For even dimensions, the program should check if the rectangle can be split into smaller rectangles that can be rearranged into a new rectangle. The current conditions do not cover all such cases. For example:
   - A `2x6` rectangle can be split into two `2x3` rectangles, which can be rearranged into a `4x3` rectangle.
   - A `2x4` rectangle can be split into two `2x2` rectangles, which can be rearranged into a `4x2` rectangle.

The correct approach would be to check if the dimensions allow for the formation of a new rectangle through splitting and rearrangement. Here is a revised version of the program that correctly handles these cases:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('YES')

# Test cases
func()
```

This revised program correctly identifies that if both dimensions are even, a new rectangle can always be formed by splitting and rearranging the pieces. The original program fails to handle this case correctly.

### Final Answer:
