Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `a` is the first integer from the input split.
- `b` is the second integer from the input split.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Since no values of `a` or `b` are needed to determine the output of the print statement, and the statement itself does not depend on any of the other variables, the output is straightforward.

Output: **'NO'**
