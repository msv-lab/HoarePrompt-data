### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step.

#### Problem Description:
- Bob needs to determine if he can cut a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles and then use those smaller rectangles to form another distinct rectangle.
- Two rectangles are considered the same if they can be rotated to match each other.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- It checks if both dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) are odd.
- It checks if \(a / 2\) equals \(b\) or \(b / 2\) equals \(a\).
- If either condition is met, it prints 'NO'.
- Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

#### Original Assessment:
- The assessment states that the program does not correctly handle the case where one dimension is 1 and the other is greater than 1.
- Specifically, the program incorrectly prints 'YES' for a 2x1 rectangle, which should print 'NO'.

#### Analysis:
1. **Case 1: Both Dimensions are Odd**
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the program correctly prints 'NO' because a rectangle with both odd dimensions cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles that can form another distinct rectangle.

2. **Case 2: One Dimension is Double the Other**
   - If \(a / 2 == b\) or \(b / 2 == a\), the program correctly prints 'NO' because the only way to cut the rectangle would result in two identical smaller rectangles, which cannot form a new distinct rectangle.

3. **Case 3: Neither Condition is Met**
   - If neither condition is met, the program prints 'YES', which seems to be the default case. However, this is not always correct. For example, a 2x1 rectangle should print 'NO' because it cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles that can form another distinct rectangle.

#### Correctness Check:
- **2x1 Rectangle**: The program should print 'NO' because a 2x1 rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles that can form another distinct rectangle. However, the program incorrectly prints 'YES' in this case.
- **2x6 Rectangle**: The program should print 'YES' because a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 4x3 rectangle.
- **3x2 Rectangle**: The program should print 'YES' because a 3x2 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 1x6 rectangle.

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly handle the case where one dimension is 1 and the other is greater than 1. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
