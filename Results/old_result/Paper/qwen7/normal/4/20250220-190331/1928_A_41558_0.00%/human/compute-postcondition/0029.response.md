Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer from the input split, `b` is the second integer from the input split. If `a` and `b` are both odd, no changes are made. Otherwise, if `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
