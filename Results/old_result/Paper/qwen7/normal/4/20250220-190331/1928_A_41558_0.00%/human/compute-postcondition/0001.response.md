State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Identify Variables in Loop Head**: The loop head contains three variables: `i`, `n`, and the implicit variable `range(n)`.
2. **Determine Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0).
3. **Initial Values**: Before the loop starts, `t` is given as a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\). This value does not directly affect the loop's execution but is mentioned in the initial state.
4. **Adjusting States**: To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be greater than 0. Additionally, the loop variable `i` should start from 0, which is the default starting point for the `range` function.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
