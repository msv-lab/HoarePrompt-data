Output State: **`container` is 0, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of containers, and the sum of the elements in `a` is divisible by `n`; `target` is the result of `total_water // n`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `container` to 0. The values of `total_water`, `n`, and `target` remain unchanged from their initial state because no operations are performed on them in the given code snippet.
