You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:

- Annotated Code: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
print(func_1(n, a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of containers, and a is a list of n non-negative integers representing the initial amounts of water in each container. The sum of the elements in a is divisible by n.
def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if (total_water % n != 0) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
        
    #State: Output State: The `container` variable will hold the final value after all elements in the list `a` have been processed by the loop. Specifically, for each element `water` in the list `a`, the `container` is updated by adding `water - target`. After all iterations, if the `container` is still greater than or equal to 0, the function does not return anything; otherwise, it returns 'No'.
    #
    #In natural language, the `container` will accumulate the net difference between each element in `a` and the `target` value. If at any point during these additions the `container` becomes negative, the function will terminate and return 'No'. If the loop completes without the `container` becoming negative, the final value of `container` is the output state.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes' if the container remains non-negative after processing all elements in list `a` by subtracting the `target` from each element, and returns 'No' if the container becomes negative at any point.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input and processes it correctly.
2. It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'No'.
3. It then calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`total_water // n`).
4. It iterates through the list of water amounts and checks if the cumulative difference between the current amount and the target amount remains non-negative. If it ever becomes negative, it means it's impossible to redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount, so it returns 'No'.
5. If the loop completes without finding any negative cumulative difference, it returns 'Yes'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program handles all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
