Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another.
2. The solution logic checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If it is not, it immediately returns 'No', indicating it's impossible to make the amounts equal.
3. If the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water per container is calculated as `total_water // n`.
4. The program then iterates through the list of water amounts and calculates the net difference from the target amount for each container. If at any point the cumulative difference (`container`) becomes negative, it means it's impossible to redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount, and thus it returns 'No'.
5. If the loop completes without the cumulative difference becoming negative, it returns 'Yes', indicating it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

Given the logic and the conditions provided, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
