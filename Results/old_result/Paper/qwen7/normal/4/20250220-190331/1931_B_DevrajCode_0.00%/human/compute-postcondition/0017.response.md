Output State: **`container` is the previous value of `container` plus `water - target`, `water` is the next element in the list `a`, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `a` is a list of elements whose sum is `total_water`, `target` is the result of `total_water // n`, and `container` is updated to `container + (water - target)`**.

In simpler terms: The value of `container` is updated to its previous value plus the difference between `water` and `target`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
