You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of containers, and a is a list of n non-negative integers representing the initial amounts of water in each container. The sum of the elements in a is divisible by n.
def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if (total_water % n != 0) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
        
    #State: Output State: The `container` variable will hold the final value after all elements in the list `a` have been processed by the loop. Specifically, for each element `water` in the list `a`, the `container` is updated by adding `water - target`. After all iterations, if the `container` is still greater than or equal to 0, the function does not return anything; otherwise, it returns 'No'.
    #
    #In natural language, the `container` will accumulate the net difference between each element in `a` and the `target` value. If at any point during these additions the `container` becomes negative, the function will terminate and return 'No'. If the loop completes without the `container` becoming negative, the final value of `container` is the output state.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes' if the container remains non-negative after processing all elements in list `a` by subtracting the `target` from each element, and returns 'No' if the container becomes negative at any point.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. It returns 'Yes' if subtracting the same target from each element in `a` keeps all elements non-negative; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'No'

Case_2: The program returns 'No'

Case_3: The program returns 'No'

Case_4: The program returns 'No'

Case_5: The program returns 'Yes' if the container remains non-negative after processing all elements in list `a` by subtracting the `target` from each element, and returns 'No' if the container becomes negative at any point.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
