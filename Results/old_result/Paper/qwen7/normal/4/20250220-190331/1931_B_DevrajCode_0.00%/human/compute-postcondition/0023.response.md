The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of containers, and `a`, which is a list of `n` non-negative integers representing the initial amounts of water in each container. The sum of the elements in `a` is divisible by `n`.

After processing all elements in list `a` by subtracting the same `target` (which is not specified but implied to be a constant for all elements) from each element, the function checks if the container remains non-negative throughout the process. If the container becomes negative at any point, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, if the container remains non-negative after processing all elements, the function returns 'Yes'.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. It returns 'Yes' if subtracting the same target from each element in `a` keeps all elements non-negative; otherwise, it returns 'No'.**
