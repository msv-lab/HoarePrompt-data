Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operations. Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input data at once and splits it into individual components, which is efficient for handling multiple test cases.
2. **Target Calculation**: It calculates the target amount of water per container by dividing the total amount of water by the number of containers (`total_water // n`). This ensures that if the total water is evenly divisible by the number of containers, the target is achievable.
3. **Running Total Check**: The program uses a running total (`container`) to check if it's possible to redistribute the water such that no container has less than the target amount. If at any point the running total becomes negative, it means it's impossible to achieve the target distribution because there isn't enough water to meet the target in one or more containers.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where the total water is not divisible by the number of containers, returning 'No' immediately if this condition is met.

Given the execution summary and the provided reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
