Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. It calculates a target value which is the average amount of water per container. Then, it iterates through the list `a`, adjusting a running total based on the difference between each element and the target. If at any point the running total becomes negative, the function returns 'No', indicating that it's not possible to evenly distribute the water among the containers without some container having less than the target amount. If the running total remains non-negative throughout the iteration, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that the water can be evenly distributed.**
