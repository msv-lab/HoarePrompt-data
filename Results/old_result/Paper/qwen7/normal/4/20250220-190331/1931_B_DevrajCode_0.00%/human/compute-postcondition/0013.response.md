Output State: **`container` is increased by `water - target`, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `a` is a list of elements whose sum is `total_water`, `target` is the result of `total_water // n`, `water` is the next element from the list `a`, and `container` is now `container + (water - target)`**.

In natural language, this means:
- The `container` has been updated by adding the value of `water - target`.
- `total_water` remains the sum of the elements in the list `a`.
- `a` is still a list of elements whose sum is `total_water`.
- `target` is still the result of `total_water // n`.
- `water` is still the next element from the list `a`.
- After executing the code, `container` now holds the value of its previous value plus `water - target`.
