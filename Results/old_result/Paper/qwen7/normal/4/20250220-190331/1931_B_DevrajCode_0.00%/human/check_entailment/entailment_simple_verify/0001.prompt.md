You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):

        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:

- Annotated Code: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
print(func_1(n, a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of containers, and a is a list of n non-negative integers representing the initial amounts of water in each container. The sum of the elements in a is divisible by n.
def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if (total_water % n != 0) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
        
    #State: Output State: The `container` variable will hold the final value after all elements in the list `a` have been processed by the loop. Specifically, for each element `water` in the list `a`, the `container` is updated by adding `water - target`. After all iterations, if the `container` is still greater than or equal to 0, the function does not return anything; otherwise, it returns 'No'.
    #
    #In natural language, the `container` will accumulate the net difference between each element in `a` and the `target` value. If at any point during these additions the `container` becomes negative, the function will terminate and return 'No'. If the loop completes without the `container` becoming negative, the final value of `container` is the output state.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes' if the container remains non-negative after processing all elements in list `a` by subtracting the `target` from each element, and returns 'No' if the container becomes negative at any point.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to check if we can make the amount of water in all containers equal by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container's index is always less than the destination container's index.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, then it is possible to evenly distribute the water among all containers. This is because the average amount of water per container would be an integer.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the input and splits it into `n` and the list `a`.
   - It then calls `func_1(n, a)` to determine if the distribution is possible.
   - In `func_1`, it calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'No'.
   - It then calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).
   - It iterates through the list `a` and keeps track of the difference between the current water amount and the target amount. If at any point this difference makes the cumulative difference negative, it means the distribution is not possible, and it returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'No', it means the distribution is possible, and it returns 'Yes'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the total amount of water is not divisible by `n`, returning 'No' immediately.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the distribution is possible by ensuring that the cumulative difference never goes negative.

5. **Conclusion**: The program logic is sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem. It handles all the necessary conditions and edge cases appropriately.
