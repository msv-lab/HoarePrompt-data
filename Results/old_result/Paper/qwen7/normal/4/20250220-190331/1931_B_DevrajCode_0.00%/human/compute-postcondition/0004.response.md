Output State: **`total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of containers, and the sum of the elements in `a` is divisible by `n`; `target` is the result of `total_water // n`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the `target` value by performing integer division of `total_water` by `n`. Since `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a` and is divisible by `n`, `target` will be an integer representing the average value of the elements in `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
