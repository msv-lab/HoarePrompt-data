Output State: **`total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of containers, and the sum of the elements in `a` is divisible by `n`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `total_water`. The initial state of `n` and the list `a` remains unchanged, and the new state is that `total_water` now holds the sum of the elements in `a`.
