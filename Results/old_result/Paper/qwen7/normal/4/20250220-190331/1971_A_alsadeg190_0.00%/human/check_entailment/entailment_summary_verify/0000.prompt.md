You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of pairs of integers (x, y) up to a specified number of times (t). For each pair, it ensures that the first number in the pair is greater than or equal to the second number. If the first number is less than the second, it swaps them. After processing all pairs, it outputs the final values of x and y from the last input pair provided. The function does not return any value but prints the final x and y values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. According to the problem description, the input starts with an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. However, the provided code reads only one value for `x` at the beginning and then processes each subsequent pair of integers without resetting the variables for the next test case. This means that after processing the first test case, the values of `x` and `y` from the first test case will be used for all subsequent test cases, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
1 9
8 4
1 4
```

The expected output would be:
```
1 9
4 8
1 4
```

However, the actual output from the given program would be:
```
9 1
4 8
4 1
```

This is because the program uses the values from the first test case (`x=1`, `y=9`) for all three test cases. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for handling multiple test cases, making it incorrect.
