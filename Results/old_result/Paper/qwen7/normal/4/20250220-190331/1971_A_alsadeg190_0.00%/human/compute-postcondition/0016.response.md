Output State: **`x` is an integer equal to the first input integer, `y` is an integer equal to the second input integer**.

This means that the initial value of `x` (an integer greater than 0) and the value of `y` (an integer) have been updated to the integers entered by the user as input, split by a space. The precondition that `x` was an integer greater than 0 is now replaced by the specific value obtained from the input, and `y` is now specifically the second integer from the input.
