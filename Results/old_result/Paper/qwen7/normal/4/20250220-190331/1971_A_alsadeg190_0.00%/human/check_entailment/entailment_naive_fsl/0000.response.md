Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. According to the problem description, the input starts with an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. However, the provided code reads only one value for `x` at the beginning and then processes each subsequent pair of integers without resetting the variables for the next test case. This means that after processing the first test case, the values of `x` and `y` from the first test case will be used for all subsequent test cases, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
1 9
8 4
1 4
```

The expected output would be:
```
1 9
4 8
1 4
```

However, the actual output from the given program would be:
```
9 1
4 8
4 1
```

This is because the program uses the values from the first test case (`x=1`, `y=9`) for all three test cases. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for handling multiple test cases, making it incorrect.
