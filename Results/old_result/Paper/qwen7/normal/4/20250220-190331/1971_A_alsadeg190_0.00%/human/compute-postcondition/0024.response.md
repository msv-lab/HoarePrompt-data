Functionality: **The function processes a series of pairs of integers (x, y) up to a specified number of times (t). For each pair, it ensures that the first number in the pair is greater than or equal to the second number. If the first number is less than the second, it swaps them. After processing all pairs, it outputs the final values of x and y from the last input pair provided. The function does not return any value but prints the final x and y values.**
