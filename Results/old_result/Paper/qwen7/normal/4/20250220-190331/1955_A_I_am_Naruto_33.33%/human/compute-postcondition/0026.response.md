Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the last integer entered by the user for the nth iteration where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `b` is the third integer entered by the user, and `ans1` and `ans2` are defined only if the corresponding `n > 1` during the iterations. If `n > 1`, `ans1` is the product of `a` and `n`, and `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. If `n` is not greater than 1, `ans1` and `ans2` remain undefined.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will still be within the range 1 to 10^4, `a` will be the value of `a` from the last iteration, and `b` will be the value of `b` from the first iteration. The variables `ans1` and `ans2` will only be defined if there was at least one iteration where `n > 1`, with their values calculated based on the last `n`, `a`, and `b` values from that iteration. If no such iteration exists, they will remain undefined.
