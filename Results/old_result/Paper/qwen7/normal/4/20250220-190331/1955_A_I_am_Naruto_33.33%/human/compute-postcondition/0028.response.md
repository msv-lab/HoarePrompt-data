Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates either \( a \times n \) or \( b \times n / 2 + a \times n \% 2 \) (whichever is smaller), and prints the result. If \( n \) is 1, it simply prints \( a \). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the calculated results for each test case.**
