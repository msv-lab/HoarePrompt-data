Reasoning:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for Maxim to buy \( n \) yogurts under the given conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases, \( t \).
2. For each test case, it reads three integers: \( n \) (the number of yogurts), \( a \) (the price of one yogurt), and \( b \) (the price of two yogurts).
3. It then calculates two possible costs:
   - \( ans1 = a \times n \): This is the cost if Maxim buys all yogurts at the regular price.
   - \( ans2 = b \times \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor + a \times (n \mod 2) \): This is the cost if Maxim takes advantage of the promotion as much as possible and buys some yogurts at the promotional price and the rest at the regular price.
4. It prints the minimum of these two values, which ensures the minimum cost for buying \( n \) yogurts.
5. If \( n = 1 \), it directly prints \( a \), which is correct because there's no promotion available for a single yogurt.

Given the logic and the provided example, the program correctly computes the minimum cost for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
