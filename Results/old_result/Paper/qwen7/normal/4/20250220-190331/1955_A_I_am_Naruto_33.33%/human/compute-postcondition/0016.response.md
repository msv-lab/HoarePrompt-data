Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the second integer entered by the user, `b` is the third integer entered by the user, `n` is the new integer input from the user, `ans1` is defined and equals `a * n` if `n > 1`, otherwise it is undefined, `ans2` is defined and equals `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` if `n > 1`, otherwise it is undefined.
