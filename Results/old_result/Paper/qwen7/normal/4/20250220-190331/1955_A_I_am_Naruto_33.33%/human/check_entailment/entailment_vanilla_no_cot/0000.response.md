Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts given the prices `a` and `b`. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. If `n` is greater than 1, it calculates two possible costs:
   - `ans1`: The cost if each yogurt is bought individually at price `a`.
   - `ans2`: The cost if the maximum number of pairs of yogurts are bought at the promotional price `b`, and any remaining yogurt is bought at the regular price `a`.
4. It then prints the minimum of these two costs.
5. If `n` is 1, it simply prints the price `a` since no promotion applies to buying just one yogurt.

This logic ensures that the program correctly handles all scenarios as per the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.
