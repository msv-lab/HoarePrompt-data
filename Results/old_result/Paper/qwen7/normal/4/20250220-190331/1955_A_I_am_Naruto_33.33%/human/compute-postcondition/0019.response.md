Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `n > 1`, `a` is the second integer entered by the user, `b` is the third integer entered by the user, `ans1` is undefined, `ans2` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. It does not affect the values of `t`, `ans1`, or `ans2`. Since `ans1` and `ans2` are only defined if `n > 1`, and now `n` is an integer greater than 1, their definitions remain unchanged (i.e., they are still undefined). The value of `n` is now known and greater than 1, which affects the conditions under which `ans1` and `ans2` could be defined in the future.
