Output State: **The program returns `res`, which is the total number of unique elements in the list `a` after transforming each element using `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, still holding the original positive integer. The list `a` stays the same, containing the original `n` non-negative integers. The dictionary `count` maps each transformed number to its frequency in the list `a`.**

This means that after the loop processes all elements in the list `a`, `res` will hold the count of distinct transformed elements, while `n` and `a` retain their initial values, and `count` keeps track of how often each transformed number appears in the original list `a`.
