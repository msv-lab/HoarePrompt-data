Output State: **`res` is either 1 or 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers with at least one element, `count` is a dictionary where the first element of the list `a` is a key, `count[num]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `count[num] -= 1` decrements the value of `count[num]` by 1. The value of `num` is the next element in the list `a` following the first element which is the key in the dictionary `count`. The values of `res`, `n`, `a`, and the dictionary `count` with other keys remain unchanged.
