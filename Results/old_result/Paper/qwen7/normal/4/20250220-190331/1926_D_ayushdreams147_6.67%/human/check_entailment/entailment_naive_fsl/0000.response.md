Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to use bitwise operations to group numbers based on their 31 least significant bits. However, the approach used in `func_1` is flawed.

The program uses the expression `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to transform each number. This expression flips all the bits of the number, which is not the correct way to ensure that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit value from the 1st to the 31st bit.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the 31 least significant bits of each number. The correct approach would be to treat these 31 bits as a 31-bit integer and use this integer to determine the group. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        key = num & ((1 << 31) - 1)  # Extract the 31 least significant bits
        if key not in count:
            count[key] = 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[key] += 1
    return res

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))
```

This corrected function correctly groups numbers based on their 31 least significant bits, ensuring that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit value from the 1st to the 31st bit. The original program fails to do this, hence the correctness is **False**.
