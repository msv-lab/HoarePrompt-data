Postcondition: `res` is either 2, 1, or 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers with at least one element, `count` is a dictionary where the first element of the list `a` is a key. If the next element `num` of the list `a` is not in the dictionary `count`, then `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is incremented by 1. If `num` is already in `count`, then the value of each key in `count` is decreased by 1.
