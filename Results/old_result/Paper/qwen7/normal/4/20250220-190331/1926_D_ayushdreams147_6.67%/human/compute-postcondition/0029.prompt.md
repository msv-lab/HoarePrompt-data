You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that each integer in the list is less than \(2^{31}\).
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `res` will be equal to the total number of unique elements in the list `a` (considering the transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`), `n` will still be the original positive integer, `a` will remain as the list of `n` non-negative integers, and `count` will be a dictionary where each key is transformed using `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`. The value associated with each key in `count` will reflect how many times the original number (before transformation) appeared in the list `a`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `res` will count the number of distinct elements in the list `a` when considering each element's transformed version, `n` and `a` will stay the same as they were initially, and `count` will map each transformed number to its frequency in the list `a`.
    return res
    #The program returns `res`, which is the total number of unique elements in the list `a` after transforming each element using `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, still holding the original positive integer. The list `a` stays the same, containing the original `n` non-negative integers. The dictionary `count` maps each transformed number to its frequency in the list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\). The function returns `res`, the total number of unique elements in the list `a` after transforming each element using `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`. The variable `n` and the list `a` remain unchanged. Additionally, the function creates a dictionary `count` that maps each transformed number to its frequency in the list `a`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `res`, which is the total number of unique elements in the list `a` after transforming each element using `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, still holding the original positive integer. The list `a` stays the same, containing the original `n` non-negative integers. The dictionary `count` maps each transformed number to its frequency in the list `a`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
