The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\). It returns the total number of unique elements in the list `a` after transforming each element using the bitwise operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`. The variable `n` and the list `a` remain unchanged after the function execution. Additionally, it creates a dictionary `count` that maps each transformed number to its frequency in the list `a`.
