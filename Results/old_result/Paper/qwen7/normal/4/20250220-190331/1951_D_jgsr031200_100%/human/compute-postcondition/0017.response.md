Output State: **`h` is `n // i`, `n` is `n - i * curr`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `n - k + 1` and the second element is `1`, `i` is `1`, `curr` is `n // 1`**

Explanation: The code sets `curr` to `n // i`. Given that `i` is `1`, `curr` becomes `n // 1`, which is simply `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
