Output: **YES**

Explanation: The initial state provides the values for the variables `h` and `n`, but these are not relevant to the print statement. The print statement simply outputs the string 'YES', regardless of the values of other variables like `k` and `costs`. Since no conditions or formulas need to be evaluated for this specific print statement, it directly prints the string 'YES'.
