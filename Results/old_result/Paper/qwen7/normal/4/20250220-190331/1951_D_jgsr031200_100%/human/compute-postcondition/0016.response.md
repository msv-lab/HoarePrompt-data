Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `costs`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the `costs` list.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `h` is `n // i`
   - `n` is `n - i * curr`
   - `k` is a positive integer
   - `costs` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `n - k + 1` and the second element is `1`

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `costs`, the value of `i` will be the next element in the `costs` list.
   - The list `costs` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `h` remains unchanged because it is not used in the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not used in the loop.
   - `k` remains unchanged because it is not used in the loop.
   - `costs` remains the same list, but now `i` will be the next element in the list.

Given that `costs` is a list with two elements `[n - k + 1, 1]`, the next value of `i` will be `1` (the second element in the list).

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`h` is `n // i`, `n` is `n - i * curr`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `n - k + 1` and the second element is `1`, `i` is `1`**.
