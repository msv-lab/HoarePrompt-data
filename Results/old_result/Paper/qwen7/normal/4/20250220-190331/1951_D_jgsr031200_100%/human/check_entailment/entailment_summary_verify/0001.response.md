### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires determining if Bob can set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily from the lowest priced stall to the highest.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of coins Alice has) and `k` (the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).
   - It then calls the function `func_1(n, k)`.

3. **Function `func_1(n, k)` Analysis**:
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES", `1`, and `1`. This means Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels if she has exactly `k` coins.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO". This is because Alice cannot buy even one jewel if she has fewer coins than the desired number of jewels.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]`. This is a heuristic approach to distribute the cost across two stalls.
   - It calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and checks if the total number of jewels bought is at least `k`.
   - If the total number of stalls needed is less than `k`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES", `2`, and the two prices.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for handling `n == k` and `n < k` is correct.
   - The heuristic approach used in `func_1` might not always find a solution, but it is a reasonable attempt to solve the problem within the constraints.
   - However, the heuristic approach may fail in some edge cases, particularly when the exact distribution of prices is required.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle all edge cases, particularly when the exact distribution of prices is necessary to achieve exactly `k` jewels.
   - The heuristic approach might not always find a valid solution, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Case 1: \( n = k \)**:
  - The code correctly handles this case by printing "YES", `1`, and `1`.

- **Case 2: \( n < k \)**:
  - The code correctly handles this case by printing "NO".

- **Case 3: \( n \geq k \)**:
  - The heuristic approach used in `func_1` initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]`. This ensures that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by buying from the first stall until she runs out of coins, and then from the second stall.
  - However, this heuristic does not guarantee that the solution is optimal or that it will work for all possible values of `n` and `k`.

### Example Analysis:

- **Example 1: \( n = 7 \), \( k = 3 \)**:
  - The code correctly prints "YES", `1`, and `1` because Alice can buy 3 jewels with 7 coins.

- **Example 2: \( n = 6 \), \( k = 4 \)**:
  - The code correctly prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy 4 jewels with only 6 coins.

- **Example 3: \( n = 255 \), \( k = 8 \)**:
  - The code correctly prints "YES", `8`, and the sequence `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]` because Alice can buy exactly 8 jewels by buying from each stall in sequence.

### Conclusion:

While the code provides a reasonable heuristic approach and handles some edge cases correctly, it does not guarantee a correct solution for all possible values of `n` and `k`. The heuristic approach might fail in certain scenarios, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given code is not fully correct and may produce incorrect results in some edge cases.
