### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to determine if Bob can set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily from the lowest priced stall to the highest.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of coins Alice has) and `k` (the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).
   - It then calls the function `func_1(n, k)`.

3. **Function `func_1(n, k)` Analysis**:
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES", `1`, and `1`. This means Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels if she has exactly `k` coins.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO". This is because Alice cannot buy even one jewel if she has fewer coins than the desired number of jewels.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]`. This is a heuristic approach to distribute the cost across two stalls.
   - It calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and checks if the total number of jewels bought is at least `k`.
   - If the total number of stalls needed is less than `k`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES", `2`, and the two prices.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for handling `n == k` and `n < k` is correct.
   - The heuristic approach used in `func_1` might not always find a solution, but it is a reasonable attempt to solve the problem within the constraints.
   - However, the heuristic approach may fail in some edge cases, especially when the exact distribution of prices is required.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle all edge cases, particularly when the exact distribution of prices is necessary to achieve exactly `k` jewels.
   - The heuristic approach might not always find a valid solution, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Conclusion:
The given code attempts to solve the problem but does not guarantee correctness in all scenarios. Therefore, the code is not fully correct.

### Correctness:
**False**
