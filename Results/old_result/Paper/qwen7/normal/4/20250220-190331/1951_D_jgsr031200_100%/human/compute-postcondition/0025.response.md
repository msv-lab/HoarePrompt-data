Output State: `h` is 2, `n` is -1, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is [1 - k, 1].

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `h` remains 2 because each iteration adds `n // i` to `h` and decreases `n` by `i * curr`. The loop terminates when `n` becomes less than the smallest element in `costs`, which is 1. Since `n` is reduced to -1, it means that the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop. The `costs` list also remains unchanged as it was not modified during the loop's execution.
