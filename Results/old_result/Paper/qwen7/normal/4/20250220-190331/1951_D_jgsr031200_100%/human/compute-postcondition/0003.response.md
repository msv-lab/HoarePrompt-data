Output: **1**

Explanation: According to the initial state, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\), and it is explicitly stated that `n` is equal to `k`. The print statement simply outputs the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `n` and `k`. Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not needed to determine the output of the print statement, the output is simply `1`.
