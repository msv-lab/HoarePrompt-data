Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of stalls needed exceeds 60. According to the problem description, Bob can set up at most 60 stalls. However, the current implementation only considers up to 2 stalls, which is insufficient for many cases.

For example, consider the following input:

```
255 8
```

The program will output:
```
YES
2
255 1
```

This is incorrect because it only considers setting up 2 stalls, but the solution requires more than 2 stalls. A valid solution would be to set up 8 stalls with prices `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128]`, allowing Alice to buy exactly 8 jewels. However, the program does not generate this or any other valid configuration that uses up to 60 stalls.

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to ensure that it can handle up to 60 stalls and find a valid configuration that allows Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.
