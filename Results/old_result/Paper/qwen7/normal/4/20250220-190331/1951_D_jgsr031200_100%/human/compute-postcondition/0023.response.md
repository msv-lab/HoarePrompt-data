Output State: **`h` is 2, `n` is -1, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is [1 - k, 1], `i` is 1, `curr` is 0**

Explanation: The code `n -= i * curr` subtracts `i * curr` from `n`. Given the initial values, `i` is 1 and `curr` is 0, so `i * curr` equals 0. Therefore, `n` remains unchanged by this operation. However, since `n` is initially 0, subtracting 0 from it results in `n` becoming -1. The values of `h`, `k`, `costs`, and `i` remain unchanged, and `curr` is also unchanged.
