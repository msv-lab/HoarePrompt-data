Output State: **`h` is `n // 1 + n // 1`, `n` is `n - 1 * (n // 1)`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `n - k + 1` and the second element is `1`, `i` is `1`, `curr` is `n // 1`**

Explanation: The code `n -= i * curr` subtracts `i * curr` from `n`. Given that `i` is `1` and `curr` is `n // 1` (which is `n` since `n // 1` equals `n`), the value of `n` is reduced by `n`. Therefore, `n` is now `n - n`, which simplifies to `0`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
