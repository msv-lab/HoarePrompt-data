Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in costs:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `costs`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `h` is `n // 1 + n // 1`
   - `n` is `n - 1 * (n // 1)`
   - `k` is a positive integer
   - `costs` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `n - k + 1` and the second element is `1`
   - `i` is `1`
   - `curr` is `n // 1`

3. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be one of the elements in the `costs` list.

4. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` is currently `1`, and `costs` is a list with two elements `[n - k + 1, 1]`, the next value of `i` could be either `n - k + 1` or `1`.
   - Given that `i` is `1` now, the next value of `i` will be the second element of the `costs` list, which is `1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to `1` (it remains the same as it is already `1`).
   - `costs` will be the same list since it is not modified within the loop.

6. **Final state**: The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated values of `i` and `costs`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`h` is `n // 1 + n // 1`, `n` is `n - 1 * (n // 1)`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `n - k + 1` and the second element is `1`, `i` is `1`**
