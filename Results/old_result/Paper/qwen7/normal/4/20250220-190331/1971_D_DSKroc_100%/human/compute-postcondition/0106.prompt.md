Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, and it is assigned the value of `int(input())`.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 0
    flag = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
        if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
            count += 1
        if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
            flag = 1
    if flag == 0:
        print(count + 1)
    else:
        print(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(s) - 2`, `s` is a string with a length greater than 1, `count` will be incremented for each pair of consecutive characters where the first character is less than the second character, and `flag` will be 1 if any pair of consecutive characters satisfies the condition `int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1])` during the loop's execution; otherwise, `flag` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: i is `len(s) - 1`, count is incremented by 1 for each pair of elements where they are not equal, and flag remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `-1`, `count` is a value between 0 and `len(s)-1`, `flag` is either `0` or `1`, `q` is `previous_q + len(s) - 1`, `t` is greater than `previous_q + len(s) - 1`, and `len(s)` is greater than `1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
