Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a test case where `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, and `s` is a binary string with a length between 1 and 500. The function returns a result based on these inputs.**

This means the function is designed to process a test case containing two elements: an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. However, since the function definition does not explicitly include these parameters, the description focuses on the implied inputs and the expected return value based on those inputs.
