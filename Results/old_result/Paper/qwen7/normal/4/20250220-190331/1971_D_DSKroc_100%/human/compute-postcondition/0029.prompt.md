Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 500, `q` is 0, `s` is an input string, `count` is 0, `flag` is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(s) - 1):
    if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
        count += 1
    if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
        flag = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `s` is a string with length greater than 1, `count` is 1 if the first character of `s` (converted to integer) is less than the second character of `s` (converted to integer), otherwise `count` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `s` is a string with length greater than 1. If the first character of `s` (converted to integer) is less than the second character of `s` (converted to integer), then `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `s` is a string with length greater than 1, `count` remains unchanged, and if the character at index `i` (which is `s[2]`) is less than the character at index `i + 1` (which is `s[3]`), then `flag` is 1; otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
