Output State: **`i` is incremented by 2, `same` is an integer incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]`, and `i + 1 < len(ar)`**.

Explanation: The code `same += 1` increments the value of `same` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is incremented by 1 (from its initial state of being incremented by 1) to become incremented by 2, and `same` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, and the condition `i + 1 < len(ar)`) remain as they were initially.
