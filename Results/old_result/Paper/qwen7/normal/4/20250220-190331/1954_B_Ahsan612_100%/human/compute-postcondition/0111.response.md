Postcondition: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is now equal to `ar[0]`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 2, and `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` becomes 2, `i` becomes 2, and `num` remains the same. Otherwise, `same` remains 1, `minn` is set to 1, `i` becomes 3, and `num` is updated to `ar[3]`.**
