Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `same` is an integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is now the value of `ar[i]`, `minn` is the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]`, and `i + 1 < len(ar)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `num` to be the value of `ar[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `i` was already incremented by 1 before this line, it is incremented by 1 again here, making `i` one more than its previous value. The other variables (`same`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `minn`, and the condition involving `i`) remain in their original states.
