The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is set to 3. After incrementing, `i` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is now `ar[0]`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 4.**
