Let's analyze the given state and the `while` loop condition step by step.

### Given State:
- `same` is 1
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers
- `num` is now `ar[0]`
- `minn` is infinity
- `i` is 2

### While Loop Condition:
```
while i < len(ar):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(ar)`.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: The current value of `i` is 2.
3. **Condition Check**: For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

Given that `i` is currently 2, the loop will execute the first time if `len(ar)` is greater than 2.

### Conclusion:
The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`. Since `i` is 2, `len(ar)` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute the first time.

### Final Answer:
State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is now `ar[0]`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 2, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 2**
