Output State: **`same` is either 4 or 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is now `ar[0]` if `ar[i]` equals `num`, otherwise `num` is `ar[i]`, `minn` is the minimum of 2 and `same`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was previously less than `len(ar)`, after incrementing, `i` is now one more than its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
