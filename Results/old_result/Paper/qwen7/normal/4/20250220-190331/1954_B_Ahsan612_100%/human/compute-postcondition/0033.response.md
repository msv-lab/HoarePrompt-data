Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `same` is an integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is now the value of `ar[i]`, `minn` is the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]` after updating with `same`, and `i + 1 < len(ar)`**.

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value (`minn`) and the value of `same`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
