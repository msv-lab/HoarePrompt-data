Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. Specifically, the program does not handle cases where the array has multiple segments of consecutive identical elements properly.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The program will output `1`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `1` because removing the element at index 2 (value 1) will result in the array `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful anymore. However, the program incorrectly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove as `1`.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly identify and count the minimum number of elements to remove for each segment of consecutive identical elements. The current implementation only considers the first segment and does not account for other segments properly.
