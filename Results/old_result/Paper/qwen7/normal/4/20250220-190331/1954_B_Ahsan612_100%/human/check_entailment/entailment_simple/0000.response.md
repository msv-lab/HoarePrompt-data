Reasoning:
1. The provided function attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any number in the array `ar`. This is done by iterating through the array and tracking the count of consecutive occurrences of the current number (`num`). When a different number is encountered, the count is reset, and the minimum count (`same`) is updated.
2. After the loop, the function checks if the minimum count (`minn`) is infinite or equal to the length of the array. If so, it prints `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements. Otherwise, it prints `minn`, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed.
3. However, there are a few issues with the logic:
   - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array is already non-beautiful. It only checks if the minimum count is infinite or equal to the length of the array, but it should also consider other scenarios where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing fewer elements.
   - The function does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only considers the minimum count of consecutive occurrences, but it should also consider the structure of the array and the positions of the elements.
4. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the function needs to be more sophisticated to correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove.

Correctness: **False**

The provided function does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It fails to account for all possible scenarios where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing fewer elements.
