Output State: **`same` is either 3 or 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is now `ar[i]`, `minn` is the minimum of 2 and `same`, `i` is `i + 1` and is less than `len(ar)`**.

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum of its current value (which is 2) and `same`. Since `same` is either 3 or 1, the new value of `minn` will be 1 because 1 is less than 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
