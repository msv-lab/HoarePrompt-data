Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is now `ar[0]`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is equal to the length of the list `ar`**.

Explanation: The line `minn = inf` assigns the value `inf` (infinity) to the variable `minn`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
