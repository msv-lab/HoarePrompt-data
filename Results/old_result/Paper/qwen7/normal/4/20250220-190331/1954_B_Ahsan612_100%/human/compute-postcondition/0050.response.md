Output State: **`same` is an integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]` after updating with `same`, `i` is equal to the length of the list `ar`, `ar` is updated with new integer values from input.**

Explanation: The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `ar`. The other variables (`same`, `t`, `n`, `num`, `minn`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
