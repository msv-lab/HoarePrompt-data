Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is now `ar[4]`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 4, and `ar[4]` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `num` to be the value of `ar[4]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
