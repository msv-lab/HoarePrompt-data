Based on the initial state provided:

- `same` is between 1 and `len(ar)-1`.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
- `num` is the last element in `ar` that was different from the previous `num` or `ar[0]` if no such element exists.
- `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop.
- `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.
- `minn` is not equal to infinity and `minn` is not equal to `len(ar)`.

The `print(minn)` statement will print the value of `minn`.

Given the conditions, `minn` is explicitly stated to be the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop and it is neither infinity nor equal to `len(ar)`. Therefore, `minn` must be a valid integer within the range specified for `same`.

Output: **minn (the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop)**
