Output State: **`same` is 2, `minn` is 2, `i` is 6**

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum of its current value (`same`, which is 2) and the previous value of `minn`. Since `same` is 2 and `minn` is initially infinity (or a very large number), `minn` is updated to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
