Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is infinity.**

Explanation: The code initializes `minn` to `inf` (which represents infinity). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
