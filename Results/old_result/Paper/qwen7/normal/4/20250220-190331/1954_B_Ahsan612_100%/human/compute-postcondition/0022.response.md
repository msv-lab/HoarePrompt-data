Output State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `i`, it is only stated that `i` is less than `len(ar)`. After the increment, `i` is now `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
