Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `same` is an integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]`, `i` is less than `len(ar)`**.

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
