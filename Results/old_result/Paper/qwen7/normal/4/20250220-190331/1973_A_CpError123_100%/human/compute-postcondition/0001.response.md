State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t` which is used as the range parameter.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a valid integer within the specified range (1 to 500 inclusive).
3. The other variables (`_`) are just placeholders and do not affect the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring it is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
