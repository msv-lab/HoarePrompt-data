The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is just a placeholder and does not hold any state) and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` was between 1 and 500 inclusive at the end of the previous iteration, it means `t` was at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `x` is the integer division of `(a + b + c)` by 2, `y` is `a + b`**
