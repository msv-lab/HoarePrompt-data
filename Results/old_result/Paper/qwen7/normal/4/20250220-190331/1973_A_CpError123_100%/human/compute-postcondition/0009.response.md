Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `x` is the integer division of `(a + b + c)` by 2.**

Explanation: The code calculates `x` as the integer division of the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` by 2. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial state.
