Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `x` is the integer division of `(a + b + c)` by 2, `y` is `a + b`, and we continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states. The `continue` statement only affects the flow of the loop, causing the loop to proceed to the next iteration without executing the remaining statements in the current iteration.
