Output State: The value of `t` will be 0, as the loop runs from `range(t)`, and after all iterations, `t` will reach 0 since each iteration decreases `t` by 1. For each remaining value of `t`, the same process of taking three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, checking if their sum is even, and then calculating `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2` and `y` as `a + b` will occur. If the sum is odd, `-1` will be printed and the loop will continue with the next value of `t`. After all iterations, if there are no more values of `t`, the loop ends, and `t` is set to 0. Variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, and `y` will retain their last computed values based on the last set of inputs provided before `t` became 0.

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `t` will be 0, and the final values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, and `y` will be those from the last set of inputs processed before `t` reached 0.
