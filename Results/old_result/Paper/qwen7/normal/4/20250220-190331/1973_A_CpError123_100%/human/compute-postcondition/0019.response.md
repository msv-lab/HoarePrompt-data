Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `x` is the integer division of `(a + b + c)` by 2, `y` is `a + b`.**

The code `y = a + b` does not change the values of any variables except for `y`. It simply reassigns the value of `y` to be the sum of `a` and `b`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`) remain unchanged.
