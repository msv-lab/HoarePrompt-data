Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `x` is the integer division of `(a + b + c)` by 2, `y` is `a + b`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the values entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
