Output State: **`j` is `j + 2`, `m` must be greater than `j + 1`, and `b[j + 1]` must not equal `a[i]`**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Since `j` was initially `j + 1`, after the increment, `j` becomes `j + 2`. The conditions for `m` and `b[j + 1]` remain unchanged as no operations affect them.
