Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is equal to `m`.
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `b[j-1]` (which is `b[m-1]`) does not equal `a[i]`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `a` is a string obtained from the input.
   - `b` is a user input string.
   - `k` remains 0.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop depends on `i` and `n`, we need to update these variables.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value less than `n`, and `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`.

Given that `n` is greater than 0 and there are no conditions that would change `n` within the loop, `n` remains the same.

So, the updated state for the next iteration is:
- `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.

Since `n` is greater than 0, the loop will continue if `i + 1 < n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `b[j-1]` (which is `b[m-1]`) does not equal `a[i]`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string obtained from the input, `b` is a user input string, and `i` is `i + 1`**.
