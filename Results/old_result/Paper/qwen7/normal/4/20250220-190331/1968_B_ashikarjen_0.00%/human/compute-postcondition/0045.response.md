Output State: `j` is equal to `m`, `b[j-1]` (which is `b[m-1]`) does not equal `a[i]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `b[j-1]` (which is `b[m-1]`) does not equal `a[i]`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string obtained from the input, `b` is a user input string, and `i` is `i + 1`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `j` as long as `j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`. Since the loop condition is `j < m` and it increments `j` by 1 each iteration, eventually `j` will reach the value of `m`. At this point, the condition `j < m` will no longer be true, and the loop will terminate. Therefore, after all iterations, `j` will be equal to `m`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
