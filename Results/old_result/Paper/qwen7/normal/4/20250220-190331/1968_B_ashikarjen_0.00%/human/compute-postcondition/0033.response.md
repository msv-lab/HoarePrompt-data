Output State: **`j` is equal to `m` + 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `b[j-1]` (which is `b[m]`) does not equal `a[i]`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string obtained from the input, `b` is a string input by the user, `k` is equal to 1, and the condition `j < m` is false.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, making it equal to `m` + 1. Since `j` was initially less than `m`, after incrementing `j` by 1, the condition `j < m` becomes false. All other variables remain unchanged.
