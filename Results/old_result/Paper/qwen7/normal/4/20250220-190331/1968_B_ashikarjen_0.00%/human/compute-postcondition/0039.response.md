Output State: **`j` is less than `m` and `j` is increased by 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `b[j-1]` (which is `b[m-1]`) does not equal `a[i]`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string obtained from the input, `b` is a user input string, and `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `j` is incremented by 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `j` is now less than `m` and has been increased by 1, while all other variables and their conditions are the same as before.
