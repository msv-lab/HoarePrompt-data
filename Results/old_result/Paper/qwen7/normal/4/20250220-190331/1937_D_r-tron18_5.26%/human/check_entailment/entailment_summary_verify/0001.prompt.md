You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and computes a list `ans` where each element represents the balance of '<' and '>' characters up to that position in the string. Specifically, for each character in `s1`, it calculates the difference between the count of '>' characters seen so far and the count of '<' characters seen so far, adjusted by the remaining indices. The function then prints the list `ans`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a 1D grid of length `n`.
   - Each cell contains a character `<` or `>`.
   - A pinball starts at a specific cell and moves left or right based on the character in the current cell.
   - The character in the current cell is inverted after each move.
   - The pinball stops when it goes out of bounds (left or right).

2. **Given Code:**
   - The code defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is not directly used in the main logic but seems to be related to accumulation or difference calculations.
   - `func_2` is the main function that processes the input and calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` takes a string `s1` and an integer `n`.
   - It initializes some lists and accumulates values.
   - It iterates backward through the string `s1` and calculates the time for each cell using complex logic involving `pre`, `preOne`, and `suffZero`.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_2`

- **Initialization:**
  ```python
  pre = [i + 1 for (i, el) in enumerate(s1) if el == '>']
  totalOne = len(pre)
  preOne = list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))
  suffZero = [0]
  ans = [0] * n
  ```
  - `pre` stores positions where the character is `>` and their indices.
  - `totalOne` counts the number of `>` characters.
  - `preOne` is the cumulative sum of `pre` with an initial value of 0.
  - `suffZero` is initialized with 0.
  - `ans` is initialized to store results for each cell.

- **Main Loop:**
  ```python
  for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
      el = s1[i]
      if el == '>':
          # Logic for '>' character
      else:
          # Logic for '<' character
  ```
  - The loop iterates backward through the string.
  - For each cell, it checks if the character is `>` or `<` and updates the result accordingly.

- **Logic for `>` Character:**
  ```python
  (ol, zr) = (totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1)
  if ol <= zr:
      zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
      oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
      ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
  else:
      zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
      oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
      oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
      fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
      ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
  preOne.pop()
  totalOne -= 1
  ```
  - This part handles the case when the character is `>`.
  - It uses `func_1` to compute differences and updates the result.

- **Logic for `<` Character:**
  ```python
  suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
  (ol, zr) = (totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1)
  if zr <= ol:
      zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
      oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
      ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
  else:
      zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
      oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
      ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
  ```
  - This part handles the case when the character is `<`.
  - It updates `suffZero` and computes the result similarly.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, it appears that the logic for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid is complex and involves detailed state management and accumulation. However, the overall approach seems to correctly handle the problem constraints and requirements.

Given the complexity and the detailed logic, the code should work correctly for the given problem.
