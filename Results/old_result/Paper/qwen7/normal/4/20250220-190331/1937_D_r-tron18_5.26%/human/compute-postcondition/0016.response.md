Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` including itself, `suffZero` is a list containing only the value 0, `ans` is a list of n zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is the sum of `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` - `func_1(preOne, 1)`**.

Explanation: The line `oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)` subtracts the value of `func_1(preOne, 1)` from `oneInd`. The value of `oneInd` is initially the sum of `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`. After executing the line, `oneInd` becomes the sum of `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` minus `func_1(preOne, 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
