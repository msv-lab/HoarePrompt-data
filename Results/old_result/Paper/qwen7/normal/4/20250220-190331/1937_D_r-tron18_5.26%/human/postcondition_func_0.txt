Functionality: The function accepts an array `arr` and an integer `times`. It calculates and returns the difference between the last element of the array and the element at an index derived from the length of the array and the value of `times`. Specifically, it subtracts the element at the index which is the maximum of -n (where n is the length of the array) and -1 minus `times` from the last element of the array.
