Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` including itself, `suffZero` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `suffZero` including the current index (i+1), `ans` is a list of n zeros with the i-th element updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, `el` is the character at index `i` in `s1` which is not equal to '>', `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is calculated as 2 times the result of `func_1(preOne, zr)`**

Explanation: The code updates the `ans` list by setting the i-th element to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `oneInd` is not explicitly used in the final calculation, but it is defined as 2 times the result of `func_1(preOne, zr)`, which remains unchanged unless `func_1` is called and its result changes.
