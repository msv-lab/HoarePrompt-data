Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` including itself, `suffZero` is a list containing only the value 0, `ans` is a list of n zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is 2 times the value returned by `func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is 2 times the last element of `preOne` minus the value returned by `func_1(preOne, 1)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `oneInd` to be twice the last element of `preOne` minus the value returned by `func_1(preOne, 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
