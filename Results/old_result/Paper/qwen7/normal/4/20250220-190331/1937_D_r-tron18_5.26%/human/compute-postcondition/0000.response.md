Output State: **`s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list comprehension that iterates over the enumerated elements of `s1`. For each element where the character is '>', it calculates the index (i) plus one and adds it to the list `pre`. The length of `s1` remains n, and its content remains unchanged. The new variable `pre` contains the calculated indices.
