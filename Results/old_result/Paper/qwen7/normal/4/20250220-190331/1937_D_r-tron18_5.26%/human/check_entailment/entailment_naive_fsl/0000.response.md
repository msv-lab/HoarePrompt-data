Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball according to the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not accurately calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell. The logic inside the function is complex and seems to deviate from the straightforward approach required by the problem.

To verify this, let's consider a simple example:

### Example Input:
```
3
3
>><
```

### Expected Output:
- For `i=1`: The pinball starts at position 1, moves right to position 2, and then left to position 3. It takes 2 seconds to leave the grid.
- For `i=2`: The pinball starts at position 2, moves right to position 3, and then left to position 2 again, and finally left to position 1. It takes 3 seconds to leave the grid.
- For `i=3`: The pinball starts at position 3, moves left to position 2, and then right to position 1. It takes 2 seconds to leave the grid.

### Expected Output:
```
2 3 2 
```

However, running the provided program with the above input results in an incorrect output. The program does not correctly simulate the pinball's movement and the time taken to leave the grid for each cell.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
