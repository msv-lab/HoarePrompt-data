Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` including itself, `suffZero` is a list containing only the value 0, `ans` is a list of n zeros, `el` is the character at index `i` in `s1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code `el = s1[i]` assigns the character at index `i` in the string `s1` to the variable `el`. Since `i` is an index within the string `s1`, `el` now holds the character at that specific position. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
