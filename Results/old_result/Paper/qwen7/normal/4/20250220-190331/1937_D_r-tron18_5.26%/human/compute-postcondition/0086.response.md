Postcondition: **`totalOne` is adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not. If `el` is '>', `totalOne` is the length of `pre` minus 2, otherwise it is the length of `pre` minus 1. `s1` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` and `preOne` lists are updated according to the value of `el`. `suffZero` is updated by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`. `ans` remains a list of `n` zeros. `i` remains unchanged. `el` remains the same as `s1[i]`. `suffZero` now has one more element. `ol` and `zr` are updated based on the length of `suffZero`. `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are updated according to the conditions specified in the if and else parts.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after executing the if-else block, considering both possible outcomes of the if condition.
