Output State: **`ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `zeroInd - oneInd` to `ans[i]`. Since the values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are defined in terms of other variables, they remain unchanged. The other variables (`ol`, `zr`) also remain unchanged. Therefore, the only new information is the value of `ans[i]`, which is the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd`.
