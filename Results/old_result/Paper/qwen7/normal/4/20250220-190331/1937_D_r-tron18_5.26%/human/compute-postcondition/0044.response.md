Output State: **`ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `2 * suffZero[-1]` to the variable `zeroInd`. The values of `ol` (which is `totalOne`) and `zr` (which is `len(suffZero) - 1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
