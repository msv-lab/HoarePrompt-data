### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves simulating the movement of a pinball on a one-dimensional grid where each cell contains either '<' or '>'. The pinball moves according to the direction indicated by the cell and changes the direction of the cell after each move until it leaves the grid.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function is supposed to calculate a specific difference based on an array and an integer. However, the implementation seems to have issues because it uses `n` which is not defined within the scope of this function. Also, the logic inside the function does not seem to directly relate to the problem's requirements.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function correctly simulates the pinball movement and calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. It uses prefix sums and suffix sums to efficiently compute the required values.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Function 2 Logic**: The function correctly identifies the positions of '>' and '<' using prefix sums. It then iterates backward through the string, calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. The logic for updating the answers and handling the changes in the grid state is sound.
   - **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as when the pinball starts at the boundary of the grid, ensuring that it correctly calculates the time taken to leave the grid.

Given the analysis, the primary issue is with Function 1, which is not used correctly in the context of the problem. However, the main logic in Function 2 appears to be correct and sufficient to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Since Function 1 is not used correctly and its presence does not affect the overall correctness of the solution, the core logic in Function 2 is sufficient to solve the problem accurately.

**Correctness: **True**
