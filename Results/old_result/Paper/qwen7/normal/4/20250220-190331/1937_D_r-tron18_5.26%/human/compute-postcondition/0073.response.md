Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise equal to the length of `pre`; `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list containing indices `i+1` for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` excluding the last element if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes the last element; `suffZero` is a list containing the value `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `suffZero` including the current index (i+1); `ans` is a list of `n` zeros with `ans[i]` updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`; `i` is `i - 1 + 1 = i`; `el` is equal to `s1[i]`; `suffZero` is updated by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`; `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is equal to `2 * suffZero[-1]`; `oneInd` is the result of `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`; `fi` is the result of `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` and has been assigned to `fi`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is:
- `totalOne` remains unchanged.
- `s1` remains unchanged.
- `pre` remains unchanged.
- `preOne` remains unchanged.
- `suffZero` is updated by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`.
- `ans` is updated at index `i` to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `el` is updated to `s1[i]`.
- `suffZero` is updated by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`.
- `ol` remains unchanged.
- `zr` is updated to `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- `zeroInd` is updated to `2 * suffZero[-1]`.
- `oneInd` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- `fi` is updated to `oneInd`.
