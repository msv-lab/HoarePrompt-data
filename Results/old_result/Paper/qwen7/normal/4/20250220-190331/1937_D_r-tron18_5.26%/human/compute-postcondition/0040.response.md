Output State: **`ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `totalOne` to `ol` and the value of `len(suffZero) - 1` to `zr`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state includes these updated values for `ol` and `zr`, while keeping the other variables in their initial or unchanged states.
