Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summaries to understand its behavior and correctness.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
The function `func_2` is supposed to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. However, the function summary states that it computes a list `ans` representing the balance of '<' and '>' characters up to that position in the string. This is not directly related to the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

Given the complexity and the logic inside `func_2`, it appears that the function is trying to calculate something related to the balance of characters but not the actual time taken for the pinball to leave the grid. The function uses accumulations and other operations that do not align with the expected behavior of simulating the pinball's movement.

### Correct Simulation:
To correctly simulate the pinball's movement, we should:
1. Track the position of the pinball.
2. Update the direction of movement after each step.
3. Count the number of steps until the pinball leaves the grid.

Here is a simplified version of how the simulation should work:
```python
def simulate_pinball(s1, n):
    ans = []
    for i in range(n):
        pos = i
        steps = 0
        while 0 <= pos < n:
            steps += 1
            if s1[pos] == '<':
                s1[pos] = '>'
                pos -= 1
            else:
                s1[pos] = '<'
                pos += 1
        ans.append(steps)
    return ans
```

### Comparison with Provided Code:
The provided code uses complex accumulations and does not correctly simulate the pinball's movement. The function `func_2` does not follow the straightforward approach of tracking the pinball's position and updating the direction after each move.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided program does not correctly simulate the pinball's movement and the time taken to leave the grid. The function `func_2` does not accurately compute the required output as described in the problem statement.

Final: **False**
