Output State: **The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the index of `l` incremented by 1, and the second string is the index of `find` in the array incremented by 1.**

Given the initial state, we know:
- `l` and `r` are such that `r - l` is no longer greater than 1, indicating they are adjacent indices.
- `mid` was the last calculated midpoint during the loop's execution.
- The loop has terminated because `r - l` is no longer greater than 1.
- `l` and `find` do not have the same index in the array.

The code returns `[str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]`, which means:
- `l + 1` gives the index of `l` incremented by 1.
- `array.index(find) + 1` gives the index of `find` in the array incremented by 1.

Therefore, the program returns a list with these two values as strings.
