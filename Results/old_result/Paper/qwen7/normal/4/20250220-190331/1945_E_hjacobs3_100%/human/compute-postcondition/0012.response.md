Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `l` is now `(l + r) // 2`, `r` remains unchanged, and `mid` is now `(l + r) // 2`.**

Explanation: The line `l = mid` updates the value of `l` to be equal to `mid`, which is defined as `(l + r) // 2`. The values of `r` and `mid` remain unchanged.
