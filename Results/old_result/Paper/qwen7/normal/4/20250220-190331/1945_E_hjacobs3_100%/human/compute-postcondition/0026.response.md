Postcondition: **The array is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, `l` and `r` are such that `r - l` is no longer greater than 1, and `mid` is the last calculated midpoint value during the loop's execution. `l` and `r` point to two consecutive elements in the array, and `l` is equal to `array.index(find)`.**
