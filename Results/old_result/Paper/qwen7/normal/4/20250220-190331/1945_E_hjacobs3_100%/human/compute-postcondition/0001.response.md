Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, and `l` is 0, `r` is `n`.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `l` and `r` with the values 0 and `n`, respectively. The initial state of `array` as a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `l` and `r`, while keeping the initial state of `array` intact.
