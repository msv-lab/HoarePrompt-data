Postcondition: `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `l` and `r` are updated according to the conditions in the loop body, and `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`. If `array[mid] <= find`, then `l` is now equal to `mid` and `r - l > 1` still holds true. Otherwise, `l` remains unchanged, `r` is updated to `mid`, and `r - l > 1` still holds true.
