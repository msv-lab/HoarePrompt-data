Based on the initial state provided:

- The array is a list of integers representing a permutation of size \( n \).
- \( l \) and \( r \) are such that \( r - l \) is no longer greater than 1, meaning the loop has terminated because \( l \) and \( r \) are adjacent indices in the array.
- \( mid \) is the last calculated midpoint value during the loop's execution.
- The current value of \( l \) is not equal to the index of `find` in the array.

The print statement is simply `print(1)`. Since there are no variables being printed within this statement, it will directly print the integer 1.

Output: **1**
