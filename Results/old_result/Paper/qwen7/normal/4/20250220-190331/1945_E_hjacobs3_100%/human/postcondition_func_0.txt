The function accepts a list of integers `array` representing a permutation of size `n` and an integer `find` such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`. It performs a binary search to find the index of `find` in `array`. If `find` is not found, it prints "1" and returns a list containing the index of `l` incremented by 1 and the index of `find` in `array` incremented by 1. If `find` is found, it prints "0" and returns the same list as above.
