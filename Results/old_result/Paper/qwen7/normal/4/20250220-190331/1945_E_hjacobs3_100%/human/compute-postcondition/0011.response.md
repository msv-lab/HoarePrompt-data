Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `l` must be such that `r - l > 1`, `r` must be such that `r - l > 1`, `mid` is now `(l + r) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mid` to be the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
