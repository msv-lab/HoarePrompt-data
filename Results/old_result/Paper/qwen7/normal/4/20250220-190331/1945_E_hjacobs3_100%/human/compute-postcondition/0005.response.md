Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, `l` is `mid`, `r` is n, `mid` is (0 + n) // 2, and the value of `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is updated to be equal to `mid`. All other variables (`array`, `r`, `mid`, and the condition about `array[mid]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
