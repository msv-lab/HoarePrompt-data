Postcondition: `first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer, and `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 0. If `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `mpp[i] == 1 and first` is false, `i` remains unchanged and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
