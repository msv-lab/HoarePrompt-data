Output State: **`first` is False**.

Explanation: The variable `first` was initially set to `False`. The given code simply reassigns `first` to `False`, which does not change its value. Therefore, `first` remains `False`. The other variables (`i`, `arr`, and `mpp`) are not affected by this line of code.
