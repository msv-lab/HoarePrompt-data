You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and an array \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers. For each test case, it prints the first missing positive integer in the array or the first integer \( i \) for which there is exactly one occurrence in the array and the flag `first` has already been set to `True`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return anything but prints the results directly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to determine the game's final score (MEX of `c`) when both players play optimally.
   - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, then delete it from `a`.
   - Bob can only pick an element from `a` and delete it without appending to `c`.

2. **Optimal Strategy Analysis:**
   - Alice will try to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob will try to minimize the MEX of `c`.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - If there are duplicates in `a`, Alice can strategically pick them to ensure certain numbers do not appear in `c`.
   - Bob will remove elements from `a` but cannot influence the contents of `c` directly.

4. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The given code uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the range `[0, n+1)` to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the `Counter`.

5. **Issues in the Code:**
   - The code does not simulate the game turns correctly. It does not account for the alternating turns between Alice and Bob.
   - The logic to determine the MEX does not consider the optimal moves of both players.
   - The code assumes that the MEX can be determined just by counting occurrences, which is not sufficient for optimal play.

6. **Correct Approach:**
   - Alice will always pick unique elements first to ensure they do not appear in `c`.
   - Bob will remove elements, but since he cannot add to `c`, the MEX will be influenced by the remaining unique elements in `a`.

7. **Correct Solution:**
   - Count the occurrences of each element.
   - Determine the MEX by checking the smallest non-negative integer not present in the counts.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly simulate the game or determine the optimal MEX. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
