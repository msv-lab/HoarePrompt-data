Output State: **`first` is set to `True`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged, and `first` is `True`.**

Explanation: The variable `first` is explicitly set to `True`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and the variable `n` remains unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement is not directly affected by setting `first` to `True`, so the original postcondition remains valid.
