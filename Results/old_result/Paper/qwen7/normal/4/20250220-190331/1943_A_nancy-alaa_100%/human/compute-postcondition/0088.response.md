Output State: **`first` is False, `i` is an integer, and `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `first` to `True`. Since the initial state did not specify any particular value for `first` other than it being a boolean, and no other variables (`i` or `n`) were affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged. The only change is that `first` is now explicitly set to `True`, which is different from its initial unspecified state of being a boolean. However, since the problem asks to describe the output state based on the given conditions and the code does not alter `i` or `n`, these variables retain their initial postconditions.
