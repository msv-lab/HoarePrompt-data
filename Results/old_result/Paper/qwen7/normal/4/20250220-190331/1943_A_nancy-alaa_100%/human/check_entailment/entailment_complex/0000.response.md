Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing optimally on an array `a` to determine the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

2. **Optimal Strategy Analysis**:
   - Alice can always pick elements from `a` to ensure that the smallest missing integer (MEX) is maximized.
   - Bob can only remove elements from `a`, so his strategy is to minimize the MEX of `c`.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - If `a` contains all integers from `0` to `n-1` exactly once, Bob can force the MEX to be `1` by removing `0` and `1` alternately.
   - If `a` is missing some integers, Alice can strategically pick those missing integers to increase the MEX.

4. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It iterates through integers from `0` to `n` and checks if they are in the counter.
   - If an integer is not in the counter, it prints that integer as the MEX.
   - If an integer is in the counter exactly once and the `first` flag is `True`, it prints that integer as the MEX.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the smallest missing integer if all integers from `0` to `n-1` are present.
   - However, the logic does not handle the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob as described in the problem statement.
   - The code does not account for the fact that Alice can strategically pick elements to maximize the MEX, and Bob can minimize it by removing elements.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not implement the optimal strategy for both players.
   - Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
