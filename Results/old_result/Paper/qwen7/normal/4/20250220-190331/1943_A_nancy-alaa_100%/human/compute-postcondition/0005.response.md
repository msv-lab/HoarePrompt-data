State: **`first` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. The loop will execute as long as `n + 1` is greater than `i`, where `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
3. For the loop to start executing, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0 because if `n` is negative, `range(n + 1)` would generate an empty sequence, and the loop would not execute.
4. Initially, `i` is set to 0 by the `range` function.
5. The variable `first` is not directly involved in the loop's condition and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
