Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `first` is False
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if i not in mpp.keys():
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1:
        first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `first` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and if the current value of `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `mpp[i] == 1` is true, no change is made to the variables. If the condition `mpp[i] == 1` is false, no change is made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer, and `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 0. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the conditions remain as specified in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer, and `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 0. If `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is false, `i` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
