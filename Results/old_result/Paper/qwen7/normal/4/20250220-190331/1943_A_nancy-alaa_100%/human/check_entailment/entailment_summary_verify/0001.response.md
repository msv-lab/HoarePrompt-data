### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to determine the game's final score (MEX of `c`) when both players play optimally.
   - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, then delete it from `a`.
   - Bob can only pick an element from `a` and delete it without appending to `c`.

2. **Optimal Strategy Analysis:**
   - Alice will try to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob will try to minimize the MEX of `c`.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - If there are duplicates in `a`, Alice can strategically pick them to ensure certain numbers do not appear in `c`.
   - Bob will remove elements from `a` but cannot influence the contents of `c` directly.

4. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The given code uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the range `[0, n+1)` to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the `Counter`.

5. **Issues in the Code:**
   - The code does not simulate the game turns correctly. It does not account for the alternating turns between Alice and Bob.
   - The logic to determine the MEX does not consider the optimal moves of both players.
   - The code assumes that the MEX can be determined just by counting occurrences, which is not sufficient for optimal play.

6. **Correct Approach:**
   - Alice will always pick unique elements first to ensure they do not appear in `c`.
   - Bob will remove elements, but since he cannot add to `c`, the MEX will be influenced by the remaining unique elements in `a`.

7. **Correct Solution:**
   - Count the occurrences of each element.
   - Determine the MEX by checking the smallest non-negative integer not present in the counts.

8. **Analysis of the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly counts the occurrences of each element using `Counter`.
   - However, it does not simulate the game turns where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements.
   - The code simply finds the first missing positive integer or the first integer with exactly one occurrence after setting a flag. This does not reflect the optimal strategy for both players.

9. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code does not correctly simulate the game or determine the optimal MEX. It fails to account for the alternating turns and the strategic choices made by both players.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not simulate the game turns correctly and does not account for the optimal strategies of both players. The code simply finds the first missing positive integer or the first integer with exactly one occurrence, which is not sufficient for determining the optimal MEX in this game scenario.

Final: **False**
