Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.**

The code creates a `Counter` object named `mpp` which counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
