Output State: **`i` is an integer, `mpp` is a dictionary. The key `i` is not present in the dictionary `mpp`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i` or the dictionary `mpp`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the fact that we break out of the loop or conditional statement.
