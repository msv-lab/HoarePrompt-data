Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged, and `first` is `False`. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, if `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is `True`, then we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This holds true regardless of whether the condition `mpp[i] == 1` is met or not.
