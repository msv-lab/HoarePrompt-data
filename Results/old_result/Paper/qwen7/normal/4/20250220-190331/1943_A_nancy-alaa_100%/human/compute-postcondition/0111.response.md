Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `mpp` is a dictionary. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not a key in `mpp` or `mpp[i]` does not equal 1, no action is taken regarding breaking out of the loop or if statement.
