Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the board dimensions `r` (height), `w` (width), and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` respectively.

2. **Initial Comparison:**
   - The program checks if `a > c`. If true, it directly prints 'Draw'. This condition is not logically sound because it doesn't consider the game dynamics and the optimal moves of both players. It only checks a simple comparison which might not reflect the actual game state.

3. **Case 1: `a > c`:**
   - If `a > c`, the program prints 'Draw'. This logic is incorrect because it doesn't consider the game dynamics and the possible moves of both players. In fact, this condition should be more complex to handle the game rules properly.

4. **Case 2: `a <= c`:**
   - The program calculates `x = abs(a - c) // 2`.
   - It then checks if `abs(a - c) % 2` is non-zero (i.e., odd).
     - If `abs(a - c) % 2` is non-zero, it calculates the range `[l, r]` for Alice's possible moves.
     - It then checks if Bob's position `b` falls within the range `[l, r]` such that `abs(l - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - b) <= x + 1`.
       - If both conditions are met, it prints 'Alice'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.
   - If `abs(a - c) % 2` is zero, it calculates the range `[l, r]` for Bob's possible moves similarly.
     - It then checks if Alice's position `d` falls within the range `[l, r]` such that `abs(l - d) <= x` and `abs(r - d) <= x`.
       - If both conditions are met, it prints 'Bob'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Initial Condition:**
   - The initial condition `if a > c` is too simplistic and doesn't reflect the game dynamics. It should be handled more carefully considering the possible moves and the game rules.

2. **Range Calculation and Move Validation:**
   - The range calculation and move validation logic is somewhat correct but needs to be more robust to handle all edge cases and ensure optimal play.

3. **Edge Cases and Game Dynamics:**
   - The program doesn't fully account for all edge cases and the optimal strategies of both players. It assumes that the players will always make the best possible move, but the logic isn't comprehensive enough to cover all scenarios.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program is not fully correct and does not handle all possible scenarios optimally. Therefore, the program needs significant modifications to accurately determine the outcome of the game based on the given rules.

**Correctness: False**
