Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, and `t` is greater than 0; `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`; `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers assigned the values from the input split; `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2; the current value of `x` is odd; `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `r` to be the minimum of `w` and `d + x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `x` is calculated as the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, and it is mentioned that `x` is currently odd, which remains true. The value of `l` is also unchanged and is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`.
