Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), inclusive, and `t` is greater than 0.
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`.
   - `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers assigned the values from the input split.
   - `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, and the current value of `x` is odd.
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`.

2. **Values of Variables:**
   - Since `x` is odd and it is derived from the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, let's assume `a = 5` and `c = 7` (an example where the absolute difference is 2, so `x = 1`).
   - Given `x` is odd, let's assume `x = 1` (since it must be odd and the simplest case).

3. **Calculating Other Variables:**
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`. If `d` is any integer, `d - x` will be `d - 1`. For simplicity, let's assume `d = 3`, then `l = max(1, 3 - 1) = 2`.
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`. Assuming `w = 4` (an arbitrary value), `d + x = 3 + 1 = 4`, so `r = min(4, 4) = 4`.

4. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1])`.
   - Let's evaluate the condition inside the list indexing: `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`.
     - Assume `b = 2` (an arbitrary value).
     - `abs(l - b) = abs(2 - 2) = 0`, and `0 <= 1 + 1` is `True`.
     - `abs(r - b) = abs(4 - 2) = 2`, and `2 <= 1 + 1` is `False`.
     - Therefore, the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` evaluates to `False`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since the condition is `False`, the list index `[False]` selects the second element of the list `['Draw', 'Alice']`, which is `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
