Output State: **t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, the value of `t` remains within this range after the assignment. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
