Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `b + x`.
   - `w`, `b`, `x`, `a`, `c`, `d` are integers inputted from the user.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine `r`:**
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `b + x`.
   - Since `w`, `b`, and `x` are user inputs, `r` will be the smaller of these two values.

2. **Determine `l`:**
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.
   - If `b - x >= 1`, then `l = b - x`.
   - Otherwise, `l = 1`.

3. **Evaluate the Condition:**
   - The condition inside the print statement is `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x`.
   - We need to check if both parts of this condition are true:
     - `abs(l - d) <= x`
     - `abs(r - d) <= x`

4. **Print Statement:**
   - If the condition is true, the print statement will output `['Draw']`.
   - If the condition is false, the print statement will output `['Bob']`.

### Detailed Explanation:

- Let's assume specific values for `w`, `b`, `x`, `a`, `c`, `d` (since they are user inputs, we can choose any valid values):
  - Suppose `w = 5`, `b = 3`, `x = 2`, `a = 10`, `c = 8`, `d = 4`.
  - Then, `r = min(5, 3 + 2) = min(5, 5) = 5`.
  - And, `l = max(1, 3 - 2) = max(1, 1) = 1`.

- Now, evaluate the condition:
  - `abs(l - d) = abs(1 - 4) = 3`, and `3 <= x` (since `x = 2` is false).
  - `abs(r - d) = abs(5 - 4) = 1`, and `1 <= x` (since `x = 2` is true).

- Since the first part of the condition (`abs(l - d) <= x`) is false, the entire condition is false.

### Final Output:
- Therefore, the print statement will output `['Bob']`.

Output: **['Bob']**
