Output State: **`r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, and `l` retain their original values.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to be the minimum of `w` and `d + x`. This directly changes the value of `r`.
- The values of `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states because they are not reassigned or otherwise modified by the given code.
