Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, and `t` is greater than 0; `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers assigned the values from the input split; `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2.**

This means that `x` is updated to the value of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, while all other variables retain their initial values.
