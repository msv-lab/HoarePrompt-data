Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, and t is greater than 0; `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers assigned the values from the input split.**

This means that `t` retains its original properties (an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, and greater than 0), while `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are assigned integer values from the input split using the `map` function.
