Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `n + 1`; `a` is a list with three elements where the first two elements are the inputs from the user and the third element is the latest input from the user; `first_row` is updated by adding the first element of the second sublist in `a` and then adding the first element of the last sublist in `a`; `last_row` is updated by adding the last element of the second sublist in `a` and then incrementing it by the last element of the last sublist in `a`.**

Explanation: The code updates `first_row` by adding the first element of the last sublist in `a` to the current value of `first_row`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of the elements in `a`, we keep the general description. The other variables remain unchanged.
