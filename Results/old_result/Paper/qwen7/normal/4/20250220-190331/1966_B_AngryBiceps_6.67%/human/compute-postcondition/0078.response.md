Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `n + 1`; `a` is a list with three elements where the first two elements are the inputs from the user and the third element is the latest input from the user; `first_row` is updated by adding the first element of the second sublist in `a` and then adding the first element of the last sublist in `a`; `last_row` is updated by adding the last element of the second sublist in `a` and then incrementing it by the last element of the last sublist in `a`; `last_row` is increased by the last element of the last sublist in `a`.**

In more detail, the code updates `last_row` by adding the last element of the last sublist in `a` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
