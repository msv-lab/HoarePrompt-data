Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid of size n × m where n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500. The grid is filled with 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters. For each test case, identified by a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the function determines the count of 'W' and 'B' characters in the grid and returns the count of 'W' characters if the sum of n·m over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.**
