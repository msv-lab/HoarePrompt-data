Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `n + 1`; `a` is a list with three elements where the first two elements are the inputs from the user and the third element is the latest input from the user; `first_row` is updated by adding the first element of the second sublist in `a`; `last_row` is updated by adding the last element of the second sublist in `a` and then incrementing it by the last element of the last sublist in `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends the latest input from the user to the list `a`. Since `a` originally had two elements (the first element being an input from the user and the second element being another input from the user), after appending the latest input, `a` now has three elements. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `first_row`, and `last_row`) remain unchanged according to the initial state and the code provided.
