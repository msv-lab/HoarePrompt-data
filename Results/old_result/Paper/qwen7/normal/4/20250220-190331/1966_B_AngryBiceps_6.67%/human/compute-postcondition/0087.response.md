Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `a` is a list containing all the inputs provided by the user up to the `(n-1)`th iteration.
- `first_row` is a string composed of the first character of each sublist in `a`, concatenated in the order they appear in `a`.
- `last_row` is a string composed of the last character of each sublist in `a`, concatenated in the order they appear in `a`, with each subsequent character being the sum (concatenation) of the last characters of the corresponding sublists in `a`.
- The first element of `a[0]` is composed of a single unique character, or `a[0]` is not equal to the last element `a[-1]`.

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
