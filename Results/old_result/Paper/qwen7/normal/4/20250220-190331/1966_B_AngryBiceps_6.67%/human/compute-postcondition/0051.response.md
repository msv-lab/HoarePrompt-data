Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`, where `n` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input from the user.
- `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each string in the list `a`.
- `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each string in the list `a`, repeated according to its position in the list.
- The first element of `a` consists of only one unique character.
- The last element of `a` is different from the first element of `a`.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
