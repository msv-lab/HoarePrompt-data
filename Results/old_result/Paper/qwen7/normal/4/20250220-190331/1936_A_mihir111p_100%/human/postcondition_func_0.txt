The function `func_1` accepts four non-negative integer parameters \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) within the range \([0, n)\), where \(n\) is a positive integer between 2 and \(10^4\). It prints these parameters and then returns an input value provided by the user, which is also a non-negative integer within the same range \([0, n)\).
