### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement and the provided example.

1. **Initialization and First Query:**
   - The program iterates over `ans1` from 1 to `n-1` and performs a query with `func_1(ans1, ans1, i, i)`. This is likely to find the smallest index `i` such that `(p_i | p_i)` is greater than `(p_ans1 | p_ans1)`. However, this part seems redundant since it always compares the same index with itself.

2. **Finding Maximum OR Value:**
   - The program initializes `mx` to 0 and `v` to `[0]`. It then iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-1` and performs a query with `func_1(mx, ans1, i, ans1)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it resets `v` to an empty list and sets `mx` to `i` and appends `i` to `v`.
   - If the result is `=`, it simply appends `i` to `v`.

3. **Selecting Maximum Index from Candidates:**
   - The program selects the first element of `v` as `mx` and then iterates over the rest of `v` to find the maximum index `ans` such that `(p_ans | p_ans) > (p_v[i] | p_v[i])`.

4. **Outputting the Result:**
   - Finally, the program prints the indices `ans` and `ans1` as the answer.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Redundant Query:**
   - The first loop (`for i in range(1, n):`) is unnecessary and redundant. It doesn't contribute to finding the optimal indices.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Maximum OR:**
   - The logic for finding the maximum OR value is flawed. It only considers indices where `p_i | p_ans1` is compared with `p_ans1 | p_ans1`. This does not guarantee that the maximum OR value is found.

3. **Query Efficiency:**
   - The program makes more than 3n queries in some cases, which violates the problem constraints.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The program should output the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized, but the current implementation does not ensure this.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
