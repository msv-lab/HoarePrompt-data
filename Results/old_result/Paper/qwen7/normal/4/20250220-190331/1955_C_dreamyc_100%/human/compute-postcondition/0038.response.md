Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function returns either the value of `n` or the count of indices `i` (from `0` to `n-1`) where the sum of the first `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `a` (math.ceil(k / 2)) and the sum of the last `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `b` (k // 2).**
