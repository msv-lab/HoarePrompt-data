    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is the sum of `1` for every `i` from `0` to `n-1` where `s_a` (which is the cumulative sum of `nums[i]` from `0` to `i`) is less than or equal to `a` and `s_b` (which is the cumulative sum of `nums[n-i-1]` from `n-1` to `n-i-1`) is less than or equal to `b`. `s_b` is the cumulative sum of `nums[n-i-1]` from `n-1` to `0`, and `i` is `n`. `s_a` is the cumulative sum of `nums[i]` from `0` to `n-1`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `ans` will be the count of indices `i` where the sum of the first `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `a` and the sum of the last `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `b`. The variable `s_b` will hold the sum of all elements in `nums`, and `i` will be equal to `n` after all iterations.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is the count of indices `i` (from `0` to `n-1`) where the sum of the first `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `a` (`math.ceil(k / 2)`) and the sum of the last `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `b` (`k // 2`).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer indicating the length of the list `nums`, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers. The function returns either the value of `n` or the count of indices `i` (from `0` to `n-1`) where the sum of the first `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `a` (which is `math.ceil(k / 2)`) and the sum of the last `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `b` (which is `k // 2`). If the sum of all elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `k`, the function returns `n`. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the count of such indices `i`.
