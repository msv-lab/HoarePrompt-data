Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the logic used to determine the number of ships sunk is flawed. Let's break down the issue:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Sunk Ships**: The current implementation tries to count the number of ships that would be sunk based on the sum of the durability values up to the point where the Kraken attacks. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the alternating attack pattern (first ship, then last ship, and so on).

2. **Simplification of Attack Pattern**: Instead of trying to calculate the exact number of ships sunk using sums, we should simulate the attack process step-by-step to accurately determine which ships sink and when.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    queue = deque(range(1, n + 1))
    sunk_ships = 0

    for _ in range(k):
        if queue:
            first_ship = queue.popleft()
            if nums[first_ship - 1] > 0:
                nums[first_ship - 1] -= 1
                if nums[first_ship - 1] == 0:
                    sunk_ships += 1
            if queue:
                last_ship = queue.pop()
                if nums[last_ship - 1] > 0:
                    nums[last_ship - 1] -= 1
                    if nums[last_ship - 1] == 0:
                        sunk_ships += 1

    print(sunk_ships)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
1. **Queue Initialization**: We use a `deque` to represent the order of the ships.
2. **Simulated Attacks**: For each attack, we check the first and last ships in the queue. If their durability is greater than 0, we reduce their durability by 1. If a ship's durability reaches 0, it is considered sunk and we increment the `sunk_ships` counter.
3. **Repeat Until All Attacks**: We repeat this process for `k` attacks.

This approach ensures that the program correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks and counts the number of ships that sink.
