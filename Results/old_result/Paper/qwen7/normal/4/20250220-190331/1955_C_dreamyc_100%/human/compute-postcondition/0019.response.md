Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
   - `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\)
   - `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)
   - `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`
   - `b` is `k // 2`
   - `ans` is either 1 or 2
   - `s_b` is `nums[n - 1]`
   - `i` is 2
   - `s_a` is `nums[0]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `s_b` is `nums[n - 1]`, `i` is 3, `s_a` is `nums[0]`**
