Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is 3 (since it was originally 1 and was incremented by 1), `s_b` is `nums[n - 1] + nums[n - 5]`, `i` is 4, `s_a` is `nums[0] + nums[3]`**.
