### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes no arguments but relies on the global variables `n` and `k` set in the loop.
   - It constructs a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets repeated `n` times.
   - The string `s` is returned.

3. **String Construction:**
   - The string `s` is constructed as `s[:k] * n`, which means it repeats the substring of the first `k` characters of `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` exactly `n` times.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the example input `n=2` and `k=3`.
     - The string `s` will be `"abcabc"`.
     - However, this string does not contain all possible subsequences of length 2 using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets (`"aa"`, `"ab"`, `"ac"`, `"ba"`, `"bb"`, `"bc"`, `"ca"`, `"cb"`, `"cc"`).

5. **De Bruijn Sequence:**
   - A de Bruijn sequence for alphabet size `k` and length `n` is a cyclic sequence in which every possible string of length `n` appears as a substring.
   - The given program does not generate a de Bruijn sequence; instead, it simply repeats a prefix of the alphabet `n` times.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program fails to ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are included in the generated string `s`.
   - Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate. The program does not generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.
