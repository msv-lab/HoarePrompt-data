Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which denotes the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not implemented in the provided code snippet.

3. **Implementation of `func_1()`**:
   - The function `func_1()` is supposed to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.
   - However, the implementation provided in the code is:
     ```python
     def func_1():
         (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
         s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
         return s[:k] * n
     ```
   - This implementation does not correctly solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:
     - It reads `n` and `k` from the input.
     - It creates a string `s` containing all 26 lowercase English alphabets.
     - It returns a string consisting of the first `k` characters of `s`, repeated `n` times.
     - This approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem, we need to construct a string `s` that includes all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.
   - One efficient way to do this is to use a de Bruijn sequence, which is a cyclic sequence that contains every possible subsequence of a given length over a specified alphabet exactly once.

5. **Example for Verification**:
   - For the example given in the problem:
     - For `n=1` and `k=2`, the output should be "ab" (as shown).
     - For `n=2` and `k=1`, the output should be "aa".
     - For `n=2` and `k=2`, the output should be "baab".
     - For `n=2` and `k=3`, the output should be "abcbac".

### Conclusion

The provided implementation in the code snippet is incorrect because it does not generate the required string `s`. Therefore, the given program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **False**
