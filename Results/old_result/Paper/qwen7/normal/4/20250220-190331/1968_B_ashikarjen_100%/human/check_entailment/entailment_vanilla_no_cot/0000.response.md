Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in how it determines the maximum prefix length `k` of string `a` that forms a subsequence of string `b`. The issue lies in the way the index `j` is incremented. Specifically, when `b[j] != a[i]`, the code increments `j` but continues to check the same character in the next iteration, which can lead to incorrect results.

To fix this, we should ensure that `j` only increments once per character match in `a`. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        # Find the next occurrence of a[i] in b starting from j
        next_index = b.find(a[i], j)
        if next_index != -1:
            k += 1
            j = next_index + 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)
    return
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- **`next_index = b.find(a[i], j)`**: This finds the next occurrence of `a[i]` in `b` starting from index `j`.
- **`if next_index != -1:`**: If the character is found, increment `k` and update `j` to the next index after the found character.
- **`else:`**: If the character is not found, break out of the loop since no further matching prefix can be formed.

This ensures that the solution correctly calculates the maximum prefix length `k` such that the prefix of `a` up to length `k` is a subsequence of `b`.
