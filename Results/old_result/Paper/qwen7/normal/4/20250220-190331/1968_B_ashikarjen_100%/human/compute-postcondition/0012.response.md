Output State: **`k` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 3, `a` is the first line of input, `b` is a string input, `j` is 4, and `b[2] != a[i]`**.

The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
