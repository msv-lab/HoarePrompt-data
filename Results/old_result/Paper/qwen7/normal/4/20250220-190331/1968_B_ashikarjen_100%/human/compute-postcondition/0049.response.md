Output State: **`k` is 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is `j + 1`, and `b[j]` is never equal to `a[i]` for any index `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`. Additionally, `j` is less than `m`.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`k`, `m`, and the condition about `b[j]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `j` is now `j + 1`, while all other conditions and values remain as they were initially.
