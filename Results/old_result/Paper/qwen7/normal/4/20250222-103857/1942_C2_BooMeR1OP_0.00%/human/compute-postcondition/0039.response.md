Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 1, `next_elem` is `a[2 % x] + (n if 2 == x - 1 else 0)`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[2] - 1`, `gap` is updated to `next_elem - a[i] - 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `gap` to `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `gap` is now calculated as `next_elem - a[2] - 1`. Since `next_elem` is defined as `a[2 % x] + (n if 2 == x - 1 else 0)`, and `i` is 2, the value of `next_elem` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated `gap` is `next_elem - a[2] - 1`. All other variables remain in their initial or defined states.
