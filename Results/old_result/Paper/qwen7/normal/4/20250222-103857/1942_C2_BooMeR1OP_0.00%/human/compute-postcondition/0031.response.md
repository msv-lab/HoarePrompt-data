Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[1 % x] + n` if `x` is greater than 1, otherwise it is `a[0]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `gap` as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, `x` must be greater than 0, and `next_elem` is defined as `a[1 % x] + n` if `x` is greater than 1, otherwise it is `a[0]`. The value of `a[i]` is `a[1]` since `i` is 1. However, the exact value of `a[1]` or `a[0]` is not specified, so `next_elem` remains as defined. The value of `gap` is then calculated based on the definition of `next_elem` and the value of `a[1]`.
