Output State: **`i` is equal to `x`, `ans` is equal to `x`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `gaps` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `gaps` as an empty list. The values of `i`, `ans`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged from their previous states since no operations are performed on them within the given code snippet. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `i` and `ans` as `x`, and `t1` and `t2` as `(a[x-1] + 1) % n` and `(a[x-1] + 2) % n` respectively, while adding that `gaps` is now an empty list.
