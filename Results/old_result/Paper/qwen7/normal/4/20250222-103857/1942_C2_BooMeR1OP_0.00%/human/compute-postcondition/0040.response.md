Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 1, `next_elem` is `a[2 % x] + (n if 2 == x - 1 else 0)`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[2] - 1`, `gap` is updated to `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, `gaps` is a list containing one element which is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `gap` to the list `gaps`. Since `i` is 2, `gap` is updated to `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, which is `next_elem - a[2] - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
