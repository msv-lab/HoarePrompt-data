Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(x)`. The only variables involved here are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 2
   - `ans` is 2
   - `t1` is `(a[2] + 1) % n`
   - `t2` is `(a[2] + 2) % n`
   - The postcondition is that if `t1` is not in `present` and `t2` is in `present`, then `ans` is updated to 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i = 3`.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to 3.
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` remains unchanged because the postcondition did not update it based on the given values of `t1` and `t2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `ans` is 2, `t1` is `(a[2] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[2] + 2) % n`**
