Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and `x`. These are the only variables that can be adjusted according to the loop head.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `ans` is 1 (This variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)
   - `t1` is `(a[0] + 1) % n` and is not in `present` (This variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)
   - `t2` is `(a[0] + 2) % n` and is in `present` (This variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)

3. **Determine the Next State for the Loop to Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `x`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented to 2.
   - Since `i` is incremented within the loop, the new value of `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `ans` is 1, `t1` is (a[0] + 1) % n and is not in `present`, `t2` is (a[0] + 2) % n and is in `present`**
