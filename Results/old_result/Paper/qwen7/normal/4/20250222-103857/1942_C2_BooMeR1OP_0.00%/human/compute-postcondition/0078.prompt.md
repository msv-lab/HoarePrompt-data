Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After sorting, the variable `gaps` contains a sorted list of all positive differences between consecutive elements in the array `a` modulo `n`, provided these differences are greater than 0. The variables `i`, `ans`, `t1`, and `t2` retain their initial values.
Code of the loop:
for gap in gaps:
    pairs = gap // 2
    if y >= pairs:
        ans += gap
        y -= pairs
    else:
        ans += 2 * y
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `gaps` is a sorted list of all positive differences between consecutive elements in the array `a` modulo `n`, provided these differences are greater than 0, `i` retains its initial value, `ans` is incremented by either `gap` (if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`) or increased by 2 times the value of `y` (if `y` is less than `pairs`), `t1` retains its initial value, `t2` is now equal to `gap // 2`, and `y` is adjusted accordingly.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `gaps` is a sorted list of all positive differences between consecutive elements in the array `a` modulo `n`, `i` retains its initial value, `ans` is incremented by either the value of `gap` (if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`) or increased by 2 times the value of `y` (if `y` is less than `pairs`), `t1` retains its initial value, `t2` is now equal to `gap // 2`, `pairs` is now equal to `gap // 2`, and `y` is adjusted accordingly. If `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`, `ans` is incremented by `gap`; otherwise, `ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `gaps` is a sorted list of all positive differences between consecutive elements in the array `a` modulo `n`, `i` retains its initial value, `ans` is incremented by either the value of `gap` (if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`) or 2 times the value of `y` (if `y` is less than `pairs`), `t1` retains its initial value, `t2` is now equal to `gap // 2`, `pairs` is now equal to `gap // 2`, and `y` is adjusted accordingly.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
