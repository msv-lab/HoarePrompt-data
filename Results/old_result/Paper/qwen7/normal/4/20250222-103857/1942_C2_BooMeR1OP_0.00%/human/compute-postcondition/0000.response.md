Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 ⋅ 10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that the values of `t`, which was previously defined, remain unchanged, and new values for `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned based on the input. The constraints for these variables are specified in the initial state, and they are updated accordingly.
