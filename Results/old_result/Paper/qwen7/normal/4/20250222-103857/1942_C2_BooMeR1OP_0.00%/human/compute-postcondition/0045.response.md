Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` must be greater than 1, `next_elem` is `a[4 % x] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1` else `a[4 % x]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `gap` as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. Since `i` is 3, `a[i]` is `a[3]`. The value of `next_elem` depends on whether `i` equals `x - 1`. However, since `i` is 3 and `x` must be greater than 1, `i` does not equal `x - 1` (because `x - 1` would be at least 0). Therefore, `next_elem` is `a[4 % x]`. So, `gap` is calculated as `a[4 % x] - a[3] - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
