Output State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is `k - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum of the new `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += a[i]` increments `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `ans`, `ans1`, and `ans2`) are updated as per their previous conditions. Specifically, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is decremented by 1 and must remain greater than 0, and `ans` is updated to be the maximum of the new `ans1` and `ans2`.
