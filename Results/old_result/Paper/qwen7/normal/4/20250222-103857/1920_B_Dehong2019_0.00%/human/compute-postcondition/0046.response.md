Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `x` (which is used in the range function).

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `x-1`, so the loop condition is `i < x`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `k + 1`.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Formulate the New State**: The new state should reflect that `i` is now `k + 1` and `x` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[k - 1] + a[i] * 2`**
