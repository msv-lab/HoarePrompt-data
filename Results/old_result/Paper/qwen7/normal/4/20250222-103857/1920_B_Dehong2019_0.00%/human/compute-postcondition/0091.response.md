Output State: **`ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`, where `i` is `x`; `i` plus `x` is less than `n`; `k` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code subtracts twice the value of `a[i + x]` from `ans1`. Given that `i` is `x`, the updated value of `ans1` is `ans1 - 2 * a[x + x]` or `ans1 - 2 * a[2x]`. The conditions for `i`, `x`, and `k` remain unchanged.
