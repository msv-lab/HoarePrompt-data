Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and for each test case, `n`, `k`, and `x` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ `x`, `k` ≤ `n`; and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000. Additionally, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The conditions and constraints for `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged and are still valid for each test case.
