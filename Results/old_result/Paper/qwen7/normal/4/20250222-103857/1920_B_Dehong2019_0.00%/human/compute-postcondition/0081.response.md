Output State: **`i` is 2; `ans1` is `ans1 - a[2] * 2`**

Explanation: The initial state is `i` is 2, and `ans1` is `ans1 - a[1] * 2`. The code updates `ans1` by subtracting `a[i] * 2` from it. Since `i` is 2, `a[i]` refers to `a[2]`. Therefore, `ans1` is updated to `ans1 - a[2] * 2`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
