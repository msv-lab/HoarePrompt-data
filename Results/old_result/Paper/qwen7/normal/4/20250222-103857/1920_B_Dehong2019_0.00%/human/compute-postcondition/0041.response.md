Output State: **`n` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `x` is an integer input, `i` is equal to `k - 1`, `ans1` is the sum of the entire list `a`, `ans2` retains its initial value, and `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 = sum(a)` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to `ans1`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `x`, `i`, `ans2`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
