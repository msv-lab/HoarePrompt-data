Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `k-1`, `ans1` is either decreased by `2 * a[i + x]` (if `i + x < n`) or increased by `a[i + 1]` (if `i + x >= n`), `ans2` is equal to `ans1`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans1, ans2)` does not change the values of `i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, or `ans` directly. It simply assigns the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` to `ans`. Since `ans2` is already equal to `ans1`, `ans` will be equal to `ans1` (or `ans2`). The conditions for updating `ans1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the same conditions as the initial state, with `ans` now being the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
