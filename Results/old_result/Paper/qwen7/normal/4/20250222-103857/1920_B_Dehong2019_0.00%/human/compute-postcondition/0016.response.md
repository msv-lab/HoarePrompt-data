Output State: **`ans1` is increased by the value of `a[i]`, and `i` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += a[i]` increments the value of `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. The index `i` is used to access an element in the list `a`, but the value of `i` itself is not modified by this operation. Therefore, `i` remains unchanged, while `ans1` is updated to include the value of `a[i]`.
