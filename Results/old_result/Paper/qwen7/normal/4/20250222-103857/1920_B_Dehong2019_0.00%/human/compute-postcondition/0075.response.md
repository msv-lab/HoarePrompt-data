Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `i` is `(i + 1) % k`, `ans1` is the sum of `a[0]` to `a[k-1]` with adjustments based on the value of `x` and the condition `i + x < n`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `x` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and `ans` directly. The values of `i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and `ans` remain as they were in the initial state. The new values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are stored in their respective variables.
