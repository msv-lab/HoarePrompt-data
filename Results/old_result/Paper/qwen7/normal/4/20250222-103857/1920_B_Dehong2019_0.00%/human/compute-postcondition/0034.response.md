Output State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, `i` is `i + 2`, and `ans` is equal to the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code `ans = max(ans1, ans2)` does not change the values of `ans1`, `i`, or `ans2`. It only assigns the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` to `ans`. Therefore, the values of `ans1`, `i`, and `ans2` remain unchanged from their previous states. The only change is that `ans` now holds the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.
