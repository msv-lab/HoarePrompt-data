Output State: **`ans1` is decreased by `a[i + x] * 2`, `i` is increased by 2, and `ans` is equal to the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code subtracts twice the value of `a[i + x]` from `ans1`. The values of `i` and `ans` remain unchanged from their previous states, except that `i` is incremented by 2 due to the line `i += 2` being implied in the initial state. The value of `ans` continues to be the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
