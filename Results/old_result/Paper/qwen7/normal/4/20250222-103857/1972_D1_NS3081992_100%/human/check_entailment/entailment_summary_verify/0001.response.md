### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the function `func_15` seems to produce the correct results for the given examples. However, the logic in `func_15` does not directly address the problem statement. Let's break down the problem and the function to understand why the original assessment might be inaccurate.

#### Problem Statement Recap
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Function `func_15` Analysis
The function `func_15` iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\) and for each \(i\), it adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\) to `ans`. This approach does not directly solve the problem as stated. Instead, it appears to be a heuristic or approximation method rather than a direct solution.

Let's consider the following example to illustrate why this approach is incorrect:

#### Counterexample
Consider \(n = 4\) and \(m = 2\):

- Valid pairs:
  - \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(2 \mod (1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1)) = 0\)
  - \((2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) and \(3 \mod (1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1)) = 0\)
  - \((3, 1)\): \(3 + 1 = 4\) and \(4 \mod (1 \cdot \gcd(3, 1)) = 0\)
  - \((4, 1)\): \(4 + 1 = 5\) and \(5 \mod (1 \cdot \gcd(4, 1)) = 0\)

So, there are 4 valid pairs.

Now, let's run `func_15` with \(n = 4\) and \(m = 2\):

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1

# Input: 4 2
print(func_15())
```

Running this code will give us:

- For \(i = 1\): \(\left\lfloor \frac{4 + 1}{1^2} \right\rfloor = 5\)
- For \(i = 2\): \(\left\lfloor \frac{4 + 2}{2^2} \right\rfloor = 1\)

So, `ans = 5 + 1 - 1 = 5`, which is incorrect.

#### Correct Approach
A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).

### Conclusion
The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_15` does not correctly solve the problem. The given function is a heuristic and does not cover all valid pairs.

### Final Answer
Final: **False**
