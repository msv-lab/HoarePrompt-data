### Reasoning

The original assessment concludes that the function `func_15` produces correct results for the given test cases. However, the logic in `func_15` does not directly solve the problem as stated. Let's carefully analyze the problem and the given solution to determine if the function is indeed correct.

#### Problem Restatement
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Given Solution Analysis
The function `func_15` iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\) and for each \(i\), it adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\) to `ans`. This approach does not directly address the problem statement. Let's break down why this might be incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Assumption**: The function assumes that for each \(i\), the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) can be approximated by \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\). This is not a valid assumption because the problem requires checking the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) = 0\) for each pair \((a, b)\).

2. **Missing Key Condition**: The function does not explicitly check the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) = 0\). Instead, it uses a heuristic that counts multiples of \(i^2\) in \(n + i\), which is not equivalent to the required condition.

3. **Example Verification**: While the function produces correct results for the given test cases, it is important to note that the correctness of the function is based on empirical testing rather than a rigorous proof. Without a formal proof, we cannot guarantee that the function will work for all possible inputs.

### Detailed Counterexample
Consider the test case \(n = 4\), \(m = 4\):

- Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 1)\), \((4, 2)\), \((4, 4)\)
- Expected output: 8

Using the function `func_15`:
- For \(i = 1\): \(\left\lfloor \frac{4 + 1}{1^2} \right\rfloor = 5\)
- For \(i = 2\): \(\left\lfloor \frac{4 + 2}{2^2} \right\rfloor = 1\)
- For \(i = 3\): \(\left\lfloor \frac{4 + 3}{3^2} \right\rfloor = 0\)
- For \(i = 4\): \(\left\lfloor \frac{4 + 4}{4^2} \right\rfloor = 0\)

Summing these values gives \(5 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 6\), which is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The function `func_15` does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The heuristic approach used in the function is not valid for the given problem constraints.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect based on the detailed analysis and counterexample provided.
