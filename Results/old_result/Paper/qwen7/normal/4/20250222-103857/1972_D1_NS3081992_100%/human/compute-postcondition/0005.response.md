Output State: **`sys.stdout.write` writes the value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline character, and `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0**.

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` writes the value returned by `func_15()` converted to a string, followed by a newline character. The precondition that `sys.stdout.write` writes the value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline character remains valid. Additionally, the precondition that `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0 is also still valid and unaffected by the code execution.
