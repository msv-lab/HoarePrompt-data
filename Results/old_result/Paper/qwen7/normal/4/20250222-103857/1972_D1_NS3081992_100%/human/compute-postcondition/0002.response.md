Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for _ in range(func_10())`. The variables involved in this loop head are the return value of `func_10()` and the underscore `_`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `func_10()` returns a positive integer (greater than 0).

3. **State at the end of the previous iteration**: It is given that `func_15()` returns a value greater than 0. However, the loop is controlled by `func_10()`, not `func_15()`.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a positive integer. Since the loop continues based on the return value of `func_10()`, we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer when the loop starts.

5. **Formulate the new state**: Based on the above points, the state needs to be adjusted such that `func_10()` returns a positive integer when the loop starts.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`func_10()` returns a value greater than 0**
