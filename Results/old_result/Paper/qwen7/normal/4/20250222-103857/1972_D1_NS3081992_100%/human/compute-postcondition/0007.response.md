Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer representing the number of test cases (t), where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it processes two integers n and m, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6, and returns an integer representing the number of valid pairs for that test case. The sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.**
