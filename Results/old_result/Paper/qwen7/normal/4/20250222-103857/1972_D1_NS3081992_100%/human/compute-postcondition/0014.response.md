Output State: **The program returns the value of `ans` minus 1, where `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to the smallest integer greater than or equal to the square root of `n + m`, with `n` and `m` being the return values of `func_7()` and `ans` being calculated as described.**

This means that the program first calculates `n` and `m` as the return values of `func_7()`. It then computes `i`, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the square root of `n + m`. Using this `i`, it calculates `ans` by summing up the expression `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to `i`. Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.
