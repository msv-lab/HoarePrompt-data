You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers; processing is a list of length equal to the maximum key in d, initialized with zeros; da is an integer which is a key in the dictionary d; rank is a list of integers with the same length as the maximum key in d, initialized with zeros.
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if (len(d[da]) == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers; `processing` is a list of length equal to the maximum key in `d`, initialized with zeros; `da` is an integer which is a key in the dictionary `d`; `rank` is a list of integers with the same length as the maximum key in `d`, initialized with zeros; `tmp` is 1000000000; the length of `d[da]` is greater than 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
        
    #State: Output State: The dictionary `d` remains unchanged, `processing` is a list of length equal to the maximum key in `d`, with all elements set to zero, `da` is an integer which is a key in the dictionary `d`, `rank` is a list of integers with the same length as the maximum key in `d`, with all elements set to zero, `tmp` is the minimum value obtained from repeatedly calling `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` during the entire execution of the loop, and `di` has iterated through all elements in `d[da]`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the dictionary `d` and the list `da` remain unchanged. The `processing` list still contains zeros everywhere. The `rank` list also remains unchanged. The variable `tmp` holds the smallest value returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for any `di` in `d[da]` over all iterations of the loop. The variable `di` has gone through every element in `d[da]`.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #`The program returns the value of tmp + 1, where tmp is the minimum value obtained from repeatedly calling func_12(d, processing, di, rank) for each di in d[da] during the entire execution of the loop`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of the same length as the maximum key in `d`, initialized with zeros, an integer `da` which is a key in the dictionary `d`, and a list `rank` of the same length as the maximum key in `d`, initialized with zeros. The function returns 1 in Case_1. In Case_2, the function returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value obtained from repeatedly calling `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` during the entire execution of the loop.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1

Case_2: `The program returns the value of tmp + 1, where tmp is the minimum value obtained from repeatedly calling func_12(d, processing, di, rank) for each di in d[da] during the entire execution of the loop`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
