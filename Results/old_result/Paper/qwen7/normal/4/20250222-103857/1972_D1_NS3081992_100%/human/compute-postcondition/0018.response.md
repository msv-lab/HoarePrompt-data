Postcondition: **`i` will be equal to `n`, `n` will remain unchanged, and `k` will be updated based on the condition `a[i] < m` for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`. Specifically, for each index `i` where `a[i]` is less than `m`, `k` will be decreased by the amount `m - a[i]`. Additionally, `k` will be less than 0.**
