Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `x`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 21
   - `x` must be greater than or equal to 0
   - There is an additional condition involving `l[l[i] - 1]` and `i + 1`, but this condition is outside the loop head.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - Since `i` is currently 21, the next value of `i` will be 22.
   - The condition `x` must be greater than or equal to 0 remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop itself.

Given these points, we can conclude that the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `x`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 22, `x` must be greater than or equal to 0**
