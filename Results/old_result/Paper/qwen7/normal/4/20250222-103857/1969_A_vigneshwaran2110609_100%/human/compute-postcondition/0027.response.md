Output State: **`i` is 10, `x` is an input integer greater than 9, `n` must be greater than 9, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

The code creates a list `l` by taking an input string, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace, splitting the string into elements based on spaces, and then converting each element to an integer using the `map` function. The original values of `i`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged, but now `l` holds the list of integers from the input.
