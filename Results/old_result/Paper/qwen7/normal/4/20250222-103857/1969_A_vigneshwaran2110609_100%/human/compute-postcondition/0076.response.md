Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three values: `t`, `n`, and `p`. For each test case, it reads `n` integers from input, checks if the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` holds for any index `i` within the range 0 to `x-1`, and prints 2 if the condition is met for any index. If the condition is not met for any index, it prints 3. The function does not return any value.**
