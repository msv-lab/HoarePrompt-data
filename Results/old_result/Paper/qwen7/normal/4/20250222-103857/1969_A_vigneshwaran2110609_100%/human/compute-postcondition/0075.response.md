Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case defined by three values: `t`, `n`, and `p`. It verifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 5000, `n` is an integer within the range 2 to 50, and `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` but not equal to its index. The function does not return any value explicitly but checks the validity of the input according to the given constraints.**
