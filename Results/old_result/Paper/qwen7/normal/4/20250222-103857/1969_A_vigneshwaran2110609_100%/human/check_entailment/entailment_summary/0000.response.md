Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations needed so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
2. The provided code attempts to solve this problem but has some logical flaws:
   - The loop `for i in range(n)` is unnecessary and should be removed.
   - The condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` is checking if the best friend of the best friend of a friend is the friend themselves, which is not relevant to the problem.
   - The logic for determining the minimum number of invitations is incomplete and incorrect.
3. The code only checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and prints 2 if true. Otherwise, it prints 3. This is not a general solution to the problem.
4. The code does not handle cases where no pair of friends are each other's best friends and at least 2 friends need to be invited individually.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
