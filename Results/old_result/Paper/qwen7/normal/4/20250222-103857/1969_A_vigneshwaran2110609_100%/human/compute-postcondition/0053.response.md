Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `x`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The state before the loop starts is given as `i` is 21.

3. **Determine the initial state of `x`**: The state before the loop starts is given as `x` is an input integer.

4. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `x`. For the loop to execute, `x` must be greater than or equal to 0 (since `range(0, x)` will not generate any values if `x` is less than 0).

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since `i` is already set to 21, we do not need to change its value. However, we need to ensure that `x` is such that the loop can start executing. Therefore, `x` must be greater than or equal to 0.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` is 21.
- `x` must be greater than or equal to 0.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 21, `x` must be greater than or equal to 0**
