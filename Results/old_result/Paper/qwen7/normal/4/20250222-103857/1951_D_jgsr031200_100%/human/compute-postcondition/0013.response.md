Output State: **`costs` is a list containing at least one element; `curr` is `n // i`**

Explanation: The code `curr = n // i` assigns the integer division of `n` by `i` to the variable `curr`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `n` and `i`, `curr` is updated to the result of `n // i`. The list `costs` remains unchanged.
