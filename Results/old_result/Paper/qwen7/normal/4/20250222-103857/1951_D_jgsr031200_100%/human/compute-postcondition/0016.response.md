Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `costs` is a list containing at least one element.
- `h` is increased by `curr`.
- `curr` is `n // i`.
- `n` is decreased by `i * curr`.

### Loop Head:
```
for i in costs:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be an element of the `costs` list.

3. **Update the States**:
   - Since `i` is taken from the `costs` list, the list `costs` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.
   - The values of `h`, `curr`, and `n` do not change based on the loop head, so they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### Updated States:
- `costs` must still contain at least one element.
- `h` is increased by `curr`.
- `curr` is `n // i`.
- `n` is decreased by `i * curr`.

### Final State:
State: **`costs` must contain at least one element, `h` is increased by `curr`, `curr` is `n // i`, `n` is decreased by `i * curr`**
