Output State: **`h` is now `h + curr`, `n` is decreased by `i * curr`.**

Explanation: The code `n -= i * curr` updates the value of `n` by subtracting `i * curr` from its current value. The value of `h` is updated to `h + curr` as mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the updated values are `h` is now `h + curr` and `n` is decreased by `i * curr`.
