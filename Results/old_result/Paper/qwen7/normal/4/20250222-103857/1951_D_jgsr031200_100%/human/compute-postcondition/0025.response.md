Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `h` will be the sum of `curr` for each iteration, where `curr` is calculated as `n // i` for each `i` in `costs`. `n` will be reduced by `i * curr` for each iteration until `n` becomes less than the smallest value in `costs`.

In more detail, `h` will accumulate the quotient of `n` divided by each element in `costs`, and `n` will be successively reduced by the product of each element in `costs` and its corresponding quotient, until `n` is no longer sufficient to divide by any element in `costs`.
