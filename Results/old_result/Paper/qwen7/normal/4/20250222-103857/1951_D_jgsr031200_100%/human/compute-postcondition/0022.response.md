Output State: **`h` is `2 * h + curr`, `n` is decreased by the next `i * curr`, `curr` is `n // i`.**

Explanation: The initial state is `h` is `h + curr`, `n` is decreased by the next `i * curr`, `curr` is `n // i`. After executing `h += curr`, the value of `h` is updated to `h + curr`. Since `h` was initially `h + curr`, the new value of `h` becomes `2 * h + curr`. The values of `n` and `curr` remain unchanged from their initial state.
