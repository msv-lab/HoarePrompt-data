### Reasoning:

1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where \( n = k \). It prints "YES" and outputs 1 stall with a price of 1 coin, which ensures Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.

2. **Case Where \( n < k \):**
   - If \( n < k \), the function correctly prints "NO" and returns `None`. This is because Alice cannot buy even one jewel under these conditions, hence it is impossible for her to buy exactly \( k \) jewels.

3. **Case Where \( n \geq k \):**
   - For \( n \geq k \), the function constructs a solution by setting up two stalls with prices \( n - k + 1 \) and 1 coin respectively.
     - The first stall allows Alice to buy \( n - (n - k + 1) = k - 1 \) jewels.
     - The second stall allows Alice to buy 1 jewel.
     - Therefore, Alice will buy \( (k - 1) + 1 = k \) jewels in total.
   - The function checks if the sum of the quotients (number of jewels bought from each stall) is at least \( k \). Since the constructed solution always results in exactly \( k \) jewels being bought, this condition is always satisfied.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The function prints "YES", the number of stalls (which is 2 in this case), and the prices of the stalls. This matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for the given examples.
