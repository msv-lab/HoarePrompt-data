Based on the initial state provided:

- `h` is the sum of `curr` for each iteration, where `curr` is calculated as `n // i` for each `i` in `costs`.
- `n` is reduced by `i * curr` for each iteration until `n` becomes less than the smallest value in `costs`.
- The current value of `h` is less than `k`.

The print statement is `print('NO')`.

Given this information, the print statement will simply output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
