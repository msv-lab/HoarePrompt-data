### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Base Case Handling**: For the base case where `n == k`, the program correctly prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin, ensuring Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Case Where `n < k`**: The program correctly handles the case where `n < k` by printing "NO" since it's impossible for Alice to buy `k` jewels with fewer than `k` coins.

4. **General Case (`n >= k`)**: The program attempts to find a solution by setting up stalls with specific prices. However, the logic in `func_1` needs careful analysis:
   - It initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - It iterates over these costs, calculating how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and updating `n` accordingly.
   - It sums the number of jewels Alice can buy (`h`), which should be at least `k` for a valid solution.
   - If `h` is less than `k`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES", the number of stalls (`2`), and the prices of the stalls (`costs`).

5. **Stall Prices Calculation**: The prices `[n - k + 1, 1]` are chosen such that Alice buys the maximum number of jewels from the first stall and then 1 jewel from the second stall, ensuring the total number of jewels bought is exactly `k`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases like when `n` is just slightly greater than `k` and when `n` is much larger than `k` by correctly calculating the number of stalls and their prices.

### Conclusion:

The program logic is sound and correctly implements the required functionality based on the problem statement. It handles all specified cases and produces the correct output.

### Correctness:

**True**
