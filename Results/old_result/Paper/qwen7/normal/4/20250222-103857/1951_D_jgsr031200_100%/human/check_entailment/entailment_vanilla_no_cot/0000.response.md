Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Stalls**: The solution only considers up to 2 stalls, which is insufficient to cover all test cases. For example, in the third test case, `255 8`, the solution fails because it only considers two prices `[128, 64]` but does not explore other combinations that could allow Alice to buy exactly 8 jewels.

2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The function `func_1` does not properly distribute the coins across multiple stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The logic for determining the number of stalls and their respective prices is flawed and does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Incomplete Implementation**:
   - The code snippet provided includes commented-out sections (`import math as m`, `import collections as c`, and a generic binary search function `bs`) which are not used in the actual implementation. These should be removed or properly integrated into the solution.

### Correct Solution Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you would need to generate a sequence of prices for up to 60 stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One approach could involve generating a sequence of decreasing prices starting from `n` down to 1, ensuring that the sum of the number of jewels Alice can buy from these stalls equals `k`.

Here’s a revised version of the solution:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Initialize the number of stalls and prices
    stalls = []
    remaining_jewels = k
    current_price = n
    
    # Try to distribute the prices such that Alice buys exactly k jewels
    for i in range(1, 61):
        if remaining_jewels <= 0:
            break
        if current_price >= 1:
            num_jewels = min(remaining_jewels, n // current_price)
            remaining_jewels -= num_jewels
            stalls.append(current_price)
            current_price -= 1
        else:
            break
    
    if remaining_jewels > 0:
        print("NO")
    else:
        print("YES")
        print(len(stalls))
        print(' '.join(map(str, stalls)))
```

This solution iteratively tries to distribute the prices in a way that ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, considering up to 60 stalls.
