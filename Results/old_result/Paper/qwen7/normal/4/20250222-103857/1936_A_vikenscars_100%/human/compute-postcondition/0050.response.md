Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the condition `range(n)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

2. **Determine the current state after the previous iteration**:
   - `max_item_idx` is 3.
   - `pair_idx` is 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans1` is the return value of `func_1(3, 0, 3, 1)`.

3. **Evaluate the conditions based on `ans1`**:
   - If `ans1` equals '<', then `max_item_idx` remains 3 and `pair_idx` remains 1.
   - If `ans1` equals '=', then `ans2` is the return value of `func_1(0, 0, 1, 1)`.
     - If `ans2` equals '>', then `max_item_idx` becomes 3 and `pair_idx` becomes 1.
     - Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` is not specified in the postcondition, so we assume it remains the same as the initial value or the value from the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` will depend on the value of `ans1`.
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `ans2` is only relevant if `ans1` equals '=', but since we don't know the value of `ans1`, we cannot determine `ans2` yet.

Given the information, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. However, since `n` is not specified to change, we focus on `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`max_item_idx` is 3, `pair_idx` is 1, `i` is 2, `ans1` is the return value of `func_1(3, 0, 3, 1)`, `ans2` is undefined**.
