### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can query the relative values of \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\) using up to \(3n\) queries.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - `func_1(a, b, c, d)` is used to make a query and return the result.
   - `func_2(n)` is the main function that aims to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) with the maximum XOR.

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - **Finding the Maximum OR Value:**
     - The code attempts to find the index `max_item_idx` with the highest OR value (`(p_a \mid p_b)`).
     - It iterates through indices from 1 to \(n-1\) and compares the OR values with the current `max_item_idx`.
     - This part seems correct as it finds the index with the highest OR value.

   - **Finding the Pair with Maximum XOR:**
     - After finding `max_item_idx`, it tries to find another index `pair_idx` such that \(p_{max_item_idx} \oplus p_{pair_idx}\) is maximized.
     - It compares \((p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_{pair_idx})\) with \((p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_i)\) for all \(i\).
     - If \((p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_{pair_idx}) < (p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_i)\), it updates `pair_idx` to `i`.
     - If \((p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_{pair_idx}) = (p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_i)\), it further checks \((p_{pair_idx} \mid p_i)\) to ensure the XOR is maximized.
     - This logic is flawed because it only considers the OR value and not the actual XOR value directly.

4. **Flaw in Logic:**
   - The code does not directly maximize the XOR value but rather the OR value.
   - The XOR value is not directly compared, and the logic might not always find the correct pair with the maximum XOR.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - A more effective approach would involve directly comparing XOR values or using a different strategy to find the maximum XOR.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the logic to find the indices with the maximum XOR value. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
