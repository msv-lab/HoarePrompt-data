Output State: **max_item_idx is 3, n is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `max_item_idx` will be the last index that satisfied the condition `ans == '<'`. Given the conditions provided for the first three iterations, and assuming the loop continues to increment `max_item_idx` until it reaches the value of `n-1` (since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`), the final value of `max_item_idx` would be `n-1`. However, based on the information given, we only know for sure that `max_item_idx` was updated to 3 after the third iteration. Without further information about the behavior of `func_1` for indices greater than 3, we can only conclude that `max_item_idx` is 3. The value of `n` remains greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, as no information suggests otherwise.
