Output State: **`max_item_idx` is 3, `pair_idx` is 2, `i` is 2, `ans1` is the return value of `func_1(3, 1, 3, 2)`, `ans2` is the return value of `func_1(1, 1, 2, 2)`**

Explanation: The code `pair_idx = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 2) to `pair_idx`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
