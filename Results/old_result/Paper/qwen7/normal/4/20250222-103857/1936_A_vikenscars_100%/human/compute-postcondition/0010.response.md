Output State: **`max_item_idx` is 1, `n` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 2, `ans` is the return value of `func_1(1, 1, 2, 2)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` to be the return value of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`. Given the initial state, `max_item_idx` is 1, `i` is 2, and `ans` was previously the return value of `func_1(0, 0, 1, 1)`. After executing the code, `ans` is now the return value of `func_1(1, 1, 2, 2)`. The other variables (`max_item_idx`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
