Output State: **`max_item_idx` is 3, `pair_idx` is 2, `i` is 2, `ans1` is the return value of `func_1(3, 1, 3, 2)`**

Explanation: The code `pair_idx = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `pair_idx`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `max_item_idx` remains 3, `pair_idx` changes to 2, `i` stays as 2, and `ans1` retains its value as the return value of `func_1(3, 1, 3, 2)`.
