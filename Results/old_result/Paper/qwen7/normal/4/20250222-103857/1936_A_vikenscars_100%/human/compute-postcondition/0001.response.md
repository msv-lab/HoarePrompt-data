State: **`max_item_idx` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1** 

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine Initial Values for `i`**: The loop starts with `i` initialized to 1, as specified by `range(1, n)`.
3. **Determine Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because the range function `range(1, n)` will not generate any values if `n` is 1 or less.
4. **Adjust Other States**: The initial value of `max_item_idx` (which is 0) does not affect the loop's ability to execute based on the given range condition. Therefore, it does not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the only adjustments needed are to ensure `n` is within the specified range and `i` is set to 1.
