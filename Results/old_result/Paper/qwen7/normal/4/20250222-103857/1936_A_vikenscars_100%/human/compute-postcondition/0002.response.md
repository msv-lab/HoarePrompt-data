Output State: **`max_item_idx` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1, `ans` is the return value of `func_1(0, 0, 1, 1)`**.

This means that the function `func_1` was called with the arguments `max_item_idx`, `max_item_idx`, `i`, and `i`, which are all 0 and 1 respectively. The return value of this function call is stored in the variable `ans`. The values of `max_item_idx` and `i` remain unchanged, and `n` also remains within its original range.
