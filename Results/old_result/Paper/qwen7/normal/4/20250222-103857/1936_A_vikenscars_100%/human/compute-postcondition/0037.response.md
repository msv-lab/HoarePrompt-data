Postcondition: `max_item_idx` is 3, `pair_idx` is 0, `i` is 0, `ans1` is the return value of `func_1(3, 3, 3, 0)`. If `ans1` is '<', then `ans1` remains '<'. Otherwise, if `ans1` is '=', then `ans2` is the return value of `func_1(3, 3, 0, 0)`, and if `ans1` was '>' initially, `ans2` remains unchanged.
