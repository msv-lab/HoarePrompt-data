Output State: **`max_item_idx` is 3, `pair_idx` is 0, `i` is 0, `ans1` is the return value of `func_1(3, 3, 3, 0)`, `ans1` is not equal to '<' and is equal to '=', `ans2` is the return value of `func_1(3, 3, 0, 0)`, and the current value of `ans2` is '>'**

Explanation: The line `pair_idx = i` updates the value of `pair_idx` to be the same as `i`. Since `i` is initially 0, `pair_idx` is now also 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
