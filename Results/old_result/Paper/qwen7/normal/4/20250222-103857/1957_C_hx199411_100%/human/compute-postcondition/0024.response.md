Output State: `t` is `t - 2 * k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer that can be calculated as `num + 2 * (k - 1)`, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are input integers.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `t` decreases by 2 for each iteration, so it will decrease by `2 * k` in total. The variable `num` increases by 1 if `c` equals `r` and by 2 if `c` does not equal `r`. Since the loop runs `k` times, `num` will increase by either 1 or 2 for each iteration, resulting in a final value of `num + 2 * (k - 1)`. The variable `i` will be set to `k - 1` after the last iteration. The variables `c` and `r` will hold the values from the last input provided during the loop's execution.
