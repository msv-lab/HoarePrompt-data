Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and `c` is not equal to `r`; `num` is 2.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is incremented by 2, starting from its initial value of 0. Therefore, `num` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
