Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `num` is `num + 2`, `i` is `k`, `c` and `r` are integers from the input, `m` is `n - num`, `c` and `r` are assigned values from the input.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is incremented by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The updated value of `num` is expressed as `num + 2`.
