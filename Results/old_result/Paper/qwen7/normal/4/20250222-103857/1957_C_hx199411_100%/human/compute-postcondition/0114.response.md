Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `c` is an input integer from the second input, `r` is an input integer from the second input, and if `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 2; otherwise, `num` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `c` and `r`. The initial value of `c` being equal to `r` (making `num` 1) is no longer relevant since the new values of `c` and `r` are used. Therefore, `num` is now 2 regardless of whether `c` equals `r` or not. All other variables remain unchanged.
