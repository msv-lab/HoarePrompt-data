### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard with alternating moves between the player and the computer.
   - The player starts first, and the computer mirrors the player's moves unless the move is along the diagonal (i.e., \( r = c \)), in which case the computer skips its turn.
   - We need to calculate the number of different final configurations possible after \( k \) moves, considering the constraints and the modulo operation.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), and the coordinates of the \( k \) moves.
   - It calculates `num` which counts how many moves were along the diagonal (where the computer cannot mirror).
   - It then calculates `m` as \( n - \text{num} \), which represents the number of non-diagonal positions left to place rooks.
   - The code uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions, ensuring no two rooks attack each other.

3. **Dynamic Programming Explanation:**
   - The dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized to store the number of ways to place rooks in up to `m` positions.
   - Base cases are set for `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`.
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` ensures that the number of ways to place rooks in `i` positions is calculated correctly, considering the constraints of no attacking rooks.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `m` is 0 or 1, the code handles these edge cases correctly by printing 1.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required bounds.

5. **Verification:**
   - The code logic aligns with the problem statement and the example provided.
   - The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for calculating the number of valid configurations.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the logic for calculating `num`.

### Detailed Analysis of the Flaw:

- The variable `num` is intended to count the number of diagonal moves (where the computer cannot mirror). This is crucial because the number of non-diagonal moves determines the number of positions left to place rooks.
- In the current implementation, `num` is incremented by 1 when `c == r` and by 2 otherwise. This logic is incorrect because it should only increment `num` by 1 when `c == r` and by 0 when `c != r`.

### Corrected Logic:

- The correct logic should be:
  ```python
  if c == r:
      num += 1
  ```

- The corrected code should look like this:
  ```python
  def func():
      t = int(input())
      while t:
          t -= 1
          (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
          num = 0
          for i in range(k):
              (c, r) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
              if c == r:
                  num += 1
          m = n - num
          if m == 0:
              print(1)
          elif m == 1:
              print(1)
          else:
              dp = [0 for i in range(m + 1)]
              dp[1] = 1
              dp[2] = 3
              for i in range(3, m + 1):
                  dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
              print(dp[m])
  ```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment overlooked the incorrect logic for counting `num`. The corrected logic ensures that `num` accurately reflects the number of diagonal moves, which is essential for calculating the number of non-diagonal positions left to place rooks.
