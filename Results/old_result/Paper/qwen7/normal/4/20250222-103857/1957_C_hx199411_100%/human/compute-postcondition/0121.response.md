Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer from the second input, `r` is an integer from the second input, and `num` is either 4 or 5 depending on whether `c` equals `r` or not.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is incremented by 1. Initially, `num` is either 3 or 4. After incrementing, `num` will be either 4 or 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
