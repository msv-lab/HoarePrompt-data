Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is defined as `n - num`.
- `t` is defined as `t - 1`.
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `k` is the second input integer.
- `num` is the total sum of 1 added when `c` equals `r` and 2 added when `c` does not equal `r` for all iterations.
- `i` is defined as `k + (k - 1)`.
- `c` and `r` are integers from the input.
- `i` is greater than `k`.

The print statement is simply `print(1)`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
