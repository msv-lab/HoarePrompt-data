Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either `num + 2` or 5 or 7 depending on whether `c` is equal to `r` or not, `i` is 3, `c` and `r` are input integers, `c` and `r` are assigned the values from the input split by space.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state mentions that `num` is either `num + 1`, 4, or 6 depending on whether `c` is equal to `r` or not, after incrementing `num` by 1, `num` will now be either `num + 2`, 5, or 7 depending on the same condition. All other variables remain unchanged.
