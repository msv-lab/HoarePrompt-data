Output State: **`dp[i + 1]` is calculated as `(dp[i] + i * dp[i - 1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), `i` is `i + 1, `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), `m` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. This means that the value of `dp[i + 1]` from the initial state is now defined based on the updated `dp[i]`. The variable `i` is also incremented by 1. The condition that `m` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1` remains unchanged.
