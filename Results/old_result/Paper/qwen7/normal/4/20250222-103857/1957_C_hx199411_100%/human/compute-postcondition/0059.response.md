Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `num` is 1, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are integers from the input, `m` is `n - num`, `i` is less than `k`, and `c` equals `r`.**

Explanation: The code `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Initially, `num` is 0, so after executing the code, `num` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
