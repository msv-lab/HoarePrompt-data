Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is updated to `t - 2 * k`
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `num` is either `k` or `2 * k`
- `i` is `k - 1`
- `c` and `r` are input integers
- `m` is calculated as `n - num`, and it is explicitly stated that `m` is equal to 1.

The print statement is simply `print(1)`. Since no other variables are being printed and the statement directly prints the integer `1`, the output will be:

Output: **1**
