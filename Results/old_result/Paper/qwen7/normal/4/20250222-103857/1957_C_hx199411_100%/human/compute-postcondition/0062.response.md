Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `num` is `num + 2`, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are integers from the input, `m` is `n - num`, `i` is less than `k`, and `c` is not equal to `r`**

Explanation: The variable `num` is incremented by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
