Output State: **`t` is `t - 2 * k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either `k` or `2 * k`, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are input integers, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, and `m` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `i`, `c`, `r`, and `m` remain unchanged, and `dp` is now a list of zeros with a length of `m + 1`.
