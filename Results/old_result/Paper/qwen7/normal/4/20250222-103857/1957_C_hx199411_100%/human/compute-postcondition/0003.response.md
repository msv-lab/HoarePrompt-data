Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The initial state had `t` as `t - 1`. After executing the code, `t` is decremented by 1 again, making it `t - 2`. The code then takes two integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. Therefore, `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the integers input by the user.
