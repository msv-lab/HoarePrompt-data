Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `range(k)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the current state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < k`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged from the previous iteration unless specified otherwise.

5. **Consider the postconditions and other variables**:
   - `t` is updated by subtracting 2 each time the loop runs.
   - `n` is an input integer and does not change within the loop.
   - `k` is an input integer and does not change within the loop.
   - `num` is updated based on conditions involving `c` and `r`, but this does not affect the loop continuation.
   - `i` starts at 1 and needs to be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.
   - `c` and `r` are input integers and do not change within the loop.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i`.

**State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either `num + 1` or 4 or 6 depending on whether `c` is equal to `r` or not, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are input integers**
