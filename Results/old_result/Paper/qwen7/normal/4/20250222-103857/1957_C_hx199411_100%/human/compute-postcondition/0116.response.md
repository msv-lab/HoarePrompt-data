Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `c` is an input integer from the second input, `r` is an input integer from the second input, `num` is 4**.

Explanation: The initial value of `num` is 2 (since `c` is equal to `r` or not, both cases make `num` initially 2). After executing `num += 2`, `num` is incremented by 2, resulting in `num` being 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
