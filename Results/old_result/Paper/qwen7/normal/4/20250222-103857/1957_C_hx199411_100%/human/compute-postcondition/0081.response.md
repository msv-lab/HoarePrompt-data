Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is 0.
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `k` is the second input integer.
- `num` is the total sum of 1 added when `c` equals `r` and 2 added when `c` does not equal `r` for all iterations.
- `i` is `k + (k - 1)`, which simplifies to `2k - 1`.
- `c` and `r` are integers from the input.
- `i` is greater than `k`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(1)
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the integer `1`. Since no other variables or their values are involved in this specific line of code, the output is straightforward.

Output: **1**
