Output State: **`dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1]` set to 1, `m` is `n - num`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `num` is the total sum of 1 added when `c` equals `r` and 2 added when `c` does not equal `r` for all iterations, `i` is `k + (k - 1)`, `c` and `r` are integers from the input, and `i` is greater than `k`, `m` is not equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code sets `dp[1]` to 1, which changes the value of the first element in the list `dp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
