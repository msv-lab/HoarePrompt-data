Based on the initial state provided, the `dp` list is constructed according to the given formula for indices from 3 to `m + 1`. The initial conditions are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.

The `print(dp[m])` statement will print the value of `dp[m]`, which is one of the elements in the `dp` list. Since the exact value of `m` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `dp[m]`. However, we know it is computed based on the recurrence relation provided.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the m-th element in the list dp, computed based on the given recurrence relation)**
