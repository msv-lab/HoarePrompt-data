Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `num` is either `num + 1` (if `c` equals `r`) or `num + 2` (if `c` does not equal `r`), `i` is `k + 1`, `c` and `r` are integers from the input, `m` is `n - num`, `c` and `r` are assigned values from the input, `c` and `r` are now integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `c` and `r`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `i`, or `m`. The values of `c` and `r` are updated to the integers read from the input.
