Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is 0, `i` is 0, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input separated by a space and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new variables `c` and `r` are assigned the values of the input integers.
