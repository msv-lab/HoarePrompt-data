Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n), and for each test case, pairs of integers r_i and c_i (1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n). The function returns different outputs based on the conditions provided, including error messages for invalid inputs and results based on the given constraints.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing specific integers, and returns appropriate outputs based on the given constraints and conditions without accepting any parameters directly.
