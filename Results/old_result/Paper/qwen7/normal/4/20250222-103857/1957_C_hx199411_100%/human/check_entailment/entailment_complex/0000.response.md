Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the board `n` and the number of moves `k`.
3. It then reads `k` pairs of coordinates `(r, c)` and calculates `num`, which counts how many times `c` equals `r` (adding 1) versus when `c` does not equal `r` (adding 2).
4. The variable `m` is set to `n - num`, which represents the number of remaining cells that can still be used to place rooks.
5. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining cells, ensuring no two rooks attack each other.
6. The base cases for the dynamic programming array `dp` are correctly initialized.
7. The recurrence relation used in the dynamic programming calculation is correct, ensuring that the number of configurations is computed accurately.
8. The final result is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the above points, the logic and implementation of the program align with the problem statement and the provided example. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
