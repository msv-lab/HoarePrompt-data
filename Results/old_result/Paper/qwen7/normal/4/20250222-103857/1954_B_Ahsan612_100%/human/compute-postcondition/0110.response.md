Output State: **`i` is 5, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` (which was infinity) and `same` (which is 1), the number of iterations left is 0, `n` is an input integer, `same` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `ar[i]` equals `num`, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 4, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 5. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
