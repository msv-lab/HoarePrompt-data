Output State: **`i` is 5, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` (which was infinity) and `same` (which is 1), `num` is equal to `ar[i]`, the number of iterations left is 0, `same` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `ar[i]` equals `num`, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ar[i]` to `num`. Since `i` is 5, `num` now holds the value of `ar[5]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
