Postcondition: **The number of iterations left is the new list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `n` is the length of this list minus 1, `same` indicates whether the first element `num` appears consecutively, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list starting from index 1, `i` is the next index to check in the list, and either `same` is 2 indicating that `num` has been found consecutively, or `same` is 1 and `minn` is 1 with `i` being 3 and the element at index `i` in `ar` is not equal to `num`.**
