Output State: **`same` is 1, `minn` is 1, `num` is the element at index 2 in `ar`, `i` is 3, and `i` is less than or equal to `n` and the element at index `i` in `ar` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum of its current value (`minn`) and the value of `same`. Given that `same` is initially 1, and assuming `minn` was also initialized to a value greater than or equal to 1 (since it's initially set to infinity), `minn` remains 1 after this operation. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
