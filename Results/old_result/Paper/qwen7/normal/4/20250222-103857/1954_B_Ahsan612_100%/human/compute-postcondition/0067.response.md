Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, the element at index `i` in `ar` is now equal to `num`, and `i` must be less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value at the current index `i` of the list `ar` to the variable `num`. Since the initial state specifies that the element at index `i` in `ar` is not equal to `num`, after executing the line `num = ar[i]`, the element at index `i` in `ar` is now equal to `num`. The other conditions (`i` is incremented by 1 and `i` must be less than `n`) remain unchanged.
