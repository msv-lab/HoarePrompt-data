The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 4, so after the increment, `i` becomes 5. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `minn` is the minimum of `minn` (which was infinity) and `same` (which is 1); the number of iterations left is 0; `n` is an input integer; `same` is 2; `i` is now 5; `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user; `num` is equal to `ar[0]`; `ar[i]` is equal to `num` if `ar[i]` equals `num`, otherwise `i` is 5, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 1, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`, the number of iterations left is 0, `same` is 1, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.

Output State: **`minn` is the minimum of `minn` (which was infinity) and `same` (which is 1); the number of iterations left is 0; `n` is an input integer; `same` is 2; `i` is now 5; `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user; `num` is equal to `ar[0]`; `ar[i]` is equal to `num` if `ar[i]` equals `num`, otherwise `i` is 5, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 1, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`, the number of iterations left is 0, `same` is 1, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**
