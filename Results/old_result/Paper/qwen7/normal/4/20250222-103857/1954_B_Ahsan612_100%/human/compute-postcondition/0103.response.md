Output State: **`minn` is the minimum of `minn` (which was infinity) and `same` (which is 1), the number of iterations left is 0, `n` is an input integer, `same` is 1, `i` is 2, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, `num` is equal to `ar[0]`, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum of its current value (`minn`, which was infinity) and `same` (which is 1). Since infinity is greater than 1, `minn` will now be 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
