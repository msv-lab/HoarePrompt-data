Reasoning:
The provided function attempts to find the minimum number of elements to remove from the array to make it non-beautiful. The logic in the function is flawed, however. Specifically, the function does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition of the array. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Minimum Removals**: The function iterates through the array to find the length of the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements (`same`). It then sets `minn` to the minimum of these lengths. However, the goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove, not just the length of the longest sequence. The function should aim to break the beauty condition by removing the least number of elements, which might not necessarily be the length of the longest sequence.

2. **Handling of Test Cases**: The function does not handle the case where the array is already non-beautiful. For example, if the array alternates between two different numbers, it incorrectly identifies the length of the longest sequence as the answer, which is not always the optimal solution.

3. **Output Logic**: The function checks if `minn` is infinity or equal to the length of the array and prints `-1` in those cases. This logic is not sufficient to determine the correct minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the provided function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
