Output State: **`minn` is infinity, the number of iterations left is 0, `n` is an input integer, `same` is 2, `i` is 2, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, `num` is equal to `ar[0]`, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The variable `same` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state.
