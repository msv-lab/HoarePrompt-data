Output State: **`minn` is 2, the number of iterations left is 0, `n` is an input integer, `same` is 2, `i` is 7, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum between its current value (1) and the value of `same` (2). Since 2 is not less than 1, `minn` remains 1. However, the problem statement mentions the initial value of `minn` as 1, and after executing the line `minn = min(minn, same)`, `minn` is updated to 2 because it is the minimum between 1 and 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
