Postcondition: **`minn` is the minimum value between `minn` and 1, `same` is 1, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, `num` is equal to the last element checked before the loop ends. If `minn` is infinity or `minn` is equal to the length of `ar`, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition `(minn == inf or minn == len(ar))` is false.**
