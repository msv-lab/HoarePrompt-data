Output State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum value between `num` and `ar[i]` if `ar[i]` equals `num`; otherwise, `minn` remains infinity.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was set to 3, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
