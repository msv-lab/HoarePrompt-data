Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`.
2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1, and the element at index `i` in `ar` is not equal to `num`. Additionally, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given these conditions, for the loop to execute one more time, the following must be true:
- `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

Since `i` has already been incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`. For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must be less than `len(ar)`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i + 1` is less than `len(ar)`.

**State:**
- `i` is incremented by 1 (so `i + 1` is the new value of `i`)
- `i + 1` must be less than `len(ar)`

So, the final state is:
State: **`i + 1` is less than `len(ar)`**
