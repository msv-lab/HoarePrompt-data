Output State: **`same` is either 4 or 2; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is either 4 or 5; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 5; `num` is either the first element of the list `ar` or `ar[4]`; `minn` is the minimum value between `num` and `ar[i]` if `ar[i]` equals `num`; otherwise, `minn` remains `same` if `same` is 4, or remains 2 if `same` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `same` is incremented by 1. Since `same` was either 3 or 1, adding 1 to it results in `same` being either 4 or 2. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
