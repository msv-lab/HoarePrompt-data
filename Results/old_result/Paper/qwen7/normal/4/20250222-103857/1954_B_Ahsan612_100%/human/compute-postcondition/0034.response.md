Output State: **`same` is 1; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is either 5 or 6; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 5; `num` is now `ar[i]`; `minn` is the minimum value between `num` and 1.**

Explanation: The line `same = 1` changes the value of `same` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
