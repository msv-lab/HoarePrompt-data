Output State: The number of iterations left is 0, `n` is the length of the list `ar` minus 1, `same` indicates the maximum consecutive occurrences of `num` in the list, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list starting from index 1, `i` is equal to `n + 1`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, there are no more elements left to check (`i` would be equal to or greater than the length of the list), so the number of iterations left is 0. The variable `same` will hold the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `num` found during the loop's execution. `minn` will be the minimum value encountered in the list starting from the second element (index 1). The variable `i` will be set to `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of the list.
