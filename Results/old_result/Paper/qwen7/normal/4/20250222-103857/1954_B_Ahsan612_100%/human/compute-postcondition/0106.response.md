Postcondition: `minn` is the minimum of `minn` (which was infinity) and `same` (which is 1), the number of iterations left is 0, `n` is an input integer, `same` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `ar[i]` equals `num`, `i` is 2, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, `num` is equal to `ar[0]`, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.
