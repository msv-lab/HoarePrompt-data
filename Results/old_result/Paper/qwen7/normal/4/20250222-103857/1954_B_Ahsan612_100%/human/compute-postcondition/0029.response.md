Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `same` is either 3 or 1.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is either 4 or 5.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `num` is either the first element of the list `ar` or `ar[4]`.
- `minn` is the minimum value between `num` and `ar[i]` if `ar[i]` equals `num`; otherwise, `minn` remains `same` if `same` is 3, or remains 2 if `same` is 1.

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `while i < len(ar)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.
3. **Current Values of `i`**:
   - `i` is either 4 or 5.
   - If `i` is 4, then `i + 1 = 5` and `5 < len(ar)` implies `len(ar) > 5`.
   - If `i` is 5, then `i + 1 = 6` and `6 < len(ar)` implies `len(ar) > 6`.

Since `i` must be less than `len(ar)` for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than the current value of `i + 1`.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` is either 4 or 5.
- To ensure the loop continues, `len(ar)` must be greater than 5 (since `i` is either 4 or 5).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

**State:**
- `same` is either 3 or 1.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is either 4 or 5.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 5.
- `num` is either the first element of the list `ar` or `ar[4]`.
- `minn` is the minimum value between `num` and `ar[i]` if `ar[i]` equals `num`; otherwise, `minn` remains `same` if `same` is 3, or remains 2 if `same` is 1.

State: **`same` is either 3 or 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is either 4 or 5, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 5, `num` is either the first element of the list `ar` or `ar[4]`, and `minn` is the minimum value between `num` and `ar[i]` if `ar[i]` equals `num`; otherwise, `minn` remains `same` if `same` is 3, or remains 2 if `same` is 1.**
