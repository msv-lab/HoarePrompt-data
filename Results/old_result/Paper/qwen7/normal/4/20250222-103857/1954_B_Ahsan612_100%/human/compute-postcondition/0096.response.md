Output State: **`minn` is infinity, the number of iterations left is 0, `n` is an input integer, `same` is 1, `i` is 1, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, `num` is equal to `ar[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `i = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `i`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
