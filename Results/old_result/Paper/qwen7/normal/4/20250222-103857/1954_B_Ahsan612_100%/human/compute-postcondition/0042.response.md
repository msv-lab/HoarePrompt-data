Based on the initial state provided:

- `same` is a non-negative integer.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, where `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `num` is the last element of the list `ar` (or the first element if no other elements match `num`).
- `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and the current `same` value. The current value of `minn` is either infinity or equal to the length of the list `ar`.

The print statement is simply `print(-1)`, which means it will print the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
