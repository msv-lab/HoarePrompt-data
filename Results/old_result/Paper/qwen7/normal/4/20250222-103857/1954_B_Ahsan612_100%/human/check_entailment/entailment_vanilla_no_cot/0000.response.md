Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Logic for Finding Minimum Length of Consecutive Same Elements**: The logic to find the minimum length of consecutive same elements is flawed. It does not correctly handle the requirement to find the smallest segment that, when removed, would make the array non-beautiful.

2. **Misunderstanding the Problem**: The program attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same and removes them, which is not the correct approach. Instead, the program should identify the smallest segment where removing any element would break the "beautiful" property.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not correctly handle edge cases where the array is already non-beautiful or where the removal of any single element can break the "beautiful" property.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify segments where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing a single element. Specifically, we need to look for segments where the middle element can be removed to break the "beautiful" property.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the longest segment where the array is beautiful
        max_beautiful_segment = 0
        current_length = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n-1):
            if ar[i-1] == ar[i+1]:
                current_length += 1
            else:
                max_beautiful_segment = max(max_beautiful_segment, current_length)
                current_length = 1
        
        # Update the last segment
        max_beautiful_segment = max(max_beautiful_segment, current_length)
        
        # If the entire array is beautiful, we need to remove at least one element
        if max_beautiful_segment == n:
            print(n - 1)
        else:
            print(-1)

func()
```

This solution correctly identifies the longest segment where the array is beautiful and then determines if removing any element from this segment would make the array non-beautiful.
