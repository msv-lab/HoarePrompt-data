Output State: **`rem` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is `a[0]`, `y` is `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block. All the initial conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
