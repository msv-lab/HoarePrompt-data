Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `r` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `rem` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `rem = 0` initializes the variable `rem` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
