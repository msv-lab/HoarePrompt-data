Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `r` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0.**

The code `y = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
