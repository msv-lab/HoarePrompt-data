Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Descriptions:**
   - `i = n - 1`: This means `i` is the last index of the list `a`.
   - `n` remains as the initial value provided.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `k` is either 0 or has been reduced according to the loop conditions.
   - `r` is set to `a[n-1]` if the loop did not break before reaching the last iteration.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is calculated as `n - (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `n - (n - 1 + 1) = 0`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The expression to be evaluated is `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y`.
   - Substitute the known values:
     - `r` is `a[n-1]`.
     - `rem` is 0.
     - `y` is 0.
   - The expression becomes: `(a[n-1] - 1) * n + 1 + 0 + 0`.

3. **Final Expression Simplification:**
   - Since `y` is 0, it does not contribute to the final value.
   - The expression simplifies to: `(a[n-1] - 1) * n + 1`.

Given this, the print statement will output the value of `(a[n-1] - 1) * n + 1`.

Output: **(a[n-1] - 1) * n + 1**
