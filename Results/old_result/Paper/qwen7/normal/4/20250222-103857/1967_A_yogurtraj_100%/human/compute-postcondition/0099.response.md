Output State: **`rem` is 0, `ii` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `a`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop, and the overall postcondition covers both cases where `k` is not 0 and where `k` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `rem = 0` sets the variable `rem` to 0. The values of `ii` are incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integer inputs received from the user. The lists `a` and the conditions around `k` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop. The overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition since no changes are made to `a`, `n`, and `k` outside the specified conditions.
