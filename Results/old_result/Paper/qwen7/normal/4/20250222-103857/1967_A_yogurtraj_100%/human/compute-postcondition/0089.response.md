Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `i = n - 2`: This means `i` is the second-to-last index of the list `a`.
   - `k` is either reduced to 0 or left with a non-negative value that cannot be further reduced by the loop.
   - `r = a[n - 1] + k // n`: Here, `r` is the sum of the last element of the list `a` and the integer division of `k` by `n`.
   - `rem = 0`: This is a variable that is not used in the print statement.
   - `y = 0`: This is another variable that is not used in the print statement.
   - `ii` is the number of iterations performed, but it is not relevant to the print statement.
   - `a`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop, and the current value of `k` is not 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`.

Given these details, let's substitute the known values into the expression:

- `r = a[n - 1] + k // n`: Since `k` is not 0 and cannot be further reduced, `k // n` will be the integer part of `k` divided by `n`.
- Let's denote `k // n` as `q` (the quotient), so `r = a[n - 1] + q`.

Now, substituting `r` into the print statement:

- `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`
- Substitute `r` with `a[n - 1] + q`: \((a[n - 1] + q - 1) * n + 1 + k % n\).

Since `k` is not 0, `k % n` will be the remainder when `k` is divided by `n`.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

- \((a[n - 1] + q - 1) * n + 1 + r % n\).

Given that `r = a[n - 1] + q`, the expression becomes:

- \((a[n - 1] + q - 1) * n + 1 + (a[n - 1] + q) % n\).

This can be further simplified to:

- \((a[n - 1] + q - 1) * n + 1 + (a[n - 1] + q - n * (a[n - 1] + q // n))\).

Since `q = k // n`, the expression simplifies to:

- \((a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1 + (a[n - 1] + k // n) % n\).

Given that `r = a[n - 1] + k // n`, the final expression is:

- \((r - 1) * n + 1 + r % n\).

Since `r` is an integer, `r % n` will be the remainder when `r` is divided by `n`.

Thus, the print statement will output:

Output: **(r - 1) * n + 1 + r % n (where r is a[n - 1] + k // n)**
