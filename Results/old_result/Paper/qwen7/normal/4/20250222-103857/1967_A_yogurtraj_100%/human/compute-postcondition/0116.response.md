Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Determine the current state**:
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - The value of `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` if `i` is 0, otherwise `r` is `a[0]` and `y` is `n - 2`.

4. **Analyze the loop body**:
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we need to infer what happens based on the loop condition and the given postconditions.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - If `i` is currently 0, then after the loop, `i` will become 1.
   - If `i` is currently 1, then the loop will terminate because `i < n - 1` will no longer be true.

6. **Update the states**:
   - If `i` is 0, after the loop, `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `rem` remains 0.
   - `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, which means it is reduced by `(1 + 1) * (a[1] - a[0]) = 2 * (a[1] - a[0])`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- If `i` is 0, after the loop, `i` becomes 1.
- If `i` is 1, the loop terminates.

Since we need to consider both cases, we will provide the state for the case where `i` is 0, as this is the next possible state for the loop to continue.

**State:**
- `rem` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `k` is reduced by `2 * (a[1] - a[0])`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`rem` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is reduced by `2 * (a[1] - a[0])`**.
