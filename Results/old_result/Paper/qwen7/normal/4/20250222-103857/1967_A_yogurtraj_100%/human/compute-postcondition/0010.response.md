Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `r` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The code calculates `rem` as the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`. Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` is 1, and any number modulo 1 is 0. Therefore, `rem` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
