Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is sorted, `n` is an input integer, `k` is either 0 or has been reduced according to the loop conditions, `r` is equal to `a[0]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` and `k` are integers taken as input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
        r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
        rem = k % (i + 1)
        y = n - 1 - i
        k = 0
        break
    else:
        k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
        r = a[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is reduced by ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is false, otherwise `i` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `r` is `a[i] + 0 // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `0 % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is adjusted based on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. If the condition is true, `k` becomes 0, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i`. If the condition is false, `k` is reduced by `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]))`, `r` is `a[i + 1]`, `rem` is `0 % (i + 2)`, and `y` is `n - 2 - i`. The most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is reduced by `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]))` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `k` is 0, `r` is either `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` or `a[i + 1]`, `rem` is either `k % (i + 1)` or 0, `y` is either `n - 1 - i` or `n - 2 - i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
