Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is decreased by the value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `k` by subtracting the product of `(i + 1)` and the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` from the current value of `k`. Since `i` is 3, the expression `(i + 1)` evaluates to 4. However, the values of `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` are not specified, so the exact new value of `k` cannot be determined. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 3 remains unchanged.
