Output State: **`i` is `a[n-1]`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is either 0 or has been reduced according to the loop conditions, `r` is set to `a[n-1] + k // n` if `k != 0`, otherwise `r` is set to `a[n-1]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` and `k` are integers taken as input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers. This list is assigned to the variable `a`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `r`, `rem`, `y`, `ii`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
