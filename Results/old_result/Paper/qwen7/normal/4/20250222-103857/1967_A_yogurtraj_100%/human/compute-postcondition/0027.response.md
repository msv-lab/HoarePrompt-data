Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is updated based on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`. If the condition is true, `k` becomes 0, `r` is set to `a[2]`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is set to `n - 3`. Otherwise, `k` is updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its original value, and `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`.
