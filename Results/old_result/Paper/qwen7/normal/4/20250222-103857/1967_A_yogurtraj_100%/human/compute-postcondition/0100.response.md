Output State: **`rem` is 0, `ii` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `y` is 0.**

The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `y`. Since `rem`, `ii`, `n`, and `k` were not affected by this assignment, their states remain unchanged. The only new information is that `y` is now 0.
