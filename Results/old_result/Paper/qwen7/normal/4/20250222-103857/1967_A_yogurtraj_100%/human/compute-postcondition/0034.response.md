Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 4, `r` is `a[3] + 0 // 4`, `rem` is `0 % 4`, `y` is `n - 2`, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the loop or the most internal if statement. Since no variables are updated or assigned new values within the given code snippet, the values of `i`, `n`, `r`, `rem`, `y`, and `k` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 4 also remains valid.
