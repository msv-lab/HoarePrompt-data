Output State: **`rem` is either `k % (n - 1)` or 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is `n - (n - 1) = 0`, `k` is either 0 or fully reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all iterations, `r` is either `a[n - 2] + k // (n - 1)` or `a[n - 1]` if the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is met for some `i`, and `y` is 0.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n - 2`. The variable `n` will be reduced to `0` since it decreases by `1` with each iteration. The variable `rem` will either be `0` or `k % (n - 1)` depending on how many times the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` was not met. The variable `k` will be reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all iterations, and it will be `0` if the condition was met for any `i`. The variable `r` will be either `a[n - 2] + k // (n - 1)` or `a[n - 1]` if the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is met for some `i`. Finally, `y` will be `0` since `n` becomes `0`.
