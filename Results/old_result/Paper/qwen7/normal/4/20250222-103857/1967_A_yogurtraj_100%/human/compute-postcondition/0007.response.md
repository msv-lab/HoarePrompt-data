Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(0, n - 1)`. This means `i` will take values from 0 to `n-2` (inclusive).

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, the initial value of `i` should be set to 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n - 1`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n - 1` for the loop to continue executing.

4. **Adjust the State of `n`**: For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `n-2`). If `n` were 1 or less, the loop would not execute at all.

5. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `rem`, `y`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop execution.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being set to 0 and `n` being greater than 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
