Output State: The loop will execute `n` times, with `i` ranging from 1 to `n`. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `n` can be any integer value that was initially set and remained unchanged throughout the loop executions.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the same value as `n`, and `n` can be any integer within the range of 1 to 500 (as per the initial condition).
