Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is 2 and `n` must be at least 1.
2. The `print` statement uses `*range(n, 0, -1)`, which means it will print the elements of a range starting from `n` down to 1, decrementing by 1 each time.
3. Since `n` must be at least 1, let's consider the minimum value for `n`, which is 1, to determine the output precisely.
4. If `n` is 1, then `range(n, 0, -1)` will generate the range from 1 to 0 (exclusive), resulting in an empty sequence.
5. Therefore, the `*range(n, 0, -1)` part will not print anything.
6. The `print` statement will then print `1` followed by `i`, which is 2, and no other values since the range is empty.

Given this reasoning, the output will be:

Output: **1 2**
