Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` must be at least 1, but no specific value is provided for `n`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

Here's the breakdown:

1. `2` is directly printed as is.
2. `i` is also directly printed as is, and it is given as 2.
3. `*range(n, 0, -1)` will generate a range of numbers from `n` down to 1 (exclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. Since `n` is at least 1, the range will include 1.

Therefore, if `n` is 1, the range will be `[1]`. If `n` is greater than 1, the range will include more numbers, starting from `n` and decreasing to 1.

Given that `n` is at least 1, let's consider the minimum case where `n` is 1 for simplicity:

- The range `range(1, 0, -1)` will generate `[1]`.

So, the output will be:
Output: **2 2 1**
