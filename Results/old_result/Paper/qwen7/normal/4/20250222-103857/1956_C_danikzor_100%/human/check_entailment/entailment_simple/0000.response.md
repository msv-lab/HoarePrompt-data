Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations, where each operation can either permute the rows or columns.
2. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:
   - The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is not relevant to the problem's requirements. This formula seems to be derived from a different mathematical context and does not relate to the sum of the matrix elements after performing the allowed operations.
   - The operations being performed (permuting rows and columns) are not designed to maximize the sum of the matrix elements. Instead, they simply reverse the order of elements in each row and column.
   - The operations do not ensure that the sum of the matrix elements is maximized. The goal is to fill the matrix with the largest possible values in each position, which would typically involve placing the largest numbers in the top-left corner and working downwards and to the right.

Given these observations, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
