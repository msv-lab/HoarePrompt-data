Output: **2 3 3 2 1** 

Explanation:
- The variable `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- The variable `n` must be at least 3, but its exact value is not specified. However, since `range(n, 0, -1)` is used, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 to produce a valid range. For the sake of this output, let's assume the minimum value of `n`, which is 3.
- The `range(n, 0, -1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from `n` down to 1 with a step of -1. If `n` is 3, then `range(3, 0, -1)` will generate the sequence `[3, 2, 1]`.
- Therefore, the `print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))` statement will print `2`, followed by the value of `i` (which is 3), and then the unpacked sequence generated by `range(n, 0, -1)`, resulting in `3 3 2 1`.
- Since `n` is at least 3, the output will be `2 3 3 2 1` assuming `n` is exactly 3.
