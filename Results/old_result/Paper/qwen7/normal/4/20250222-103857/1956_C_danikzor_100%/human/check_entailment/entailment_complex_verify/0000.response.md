### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The goal is to maximize the sum of the \(n \times n\) matrix using no more than \(2n\) operations.
- There are two types of operations:
  1. Type 1: Permute the elements of a chosen row.
  2. Type 2: Permute the elements of a chosen column.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case individually.
   
2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \(n\).
   - It then prints the maximum possible sum of the matrix and the number of operations required.
   - It prints \(2n\) operations, but these operations do not actually change the matrix.

3. **Operations:**
   - The program prints \(2n\) operations, each of which is a permutation of the form \([n, n-1, ..., 1]\) for each row and column.
   - This means that for each row and column, the program prints a permutation where the largest number is placed in the last position, the second largest in the second last position, and so on.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the maximum possible sum and the number of operations.
   - For a given \(n\), the maximum possible sum is calculated using the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \).
   - The number of operations is always \(2n\).

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Sum Calculation:**
  - The formula \(\frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6}\) is derived from the sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers and their permutations. This formula is correct for calculating the maximum possible sum of the matrix.
  
- **Number of Operations:**
  - The program prints \(2n\) operations, which is within the allowed limit of \(2n\).

- **Matrix Operations:**
  - The operations printed are indeed permutations, but they do not change the matrix in a way that would maximize the sum. Instead, they simply permute the elements in a specific order.

Given the above analysis, the program does not actually perform the operations to maximize the sum of the matrix. The operations printed are just permutations of the form \([n, n-1, ..., 1]\), which do not contribute to maximizing the sum.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
