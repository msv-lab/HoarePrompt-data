Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the list `nums` is created from the input split by spaces, the first element of `nums` is converted to an integer and assigned to `num1`, the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element, `numbers` is a list containing `[num1, num2]`, `num2` is the second element of `nums` converted to an integer, `num1` is an integer, `num2` is an integer, `num1` is an integer equal to the first element of `nums`, `num2` is an integer equal to the second element of `nums`, either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or the program continues to execute normally.**

Explanation: The code `num1 = int(nums[0])` assigns the first element of the list `nums`, which is converted to an integer, to the variable `num1`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
