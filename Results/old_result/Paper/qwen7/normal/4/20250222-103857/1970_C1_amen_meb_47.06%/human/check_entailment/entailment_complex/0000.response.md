Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` is supposed to read pairs of integers from input until the input no longer consists of exactly two elements.
   - However, the problem statement specifies that `t = 1` and the input for the starting node is provided directly in the input, not through repeated user input. Therefore, the function `func_1()` should not be reading any input since `t = 1`.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program expects the function `func_1()` to return a list of pairs of integers, but according to the problem, `func_1()` should not be returning any such list. Instead, it should process the input directly.
   - The logic in the main program to count the number of times `num1` is greater than `num2` and vice versa is irrelevant because the function `func_1()` is incorrectly designed and does not align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Given `t = 1`, the main program should directly use the provided starting node and determine the winner based on the structure of the tree and the optimal strategy.
   - Since the tree has exactly two leaves and is structured like an array, the game's outcome can be determined by the position of the starting node relative to the center of the array.

Given these points, the current implementation is incorrect because it does not follow the problem's specifications and the function `func_1()` is not needed. The main program should directly determine the winner based on the starting node without calling `func_1()`.

Correctness: **False**
