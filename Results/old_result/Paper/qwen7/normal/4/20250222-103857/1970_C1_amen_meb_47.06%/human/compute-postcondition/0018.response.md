The `while True` loop does not have any conditions based on the variables `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `nums`, `num1`, `num2`, `numbers`, etc., in its head. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the list `nums` is created from the input split by spaces, the first element of `nums` is converted to an integer and assigned to `num1`, the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element, `numbers` is a list containing `[num1, num2]`, `num2` is the second element of `nums` converted to an integer, `numbers` is a list containing `[num1, num2]`**
