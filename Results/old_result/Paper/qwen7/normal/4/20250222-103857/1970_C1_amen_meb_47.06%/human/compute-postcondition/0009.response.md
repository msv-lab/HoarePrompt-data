Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the list `nums` is created from the input split by spaces, the first element of `nums` is converted to an integer and assigned to `num1`, the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element, `numbers` is an empty list, `num2` is the second element of `nums` converted to an integer.**

In this output state, `num2` is assigned the value of the second element in the `nums` list, which was converted to an integer. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
