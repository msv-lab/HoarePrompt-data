Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element; `numbers` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    nums = input().split()
    if len(nums) != 2:
        break
    num1 = int(nums[0])
    num2 = int(nums[1])
    numbers.append([num1, num2])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the list `nums` is created from the input split by spaces, the first element of `nums` is converted to an integer and assigned to `num1`, the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element, `numbers` is a list containing `[num1, num2]`, `num2` is the second element of `nums` converted to an integer.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the list `nums` is created from the input split by spaces, the first element of `nums` is converted to an integer and assigned to `num1`, the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element, `numbers` is a list containing `[num1, num2]`, `num2` is the second element of `nums` converted to an integer, `numbers` is a list containing `[num1, num2]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `nums` is a list created from the input split by spaces, `num1` is the first element of `nums` converted to an integer, `numbers` is a list containing `[num1, num2]`, `num2` is the second element of `nums` converted to an integer, and `numbers` is now a list containing `[num1, num2]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
