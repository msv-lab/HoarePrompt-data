You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, u and v are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element.
def func_1():
    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        
        if len(nums) != 2:
            break
        
        num1 = int(nums[0])
        
        num2 = int(nums[1])
        
        numbers.append([num1, num2])
        
    #State: Output State: The list `numbers` contains all pairs of integers `[num1, num2]` entered as input until the input no longer consists of exactly two elements. The variables `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` retain their initial values or states as described in the initial state, with `n` being an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` being 1, `u` and `v` being integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `numbers` will contain all the pairs of integers provided as input until the input does not consist of exactly two elements. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `u`, `v`) will remain unchanged from their initial states.
    return numbers
    #The program returns the list `numbers` which contains all pairs of integers `[num1, num2]` entered as input until the input no longer consists of exactly two elements. The variables `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` retain their initial values: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes input pairs of integers `[num1, num2]` until the input no longer consists of exactly two elements. During this process, it retains the initial values of `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v`: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element. The function returns a list `numbers` containing all processed pairs of integers.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `numbers` which contains all pairs of integers `[num1, num2]` entered as input until the input no longer consists of exactly two elements. The variables `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` retain their initial values: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
