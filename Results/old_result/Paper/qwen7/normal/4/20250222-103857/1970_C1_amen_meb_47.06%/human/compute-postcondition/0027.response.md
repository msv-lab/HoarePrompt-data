Output State: **The program returns the list `numbers` which contains all pairs of integers `[num1, num2]` entered as input until the input no longer consists of exactly two elements. The variables `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` retain their initial values: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element.**

This means the program returns the list `numbers` as it was built up from the inputs provided, along with the unchanged values of `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v`.
