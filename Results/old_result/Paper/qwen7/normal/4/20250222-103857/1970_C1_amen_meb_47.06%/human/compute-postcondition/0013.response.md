Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the list `nums` is created from the input split by spaces, the first element of `nums` is converted to an integer and assigned to `num1`, the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element, `numbers` is a list containing `[num1, num2]`, `num2` is the second element of `nums` converted to an integer, `num1` is an integer, `num2` is an integer, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since no loop or if statement was specified in the code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement that was implied. All other variables retain their initial values.
