Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `nums` is a list created from the input split by spaces, `num1` is the first element of `nums` converted to an integer, `numbers` is a list containing `[num1, num2]`, `num2` is the second element of `nums` converted to an integer, and `numbers` is now a list containing `[num1, num2]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the list `[num1, num2]` to the `numbers` list. Since `num1` and `num2` are already defined as the first and second elements of `nums` respectively, the `numbers` list is updated to include this new list. All other variables remain unchanged.
