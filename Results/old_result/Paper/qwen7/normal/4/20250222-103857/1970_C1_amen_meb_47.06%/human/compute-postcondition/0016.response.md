Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the list `nums` is created from the input split by spaces, the first element of `nums` is converted to an integer and assigned to `num1`, the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element, `numbers` is a list containing `[num1, num2]`, `num2` is the second element of `nums` converted to an integer, `num1` is an integer equal to the first element of `nums`, `num2` is an integer equal to the second element of `nums`, `num2` is an integer equal to the second element of `nums`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `num2 = int(nums[1])` simply assigns the second element of the list `nums`, which was already converted to an integer and stored as `num2`, to itself again. Therefore, the value of `num2` remains unchanged. All other variables and their states remain the same as the initial state.
