Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. The program seems to be attempting to process input from standard input and compare pairs of numbers, but it does not handle the tree structure or the game rules appropriately.

Specifically, the program `func_1()` reads pairs of numbers from input, but the problem description does not require reading input from standard input. Instead, the input should be provided as part of the function call or through predefined lists. The program also does not simulate the game rounds or determine the winner based on the optimal moves of Ron and Hermione.

Given the problem description, the program should:
1. Construct the tree from the edges provided.
2. Simulate the game for each starting node.
3. Determine the winner based on optimal play.

Since the provided program does not implement these steps, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
