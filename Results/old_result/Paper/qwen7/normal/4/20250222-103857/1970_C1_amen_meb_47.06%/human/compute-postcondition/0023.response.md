Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `nums` is a list created from the input split by spaces, `num1` is the first element of `nums` converted to an integer, `numbers` is a list containing `[num1, num2]`, `num2` is the second element of `nums` converted to an integer, and `num2` is assigned the value of the second element of `nums`.**

In this step, the code assigns the value of the second element of the list `nums` to the variable `num2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
