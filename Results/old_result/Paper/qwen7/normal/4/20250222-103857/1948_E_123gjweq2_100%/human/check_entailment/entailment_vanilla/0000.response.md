Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters `n` and `k`.
   - It calculates the number of cliques needed as `ceil(n / k)` and initializes arrays `arr` and `cliquess` with zeros.
   - It calls the helper function `make_array` to fill the `arr` array and `cliquess` array.
   - It prints the `arr` array, the number of cliques, and the `cliquess` array.

2. **Function `make_array`**:
   - The function `make_array` takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`.
   - It calculates the middle index and the non-middle indices.
   - It fills the `arr` array such that the first half of the range `[left, right]` is filled with smaller elements and the second half with larger elements.
   - It assigns the `clique` value to the corresponding indices in the `cliquess` array.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The `arr` array is initialized to zero, which means all vertices start with the same value.
   - The `cliquess` array is also initialized to zero, indicating all vertices start in the same clique.

2. **Filling the Array**:
   - The `make_array` function ensures that the first half of the range `[left, right]` is filled with smaller elements and the second half with larger elements.
   - This ensures that for any pair `(i, j)` where `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`, they will be in the same clique because their values will be close enough due to the way the array is filled.

3. **Partitioning into Cliques**:
   - The `cliquess` array is filled such that vertices in the same segment of the array are assigned the same clique.
   - This ensures that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

4. **Output**:
   - The output satisfies the requirements: distinct integers from 1 to n for `arr`, the number of cliques, and the correct partitioning for `cliquess`.

### Example Walkthrough

- For the input `2 3`:
  - `cliques = ceil(2 / 3) = 1`
  - `arr = [1, 2]` (since the first half is filled with smaller elements and the second half with larger elements)
  - `cliquess = [1, 1]`
  - Output: `1 1 1`

- For the input `5 4`:
  - `cliques = ceil(5 / 4) = 2`
  - `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - `cliquess = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`
  - Output: `3 2 1 2 2`

- For the input `8 16`:
  - `cliques = ceil(8 / 16) = 1`
  - `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
  - `cliquess = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Output: `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to assign values to vertices and partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques based on the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
