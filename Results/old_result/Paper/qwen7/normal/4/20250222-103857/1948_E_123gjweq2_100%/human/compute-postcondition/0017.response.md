Output State: **`cliquess[left + mid + i]' is set to `clique', `arr[left + mid + i]' is set to `big_element - i'**.

Explanation: The code updates two variables. First, it sets `cliquess[left + mid + i]` to the value of `clique`. Second, it updates `arr[left + mid + i]` to `big_element - i`. The initial state of `arr[left + mid + i]' being set to `big_element - i' remains unchanged in terms of the relationship, only the variable it is assigned to changes.
