Output State: The loop runs for `mid` iterations. After all iterations, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` will be set to `small_element + i` for each `i` from `0` to `mid-1`. Additionally, `cliquess[left + i]` will be set to `clique` for each `i` from `0` to `mid-1`. All other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid`) remain unchanged.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the array `arr` will have elements from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` placed in positions starting from `left + mid - 1` and going backwards to `left`. The list `cliquess` will have the value `clique` assigned to each index from `left` to `left + mid - 1`.
