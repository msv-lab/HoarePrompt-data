Reasoning:
1. The problem requires creating a graph and partitioning it into the minimum possible number of cliques based on the given conditions.
2. The solution provided uses a simplified approach to assign values to vertices and create partitions, but we need to verify if this approach meets the problem's requirements.
3. The `func_1` function calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)` and then calls `make_array` to fill the arrays `arr` and `cliquess`.
4. The `make_array` function fills the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays based on the specified logic.
5. We need to check if the generated `arr` and `cliquess` arrays satisfy the condition for forming cliques in the graph.

Let's analyze the correctness of the solution:

- The number of cliques is correctly calculated as `ceil(n / k)`.
- The `make_array` function fills the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays in a way that ensures vertices within the same segment (determined by `left` and `right`) will form a clique if they are within the distance constraint `k`.

Given the constraints and the logic used:
- For each clique, the `make_array` function ensures that the difference in indices and values is within the limit `k`, thus forming a clique.
- The `cliquess` array ensures that each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

Based on the provided execution summaries and the logic used, the solution appears to meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
