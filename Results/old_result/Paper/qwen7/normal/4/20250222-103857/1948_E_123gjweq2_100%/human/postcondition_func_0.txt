The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 40, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * `n`. It calculates the number of cliques (`cliques`) as the ceiling of `n` divided by `k`. The function then uses the `make_array` function to fill an array `arr` with values from 0 to `n-1` based on the calculated cliques. After filling the array, it prints the array, the number of cliques, and another array `cliquess` which is set to `[1, 1, ..., 4]` depending on the values of `n` and `k`. The final state of the program includes the printed output of the array, the number of cliques, and the array `cliquess`.
