You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, and clique is an integer representing the clique identifier.
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: The loop runs for `mid` iterations. After all iterations, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` will be set to `small_element + i` for each `i` from `0` to `mid-1`. Additionally, `cliquess[left + i]` will be set to `clique` for each `i` from `0` to `mid-1`. All other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid`) remain unchanged.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the array `arr` will have elements from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` placed in positions starting from `left + mid - 1` and going backwards to `left`. The list `cliquess` will have the value `clique` assigned to each index from `left` to `left + mid - 1`.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: All elements in `cliquess` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` are set to `clique`. All elements in `arr` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` are set to values ranging from `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` to `big_element`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the array `arr` will have elements from `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` to `big_element` placed in positions starting from `left + mid` and going forwards to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`. The list `cliquess` will have the value `clique` assigned to each index from `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `left` and `right`, which are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, and `clique`, which is an integer representing the clique identifier. The function returns an array (or list) based on the given range and clique identifier.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
