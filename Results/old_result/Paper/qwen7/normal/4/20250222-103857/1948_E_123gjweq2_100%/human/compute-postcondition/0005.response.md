Output State: **`left` is an integer such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\), `right` is an integer such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\) and \(\text{right} - \text{left} \geq 2\), `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is \(\text{left} + 1\), `big_element` is \(\text{right} + 1\), `mid` is \(\frac{\text{right} - \text{left}}{2}\), `not_mid` is \(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \text{mid}\), `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is updated to `small_element + i` for each valid `i`.**

Explanation: The code updates the element in the array `arr` at the index `left + mid - i - 1` to the value `small_element + i`. Since `small_element` is defined as `\text{left} + 1`, and `mid` is defined as `\frac{\text{right} - \text{left}}{2}`, the specific index and value assignment are as described. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
