Output State: All elements in `cliquess` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` are set to `clique`. All elements in `arr` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` are set to values ranging from `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` to `big_element`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the array `arr` will have elements from `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` to `big_element` placed in positions starting from `left + mid` and going forwards to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`. The list `cliquess` will have the value `clique` assigned to each index from `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`.
