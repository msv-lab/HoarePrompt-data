You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

- Program:
from math import ceil
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

#Function 2:
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `make_array` takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It creates an array where elements from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` are placed in reverse order starting from `left + mid - 1` and going backwards to `left`. The list `cliquess` has the value `clique` assigned to each index from `left` to `left + mid - 1`. Additionally, elements from `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` to `big_element` are placed in order starting from `left + mid` and going forwards to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`. The list `cliquess` also has the value `clique` assigned to each index from `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`. The function modifies the global arrays `arr` and `cliquess` but does not return anything.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters `n` and `k`.
   - It calculates the number of cliques needed as `ceil(n / k)` and initializes arrays `arr` and `cliquess` with zeros.
   - It calls the helper function `make_array` to fill the `arr` array and `cliquess` array.
   - It prints the `arr` array, the number of cliques, and the `cliquess` array.

2. **Function `make_array`**:
   - The function `make_array` takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`.
   - It calculates the middle index and the non-middle indices.
   - It fills the `arr` array such that the first half of the range `[left, right]` is filled with smaller elements and the second half with larger elements.
   - It assigns the `clique` value to the corresponding indices in the `cliquess` array.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The `arr` array is initialized to zero, which means all vertices start with the same value.
   - The `cliquess` array is also initialized to zero, indicating all vertices start in the same clique.

2. **Filling the Array**:
   - The `make_array` function ensures that the first half of the range `[left, right]` is filled with smaller elements and the second half with larger elements.
   - This ensures that for any pair `(i, j)` where `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`, they will be in the same clique because their values will be close enough due to the way the array is filled.

3. **Partitioning into Cliques**:
   - The `cliquess` array is filled such that vertices in the same segment of the array are assigned the same clique.
   - This ensures that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

4. **Output**:
   - The output satisfies the requirements: distinct integers from 1 to n for `arr`, the number of cliques, and the correct partitioning for `cliquess`.

### Example Walkthrough

- For the input `2 3`:
  - `cliques = ceil(2 / 3) = 1`
  - `arr = [1, 2]` (since the first half is filled with smaller elements and the second half with larger elements)
  - `cliquess = [1, 1]`
  - Output: `1 1 1`

- For the input `5 4`:
  - `cliques = ceil(5 / 4) = 2`
  - `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - `cliquess = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`
  - Output: `3 2 1 2 2`

- For the input `8 16`:
  - `cliques = ceil(8 / 16) = 1`
  - `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
  - `cliquess = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Output: `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to assign values to vertices and partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques based on the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
