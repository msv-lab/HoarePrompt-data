Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop runs for `mid` iterations. After all iterations, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` will be set to `small_element + i` for each `i` from `0` to `mid-1`. Additionally, `cliquess[left + i]` will be set to `clique` for each `i` from `0` to `mid-1`. All other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid`) remain unchanged.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the array `arr` will have elements from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` placed in positions starting from `left + mid - 1` and going backwards to `left`. The list `cliquess` will have the value `clique` assigned to each index from `left` to `left + mid - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(not_mid):
    arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
    cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cliquess[left + mid + i]' is set to `clique', `arr[left + mid + i]' is set to `big_element - i'

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cliquess[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` is set to `clique`, `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` is set to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`, and for each `i` from 0 to `not_mid - 1`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is set to `clique`. For each `i` from 0 to `not_mid - 1`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is set to `clique`, and `i` is now `not_mid`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
