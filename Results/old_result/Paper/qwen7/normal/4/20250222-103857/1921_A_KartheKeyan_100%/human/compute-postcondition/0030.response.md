Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is 1, `coord` is [(x, y), (second_x, second_y)], `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the second and first points in `coord`, `p2` is the sum of the squares of the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates between the fourth and third points in `coord`, the values of `x` and `y` are updated by `map(int, input().split())**.

Explanation: The code appends a new point `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Initially, `coord` contains only one point, which is `(second_x, second_y)`. After appending `(x, y)`, `coord` now contains two points: the original point and the new point. The values of `total`, `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged from their initial states. The values of `x` and `y` are updated by the user input through `map(int, input().split())`.
