Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` must be non-zero, `coord` contains four tuples of coordinates sorted by the first element, `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the second and first points in `coord`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the squared Euclidean distance between the first two points in the `coord` list, which are represented by `coord[0]` and `coord[1]`. This distance is computed using the formula \((x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2\), where \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) are the coordinates of the first and second points respectively. The result is stored in the variable `p1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
