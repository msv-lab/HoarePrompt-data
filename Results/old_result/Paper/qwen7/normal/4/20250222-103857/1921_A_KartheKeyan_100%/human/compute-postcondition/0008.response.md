Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(4):`. The variables involved here are `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is 0
   - `n` must be non-zero
   - `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`
   - `i` is 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 4.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than 4. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1.

5. **Check other variables**:
   - `res` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it.
   - `coord` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it.

Given these points, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final State**:
State: **`res` is 0, `n` must be non-zero, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`, `i` is 1**
