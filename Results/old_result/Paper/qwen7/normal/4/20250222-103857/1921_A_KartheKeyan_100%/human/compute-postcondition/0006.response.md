Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` must be non-zero, `coord` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them into integers, assigning `x` to the first integer and `y` to the second integer. The other variables (`res`, `n`, `coord`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
