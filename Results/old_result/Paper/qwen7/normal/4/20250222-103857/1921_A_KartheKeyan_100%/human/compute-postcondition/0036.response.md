Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is 4, `coord` is a list containing four tuples sorted by their first elements, `i` is 3, `x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer from input, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the second and first points in `coord`, `p2` is the sum of the squares of the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates between the fourth and third points in `coord`.**

Explanation: The code `coord = sorted(coord)` sorts the list `coord` based on the first element of each tuple. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of the tuples in `coord`, they are sorted based on their first elements. The values of `total`, `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged as no new assignments or calculations are performed.
