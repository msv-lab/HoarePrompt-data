Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` is 3, `coord` is [(`x`, `y`), (input integer, input integer), (`x`, `y`), (input integer, input integer)], `p1` is (input integer - `x`)² + (input integer - `y`)², `res` is 0, `x` is the last input integer, `y` is the last input integer.**

Explanation: The code calculates the Euclidean distance squared between the second and first points in the `coord` list. The coordinates of these points are `(x, y)` and `(input integer, input integer)`. Therefore, `p1` is updated to the value `(input integer - x)² + (input integer - y)²`. The other variables remain unchanged.
