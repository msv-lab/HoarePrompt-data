Output State: `total` is 0, `n` is 4, `coord` is a list containing 4 tuples, each tuple is `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are integers from input, `i` is 3, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the second and first points in `coord`, `p2` is the sum of the squares of the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates between the fourth and third points in `coord`.

This means after the loop completes all its iterations (4 times), the variable `res` remains 0 because it was never modified inside the loop. The variable `n` becomes 4 as it starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration. The list `coord` will contain 4 points provided as input, with each point being a tuple of two integers `(x, y)`. The variable `i` reaches 3 after the last iteration. The value of `p1` is calculated based on the coordinates of the second and first points, and `p2` is calculated based on the coordinates of the fourth and third points in the list `coord`.
