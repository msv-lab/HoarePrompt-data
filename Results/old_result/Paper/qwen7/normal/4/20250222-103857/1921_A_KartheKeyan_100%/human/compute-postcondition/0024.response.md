Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` is 1, `coord` is an empty list, `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the second and first points in `coord`, `p2` is the sum of the squares of the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates between the fourth and third points in `coord`.**

Explanation: The line `res = 0` sets the variable `res` to 0. All other variables (`n`, `coord`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
