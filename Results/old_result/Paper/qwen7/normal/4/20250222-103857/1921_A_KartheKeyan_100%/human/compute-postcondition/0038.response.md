Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is 4, `coord` is a list containing four tuples sorted by their first elements, `i` is 3, `x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer from input, `p1` is (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])² + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])², `p2` is (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])² + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])².**

Explanation: The code calculates `p2` as the squared Euclidean distance between the last two tuples in the `coord` list. Since the `coord` list is sorted by the first elements of the tuples, `p2` is computed using the last two tuples in the list. The values of `total`, `n`, `coord`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and `p1` remain unchanged.
