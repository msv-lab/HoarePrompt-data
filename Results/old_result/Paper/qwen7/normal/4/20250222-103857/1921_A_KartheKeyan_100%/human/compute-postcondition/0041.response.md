Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is 3, `coord` is a list containing four tuples sorted by their first elements, `i` is 3, `x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer from input, `p1` is (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])**.

Explanation: The value of `n` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
