Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is 3, `coord` is [(x, y)], `x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer from input, `p1` is 0, `res` is 0, where `x` and `y` are integers obtained from input.**

The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The other variables (`total`, `i`, `n`, `coord`, `p1`, and `res`) remain unchanged.
