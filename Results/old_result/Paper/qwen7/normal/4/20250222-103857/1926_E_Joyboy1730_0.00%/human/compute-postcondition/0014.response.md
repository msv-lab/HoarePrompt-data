Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 5 â‹… 10^4, `n` is 0 or negative, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `_` is 1, `m` is not defined since the loop has terminated.

After all iterations of the loop, `n` will eventually become 0 or negative because the loop reduces `n` by `m` where `m` is always at least 1. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and not modified within the loop. The variable `_` remains 1 as it was also not modified within the loop. The variable `L` remains an empty list as it was not involved in the loop. The variable `m` is not defined outside the loop once the loop terminates.
