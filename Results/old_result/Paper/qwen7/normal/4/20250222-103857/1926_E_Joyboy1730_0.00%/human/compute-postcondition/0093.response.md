Output State: **`pow` will be \(2 \times \text{current pow}\), `tot` will be \(\text{current tot} + a\), `k` will be \(\text{current k} - 1\), `n` will be \(\text{current n} + 1\), `L` is an empty list, `m` is \((\text{current n} + 1) // 2\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `n` must be at least 1.**

Explanation: The code calculates `m` as `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` is an input integer, `m` will be the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
