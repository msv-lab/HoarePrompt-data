Output State: **`tot` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and `a` is an integer. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `tot`, `k`, or `a`. It only indicates that the execution will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no new assignments or operations are performed, the values of `tot`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.
