State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 5 ⋅ 10^4, inclusive, and `_` is now 1**.

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is used as a placeholder and typically does not hold a specific value that needs to be adjusted. However, the condition for the loop to execute is based on the value of `t`.
- The variable `t` determines how many times the loop will run. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a valid integer within the specified range (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4).

Thus, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring `t` is within the given range.
