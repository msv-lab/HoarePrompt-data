Output State: **`tot` is now `tot + a + a`, `k` is now `2 * (k - tot - a)`, and `pow` is now `pow * 2`.**

Explanation: The code `tot += a` increments the value of `tot` by `a`. Given the initial state where `tot` is now `tot + a`, the new value of `tot` becomes `tot + a + a`. The values of `k` and `pow` remain unchanged from their initial state. The loop that might have contained this line has broken out of it.
