Output State: **`pow` will be \(2 \times \text{current pow}\), `tot` will be \(\text{current tot} + a\), `k` will be \(\text{current k} - 1\), `n` will be \(\text{current n} - m\) and must be greater than `m`, `L` is an empty list, `m` is \((\text{current n} + 1) // 2\), `k` is an input integer, and `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1; `n` is decreased by `m`.**

This means that the value of `n` is updated by subtracting `m` from its current value, while all other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
