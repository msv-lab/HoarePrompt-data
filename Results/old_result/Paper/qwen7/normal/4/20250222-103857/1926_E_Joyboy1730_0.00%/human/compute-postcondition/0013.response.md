Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 5 â‹… 10^4, `n` is 0 or negative, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `_` is 1, `m` is not defined because `n` is no longer positive.

After all iterations of the loop, `n` will eventually become 0 or negative since the loop reduces `n` by `(n + 1) // 2` in each iteration, and this process continues until `n` is no longer greater than 0. At this point, the loop terminates. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was initially set and is not modified within the loop. The variable `L` remains empty as it is not affected by the loop. The variable `_` remains 1 as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `m` is no longer defined because the loop condition `n` is no longer true.
