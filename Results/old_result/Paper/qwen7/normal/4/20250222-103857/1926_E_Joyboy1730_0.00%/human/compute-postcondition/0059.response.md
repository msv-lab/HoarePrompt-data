Output State: `L` is an empty list, `pow` is 16, `m` is 0, `tot` is 0, `n` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to subtract `(n + 1) // 2` from `n` until `n` becomes 0. After the third iteration, `n` is reduced to 0, and since the condition `n` is checked at the start of the loop, it will no longer execute. Therefore, both `m` and `n` become 0, and `tot` remains 0 as there are no further additions or subtractions affecting it.
