Output State: **`tot` is now `tot + a + a`, `k` is now `3 * (k - 3 * tot - 3 * a)`, `pow` is now `pow * 2 * 2`, and `pow` is equal to `4 * pow`.**

Explanation: The code `pow *= 2` multiplies the current value of `pow` by 2. Given that `pow` was previously set to `pow * 2`, the new value of `pow` is `pow * 2 * 2`, which simplifies to `4 * pow`. The values of `tot` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
