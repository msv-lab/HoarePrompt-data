Output State: **`k` is now `k - (tot + a)`, `pow` is 2, `m` is 0, `tot` is `tot + a`, `a` is the next element in the list `L`, `n` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `k -= tot` subtracts the value of `tot` from `k`. Since `tot` was previously `tot + a`, the new value of `k` becomes `k - (tot + a)`. The values of `pow`, `m`, `tot` (which is now `tot + a`), `a`, and `n` remain unchanged.
