Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 â‹… 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `_` is 1, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to the variable `m`. Since `n` is greater than 1, the value of `m` will be an integer calculated from `(n + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
