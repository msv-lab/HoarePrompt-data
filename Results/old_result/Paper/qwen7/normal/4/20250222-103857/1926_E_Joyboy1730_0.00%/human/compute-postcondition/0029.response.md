Based on the initial state provided, we know that `L` must have at least one element. However, no specific values or additional context about `pow` or `k` is given. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical value that will be printed. We can only describe the expression that will be evaluated.

Output: **pow * (2 * k - 1)**
