Output State: `L` is an empty list, `pow` is 16, `m` is 0, `tot` is 0, `n` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to subtract `(n + 1) // 2` from `n` until `n` becomes 0. After the third iteration, `n` was reduced to 0, which means the condition `n` in the while loop head evaluates to `False`. Therefore, the loop terminates. At this point, `m` will also be 0 because it is recalculated as `(n + 1) // 2` where `n` is now 0. The variables `pow`, `tot`, and `L` remain unchanged from their initial or previous states since they are not affected by the loop.
