Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `L` is a list of integers, `R` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `ans` is the result of either math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) when `i` equals `L[cur]`, or math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (L[-1] - 2) % MOD when `i` does not equal `L[cur]`, `cur` is M1 - 2, `L[-1]` is equal to `R[0]`, `L[0]` is equal to 1, `R[0]` is equal to `N`, `M1` is greater than 1, and either `M2` is less than or equal to 1 or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`; `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, and `N` must be greater than 2.
