Output State: **`nums_left` is decreased by 1, `i` is equal to `i + 1`, `i` is less than `N - 1`. If `i` equals `R[cur]`, then `cur` is `i + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated by multiplying the current value of `ans` by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, and `i` remains less than `N - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was previously less than `N - 1`, after incrementing, `i` is now equal to `i + 1`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
