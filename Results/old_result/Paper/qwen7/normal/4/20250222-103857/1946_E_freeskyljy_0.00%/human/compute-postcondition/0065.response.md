Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < N`.
2. **Current State**: 
   - `i` has been increased by 1.
   - `nums_left` is \(N - R[0] - 2\).

3. **Determine the Adjustment Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < N` must be true.
   - Currently, `i` has been increased by 1, but we don't know the exact value of `i` or `N` from the given information.
   - To ensure the loop can execute again, `i` must be less than `N`.

Given that `i` has just been increased by 1, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i + 1` must be less than `N`, which means `i` must be less than `N - 1`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `N - 1` for the loop to execute one more time.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - We need to adjust the state such that `i` is less than `N - 1`.

Since the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`, and we need to ensure `i < N - 1`, we need to set `i` to a value that satisfies this condition.

**Final State**:
- `i` must be less than `N - 1`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is less than `N - 1`**
