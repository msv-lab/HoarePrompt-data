Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `L` is a list of integers, `R` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `ans` is the result of math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), L[-1] is equal to R[0], L[0] is equal to 1, and R[0] is equal to N, and either M1 is less than or equal to 1 or M2 is less than or equal to 1 or L[-2] is not equal to R[1]**.

Explanation: The code calculates `ans` using the combination formula `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. Here, `N` is the first element of the list `R`, and `L[-1]` is the last element of the list `L`. The other variables remain unchanged.
