Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `L` is a list of integers, `R` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `ans` is either the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` if `i` equals `R[cur]`, or `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * nums_left % MOD` if `i` does not equal `R[cur]`, `cur` is either `R[0] + 2` or `R[0] + 1`, `nums_left` is \(N - R[0] - 1\), and `M2` is greater than 1.
