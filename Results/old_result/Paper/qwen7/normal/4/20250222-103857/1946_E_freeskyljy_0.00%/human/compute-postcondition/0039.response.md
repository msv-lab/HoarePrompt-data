Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i > 1`.
2. **Current State**: 
   - `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`
   - `i` is `i - 1`
   - `ans` is updated based on certain conditions.

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we can only adjust `i`.

4. **Check the Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 1. Since `i` was decremented in the last iteration, the new value of `i` is `i - 1`.

5. **Adjust the State**: To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` must be greater than 1 after the decrement. This means before the decrement, `i` must have been 2 or greater.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is 2 or greater before the decrement operation.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`, `i` is 2 or greater, and `ans` is updated based on the given conditions.**
