Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `L` is a list of integers, `R` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `ans` is the result of math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), `cur` is M1 - 2, and either `M1` is less than or equal to 1 or `M2` is less than or equal to 1 or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`. If `M1 > 1`, `nums_left` is set to `L[-1] - 1`, `i` is 0, and `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, no changes occur.**
