Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `L` is a list of integers, `R` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `ans` is the final computed value based on the loop operations, `cur` is M1 - 2, `nums_left` is 0, and either `M1` is less than or equal to 1 or `M2` is less than or equal to 1 or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`.
