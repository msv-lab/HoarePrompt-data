Output State: **`ans` is the value of `ans` multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, and `i` is less than `N - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` and then taking the modulo `MOD`. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still less than `N - 1`.
