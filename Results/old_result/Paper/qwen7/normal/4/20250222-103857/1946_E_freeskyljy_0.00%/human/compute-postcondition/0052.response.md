Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `L` is a list of integers, `R` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `ans` is the result of math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), `cur` is 1, `nums_left` is N - R[0] - 1, and `M2` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is assigned the value `1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
