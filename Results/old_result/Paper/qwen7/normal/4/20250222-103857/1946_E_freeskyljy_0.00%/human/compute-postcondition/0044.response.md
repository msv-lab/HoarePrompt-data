Output State: **`nums_left` is `L[-1] - 5`, `i` is 2 or greater, and `ans` is updated based on the following conditions: if `i` equals `L[cur]`, then `cur` is decremented by 1; otherwise, `ans` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`.**

Explanation: The variable `nums_left` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `L[-1] - 5`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
