Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < N`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `nums_left` is decreased by 1.
   - `i` is equal to `i + 1`.
   - `i` is less than `N - 1`.
   - If `i` equals `R[cur]`, then `cur` is `i + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` is updated by multiplying the current value of `ans` by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, and `i` remains less than `N - 1`.

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop condition depends on the variable `i` and `N`.
   - We need to ensure that `i < N` for the loop to execute again.

4. **Analyze the current state**:
   - From the given information, `i` is less than `N - 1` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `N`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is currently less than `N - 1`, to ensure `i < N`, we need to adjust `N` such that it is greater than `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`nums_left` is decreased by 1, `i` is equal to `i + 1`, `i` is less than `N` (where `N` must be greater than `i + 1`)**.
