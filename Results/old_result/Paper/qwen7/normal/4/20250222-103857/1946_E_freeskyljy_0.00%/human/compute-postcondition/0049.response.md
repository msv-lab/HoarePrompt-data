Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `L` is a list of integers, `R` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `ans` is the result of math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), `cur` is M1 - 2, `nums_left` is N - R[0] - 1, and either `M1` is less than or equal to 1 or `M2` is less than or equal to 1 or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `N - R[0] - 1` to `nums_left`. Since `R` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `R[0]` is the first element of this list. The value of `N` is not specified in the initial state, so it remains as `N`. All other variables remain unchanged.
