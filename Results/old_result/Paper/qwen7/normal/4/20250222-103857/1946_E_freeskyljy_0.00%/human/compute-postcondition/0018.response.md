Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `L` is a list of integers, `R` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `ans` is the result of math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), `cur` is M1 - 2, L[-1] is equal to R[0], L[0] is equal to 1, and R[0] is equal to N, and either M1 is less than or equal to 1 or M2 is less than or equal to 1 or L[-2] is not equal to R[1]**.

Explanation: The code `cur = M1 - 2` assigns the value of `M1 - 2` to the variable `cur`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
