Output State: **`nums_left` is `L[-1] - 5`, `i` is 1 or greater, and `ans` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`.**

Explanation: 
- The value of `i` is decremented by 1. Since `i` was initially 2 or greater, after decrementing, `i` will now be 1 or greater.
- The values of `nums_left` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state because the code only affects `i`.
