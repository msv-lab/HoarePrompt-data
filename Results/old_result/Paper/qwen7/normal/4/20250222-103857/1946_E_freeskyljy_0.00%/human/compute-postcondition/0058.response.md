Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `L` is a list of integers, `R` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `cur` is `R[0] + 1`, `nums_left` is \(N - R[0] - 1\), and `M2` is greater than 1, and `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`.
