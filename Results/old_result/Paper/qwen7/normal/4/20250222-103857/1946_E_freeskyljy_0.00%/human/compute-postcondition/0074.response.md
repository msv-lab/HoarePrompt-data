Output State: **`nums_left` is decreased by 2, `i` is equal to `i + 1`, `ans` is `ans * (nums_left - 1) % MOD`, `i` is less than `N`**

Explanation: 
- `nums_left` is decreased by 1 due to the initial state.
- The code `ans = ans * nums_left % MOD` updates `ans` by multiplying it with the current value of `nums_left` and then taking modulo `MOD`.
- Since `nums_left` was already decreased by 1, it is now decreased by 1 again, making it decreased by 2 in total.
- `i` is updated to `i + 1` due to the initial state.
- The condition `i` is less than `N` remains true since `i` is only incremented by 1 and `N` is greater than `i + 1`.
