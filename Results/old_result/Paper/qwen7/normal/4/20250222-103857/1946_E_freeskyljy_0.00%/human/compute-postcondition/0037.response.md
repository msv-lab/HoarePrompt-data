Output State: **`nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`, `i` is greater than 3, and `ans` is updated based on the following conditions: if `i` equals `L[cur]`, then `cur` is set to `cur - 1`; otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 4) % MOD`.**

Explanation: The code `nums_left -= 1` decreases the value of `nums_left` by 1. Since `nums_left` was initially `L[-1] - 3`, after the operation, it becomes `L[-1] - 4`. The values of `i` and `ans` remain unchanged as they were not affected by this line of code. The condition for updating `cur` and `ans` remains the same.
