Output State: **`nums_left` is decreased by 1, `i` is equal to `i + 1`, if `i == R[cur]`, then `i` is equal to `i + 2`, otherwise `i` is equal to `i + 1`, and if the `else` part is executed, `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left - 1) % MOD`. `i` is less than `N`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The other variables (`nums_left`, `R[cur]`, `cur`, `N`, `ans`, and `MOD`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so their states remain as described in the initial state. The condition checking in the `if-else` statement is not executed here, so the specific behavior of updating `ans` is not triggered.
