Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` and `n` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` must satisfy `r - l > 1`, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`**.

This means that the variable `mid` has been calculated as the floor division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2. All other variables (`array`, `n`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
