To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition `r - l > 1`.

Given the loop head:
```python
while r - l > 1:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` and `n` must be greater than 1.
- If `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, `l` is set to `mid`.
- Otherwise, `r` is set to `mid`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `r - l > 1` must still hold true. This means that after the last iteration, `r - l` should still be greater than 1.

Let's analyze the possible scenarios:

1. **If `array[mid] <= find`:**
   - `l` is updated to `mid`.
   - The new value of `l` could be such that `r - l` is still greater than 1.

2. **If `array[mid] > find`:**
   - `r` is updated to `mid`.
   - The new value of `r` could be such that `r - l` is still greater than 1.

In both cases, the only variables that affect the loop condition `r - l > 1` are `l` and `r`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `r - l > 1` holds true after the last iteration.

Given the conditions:
- `n` (the length of the array) is greater than 1.
- `l` and `r` are updated based on the comparison of `array[mid]` with `find`.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `r - l` must be greater than 1. Since the exact values of `l` and `r` are not specified, we can only ensure that the difference between `r` and `l` remains greater than 1.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `l` and `r` such that `r - l > 1`.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` and `n` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` must satisfy `r - l > 1`**
