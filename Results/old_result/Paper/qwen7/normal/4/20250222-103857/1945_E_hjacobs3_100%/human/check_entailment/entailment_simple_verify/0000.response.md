### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find.
- We need to rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps so that after performing a binary search, `p[l]` (where `l` is the final index after the binary search loop) is equal to `x`.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Main Loop:**
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   while t > 0:
       (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
       array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
       res = func_1(array, x)
       if res:
           print(' '.join(res))
       t -= 1
   ```
   - This part reads the input and calls the `func_1` function to determine the necessary swaps.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(array, find):
       n = len(array)
       l, r = 0, n
       while r - l > 1:
           mid = (l + r) // 2
           if array[mid] <= find:
               l = mid
           else:
               r = mid
       if (l != array.index(find)):
           print(1)
           return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
       else:
           print(0)
   ```
   - The function performs a binary search on the array.
   - After the binary search loop, it checks if `array[l]` is not equal to `find`.
   - If `array[l]` is not equal to `find`, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped.
   - If `array[l]` is equal to `find`, it prints `0`.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The function correctly performs the binary search and identifies the position `l` where the search ends.
- The check `if (l != array.index(find)):` is flawed because it assumes that `array[l]` should be equal to `find` after the binary search, which is not necessarily true. The binary search only narrows down the range where `find` could be located, but it doesn't guarantee that `array[l]` will be exactly `find`.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
Consider the example test case provided:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5 3
  5 4 3 2 1
  ```
- Expected output:
  ```
  2
  4 5
  1 4
  ```

- Actual output:
  ```
  0
  ```

- Explanation:
  - The binary search finds that `array[2]` (index 2) is `3`, but it does not perform any swaps because `array[2]` is already `3`.
  - However, according to the problem, we need to ensure that `p[l]` (after the binary search) is `3`. Since `3` is not at the correct position, we need to swap `3` with another element to place it at the correct position.

#### Correct Approach:
- The function should identify the correct positions to swap to ensure `array[l]` becomes `find`.
- The current implementation only checks if `array[l]` is not equal to `find` and performs a swap, which is insufficient.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. It fails to ensure that `p[l]` is equal to `x` after the binary search, even though it might find the correct position through the binary search process.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
