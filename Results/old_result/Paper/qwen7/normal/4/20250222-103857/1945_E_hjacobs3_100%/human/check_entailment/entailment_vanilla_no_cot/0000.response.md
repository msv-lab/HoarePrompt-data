Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the binary search is not being applied to the permutation before performing the swaps. Instead, the program attempts to perform swaps based on the result of a binary search run on the original permutation, which is not the intended approach.

The correct approach should involve rearranging the permutation such that `p_l` equals `x` after the binary search, and then performing the binary search on the rearranged permutation. The provided code does not rearrange the permutation; it only checks if the element at the midpoint of the current search range matches `x`, which is not sufficient for solving the problem as stated.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    
    # Find the index of x in the permutation
    index_x = array.index(x)
    
    # Initialize the number of operations
    num_operations = 0
    
    # Perform at most 2 operations to ensure p_l == x
    if index_x != 0:
        # Swap with the first element
        array[index_x], array[0] = array[0], array[index_x]
        num_operations += 1
        index_x = 0
    
    if index_x != n-1:
        # Swap with the last element
        array[index_x], array[n-1] = array[n-1], array[index_x]
        num_operations += 1
    
    # Perform binary search on the rearranged array
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= x:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    # Output the number of operations and the swaps performed
    print(num_operations)
    if num_operations >= 1:
        print(f"{index_x + 1} {0 + 1}")
    if num_operations >= 2:
        print(f"{n - 1 + 1} {index_x + 1}")
    
    t -= 1
```

This corrected version ensures that the permutation is rearranged such that the element `x` is at the start of the array before performing the binary search, and it outputs the necessary swaps.
