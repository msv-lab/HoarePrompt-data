Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n and n must be greater than 1; `mid` is (l + r) // 2; `r` is mid.**

The value at index `mid` in `array` is greater than `find`, but the code only updates the value of `r` to be equal to `mid`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
