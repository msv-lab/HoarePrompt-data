Output: **0**

Explanation: The initial state tells us that `l` will be equal to `r` minus one, and `l` is also equal to `array.index(find)`. This means `l` is set to the index of `find` in the list `array`. The value of `array[l]` is either less than or equal to `find` or greater than `find`, but this does not affect the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement simply outputs the integer `0`, regardless of the values of `l`, `r`, or `array`. Therefore, the output is **0**.
