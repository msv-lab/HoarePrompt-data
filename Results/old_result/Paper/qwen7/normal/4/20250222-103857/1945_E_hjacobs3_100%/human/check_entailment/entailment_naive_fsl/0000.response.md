Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not handle the case where the element `x` is not present in the array. According to the problem description, the goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation such that after performing the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`. However, the current implementation only checks if `array[l]` equals `x` and prints 1 operation if they are not equal, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
1
5 3
5 4 3 2 1
```
- Expected output:
```
2
4 5
1 4
```
- Actual output:
```
0
```

In this case, the element `3` is not at position `l` (which starts at 0), and the program does not perform any swaps to move `3` to position `l`. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirement of ensuring that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search.
