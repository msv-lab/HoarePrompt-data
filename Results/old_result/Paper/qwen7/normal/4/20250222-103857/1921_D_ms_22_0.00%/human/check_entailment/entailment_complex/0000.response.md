Reasoning:

The provided program aims to maximize the total difference \(D\) between the arrays \(a\) and \(c\), where \(c\) is constructed from the array \(b\). The approach taken in the program is correct. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads \(n\), \(m\), the array \(a\), and the array \(b\).

2. **Sorting and Heap Initialization**: The array \(b\) is sorted, and a max heap is initialized to keep track of the maximum differences between elements of \(a\) and the boundaries of \(b\).

3. **Heap Operations**: For each element in \(a\), the program calculates the difference with the smallest and largest elements in \(b\). It pushes the larger of these differences into the max heap along with the corresponding index in \(b\).

4. **Processing the Max Heap**: The program processes the max heap to ensure that the differences are applied to the correct elements in \(b\) (either the smallest or largest remaining elements). This ensures that the differences are maximized.

5. **Updating Indices**: The program updates the indices `tp1` and `tp2` to ensure that the differences are applied to the correct elements in \(b\).

6. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total difference \(D\).

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the total difference \(D\).

Correctness: **True**
