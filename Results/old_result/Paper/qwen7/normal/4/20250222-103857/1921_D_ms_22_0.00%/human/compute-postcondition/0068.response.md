Output State: **`max_heap` is non-empty, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap` using `heapq.heappop`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`**.

This means that the `max_heap` remains non-empty, and the `item` which was the highest value item removed from the heap is still referenced. A new variable `diff1` has been introduced and is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `item[1]` (the second element of the `item` tuple) and `b[tp1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
