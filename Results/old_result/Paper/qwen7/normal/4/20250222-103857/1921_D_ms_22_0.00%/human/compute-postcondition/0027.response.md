Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, and a max heap contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`**.

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` onto a max heap using `heapq.heappush`. The tuple consists of the negative of `diff1`, the value of `i`, and the integer `0`. Since the heap is a max heap, the tuple is added such that the maximum value (based on the first element of the tuple) is at the top. The values of `a`, `i`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged.
