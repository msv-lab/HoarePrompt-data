Output State: **`max_heap` is empty, `ans` contains the total accumulated value based on the specified rules, `tp1` and `tp2` are adjusted accordingly until they cover the entire range of indices in `b`, `n` is an integer obtained from `map(int, input().split())[0]`, `m` is an integer obtained from `map(int, input().split())[1]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())`, `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())**.

Explanation: The code `b.sort()` sorts the list `b` in ascending order. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the list `b` is updated to be sorted, while the other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
