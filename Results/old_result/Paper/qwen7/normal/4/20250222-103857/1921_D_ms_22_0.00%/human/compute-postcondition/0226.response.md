Output State: **`i` is the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `b`; `diff1` is `i`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the element at index `m-1` of `b`; `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` onto a min heap called `max_heap`. The values of `i`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new information introduced is the presence of the tuple in the `max_heap`.
