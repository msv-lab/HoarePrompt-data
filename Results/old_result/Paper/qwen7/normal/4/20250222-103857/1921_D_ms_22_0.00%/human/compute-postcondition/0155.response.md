Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0], `max_heap` does not contain the tuple that was popped, and `item` is a tuple of the form (-diff, i, index) where -diff is the highest difference found, i is the element from list `a` that corresponds to this difference, and index is either 0 or `m-1`. Additionally, the third element of `item` (index) is not less than `tp1` and not greater than `tp2`.**

In this step, the value of `ans` is updated by adding `-item[0]` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state, with the condition on the third element of `item` still holding true.
