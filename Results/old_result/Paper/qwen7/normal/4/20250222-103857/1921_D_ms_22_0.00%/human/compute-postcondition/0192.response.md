Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`; `ans` is increased by either `diff1` or `diff2` depending on the condition `diff1 > diff2`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `ans` is increased by `diff1` and `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `diff2`.
