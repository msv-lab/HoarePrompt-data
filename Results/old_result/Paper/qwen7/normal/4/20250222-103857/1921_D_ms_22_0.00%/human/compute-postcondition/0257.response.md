Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0]; `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `tp2` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `tp2 -= 1` decreases the value of `tp2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
