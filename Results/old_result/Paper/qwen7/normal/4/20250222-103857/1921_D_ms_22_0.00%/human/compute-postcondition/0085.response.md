Output State: **`max_heap` is a heap without the item that was previously its maximum, `item` is the maximum element that was removed from `max_heap`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`**.

This means that the `max_heap` has lost its maximum element which is stored in the `item` variable. The `diff1` variable now holds the absolute difference between the second element of the `item` tuple (denoted as `item[1]`) and the element `b[tp1]`.
