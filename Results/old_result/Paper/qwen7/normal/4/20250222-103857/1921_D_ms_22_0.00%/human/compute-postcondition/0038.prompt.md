Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` is the first integer input split from input().split(), `m` is the second integer input split from input().split(), `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order obtained by splitting the next input and converting each element to an integer, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
    diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])
    if diff1 > diff2:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))
    else:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, a tuple (`-diff1`, `i`, 0) is pushed into the max heap. Otherwise, a tuple (`-diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`) is pushed into the max heap.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, then a max heap contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`. Otherwise, a max heap contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the next element in `a`, `diff1` and `diff2` are recalculated as `abs(i - b[0])` and `abs(i - b[m - 1])` respectively. Depending on whether `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, either a tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` is pushed into `max_heap` or a max heap with one element `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` is created.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
