Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the tuple that was popped, and `item` is a tuple of the form (-diff, i, index) where -diff is the highest difference found, i is the element from list `a` that corresponds to this difference, and index is either 0 or `m-1`. If the current value of `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `ans` is increased by either `diff1` or `diff2`, depending on which is greater, and either `tp1` is increased by 1 or `tp2` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `-item[0]`, and either `tp1` is increased by 1 if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, or `tp2` is decreased by 1.
