Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` is the first integer input split from input().split(), `m` is the second integer input split from input().split(), `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order obtained by splitting the next input and converting each element to an integer, `max_heap` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `max_heap`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, their values remain as described in the initial state.
