Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, meaning that every element in the list `a` has been processed. For each element `i` in `a`, the differences `diff1` (absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`) and `diff2` (absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`) were calculated. Based on these differences, tuples of the form `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` were pushed into the `max_heap`. After processing all elements in `a`, `max_heap` will contain up to `len(a)` such tuples, each representing the maximum difference found for each element in `a` with respect to the boundaries of `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.

The final state of the variables is as follows:
- `t`: A positive integer less than its original value by the number of iterations (length of `a`).
- `n`: Unchanged, the input integer.
- `m`: Unchanged, the input integer.
- `a`: Unchanged, the list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `b`: Unchanged, the list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.
- `max_heap`: Contains up to `len(a)` tuples of the form `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, where `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.
- `tp1`: Remains 0.
- `tp2`: Remains `m - 1`.
- `ans`: Remains 0.
