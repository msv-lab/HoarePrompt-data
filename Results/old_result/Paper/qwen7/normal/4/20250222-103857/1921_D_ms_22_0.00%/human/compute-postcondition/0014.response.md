Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `diff2` as the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of list `b`. The value of `diff1` remains unchanged, and the list `a` and the variable `i` remain unaffected.
