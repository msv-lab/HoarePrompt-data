Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the tuple that was popped, and `item` is a tuple of the form (-diff, i, index) where -diff is the highest difference found, i is the element from list `a` that corresponds to this difference, and index is either 0 or `m-1`. The current value of `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`; `ans` is increased by either `diff1` or `diff2` depending on whether `diff1` is greater than `diff2`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.
