To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop head. The loop condition is `max_heap`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `max_heap` is not empty.
2. **Current State**: 
   - `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped.
   - `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was popped.
   - `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`.
   - `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`.
   - `tp1` is incremented by 1.
   - `ans` is increased by either `diff1` (if `diff1 > diff2`) or `diff2` (if `diff1 <= diff2`).
   - If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `ans` is further decreased by 1.

### Required Adjustments:

For the loop to continue executing, `max_heap` must not be empty. Since the loop condition is `max_heap`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `max_heap` is not empty.

### Final Answer:

State: **`max_heap` is not empty**
