Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the tuple that was popped, and `item` is a tuple of the form (-diff, i, index) where -diff is the highest difference found, i is the element from list `a` that corresponds to this difference, and index is either 0 or `m-1`. The current value of `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `item[1]` (which is an element from list `a`) and `b[tp1]` and assigns it to `diff1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
