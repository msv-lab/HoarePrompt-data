Postcondition: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `ans` is increased by either `-item[0]`, `diff1`, or `diff2`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1` (where `diff1` is greater than `diff2`), or `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.**
