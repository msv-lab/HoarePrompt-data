Postcondition: `ans` is increased by -item[0], `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the maximum element from `max_heap` before it was modified to maintain the max-heap property. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, which is 1, then no additional change is made to `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` is decreased by 1.
