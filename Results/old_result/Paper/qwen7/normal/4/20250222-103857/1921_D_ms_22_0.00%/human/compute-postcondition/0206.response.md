Output State: **`t` is a positive integer less than the original value of `t` by 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting list of integers is stored in the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
