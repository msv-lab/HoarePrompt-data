Output State: **`t` is a positive integer less than the original value of `t` by 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state, except that `a` is now updated to reflect the new list `b`.
