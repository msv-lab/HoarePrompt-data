Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements; `diff1` is the absolute difference between the new `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b` and assigns it to `diff2`. The values of `a` and `diff1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
