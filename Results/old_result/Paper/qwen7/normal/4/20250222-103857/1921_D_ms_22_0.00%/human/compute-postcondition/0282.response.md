Output State: **`ans` is incremented by `diff1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is the maximum element from `max_heap` before it was modified to maintain the max-heap property, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += diff1` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `diff1`. The other variables (`tp1`, `diff1`, `max_heap`, `item`, and `diff2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
