Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `ans` is increased by -item[0]**.

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by `-item[0]`, which means `ans` is decreased by the value of `item[0]`. The `max_heap` and `item` remain unchanged from their initial state.
