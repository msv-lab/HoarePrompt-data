Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `i` is the next element in the list `a` after the last processed element, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the new `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the new `i` and the last element of `b`, `max_heap` is a heap containing either (`-diff1`, `i`, 0) if `diff1 > diff2` or (`-diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`) if `diff1 <= diff2`, `diff1` is updated to the absolute difference between the new `i` and the first element of `b`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `diff1` to the absolute difference between the current value of `i` and the first element of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
