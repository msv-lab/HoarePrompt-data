Postcondition: `max_heap` is non-empty, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap` using `heapq.heappop`, the third element of `item` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2 - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the original value of `ans` and the minimum of `diff1` and `diff2`, where `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2 - 1]`.
