Output State: **`ans` is increased by `diff2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the maximum element from `max_heap` before it was modified to maintain the max-heap property; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, and `tp2` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += diff2` adds the value of `diff2` to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged. `diff1` and `tp2` are not affected by this operation.
