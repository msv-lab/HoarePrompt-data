The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `max_heap` is empty, `ans` contains the total accumulated value, and both `tp1` and `tp2` are adjusted accordingly. For the loop to be executed one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`max_heap` is empty, `ans` contains the total accumulated value based on the specified rules, and both `tp1` and `tp2` are adjusted accordingly until they cover the entire range of indices in `b`, and `t` must be greater than 0**
