Postcondition: `max_heap` is a heap without the item that was previously its maximum, `item` is the maximum element that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by the value of `-item[0]`, and either `tp1` is increased by 1 or `tp2` is decreased by 1 depending on the condition `item[2] == tp1`.
