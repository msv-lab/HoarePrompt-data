Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the tuple that was popped, and `item` is a tuple of the form (-diff, i, index) where -diff is the highest difference found, i is the element from list `a` that corresponds to this difference, and index is either 0 or `m-1`.**

This means that the `max_heap` no longer contains the tuple that was popped, and a new variable `item` has been assigned the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, which includes the maximum difference (`-diff`), the corresponding element from list `a` (`i`), and the index (`index`) which is either `0` or `m-1`.
