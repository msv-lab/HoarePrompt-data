Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `max_heap` will contain tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` where `i` is an element from list `a`, `index` is either `0` or `m-1`, and `diff` is the absolute difference between `i` and either the first (`b[0]`) or last (`b[m-1]`) element of list `b`. The tuples are pushed into `max_heap` based on which difference (`diff1` or `diff2`) is larger during each iteration.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `max_heap` is non-empty, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap` using `heapq.heappop`. If the third element of `item` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2 - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the original value of `ans` and the maximum of `diff1` and `diff2`, where `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2 - 1]`. If the third element of `item` is equal to `tp1` or between `tp1` and `tp2` exclusive (not inclusive), `ans` is increased by `-item[0]`, and if `item[2]` is `tp1 + 1`, then `tp2` remains unchanged; otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `max_heap` is non-empty, `ans` is increased by either `diff1` (if `diff1 > diff2`) or `diff2` (if `diff1 <= diff2`), `diff1` is updated to the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` (if `diff1 > diff2`), `diff2` is updated to the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` (if `diff1 <= diff2`), `tp1` is incremented by 1 (if `diff1 > diff2`), `tp2` is decreased by 1 (if `diff1 <= diff2`), or `ans` is increased by the value `-item[0]`. If `item[2] == tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `max_heap` is a heap without the item that was previously its maximum, `item` is the maximum element that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is updated based on the following conditions: if `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then `ans` is updated according to the differences between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` or `b[tp2]`; otherwise, `ans` is increased by `-item[0]`, and either `tp1` is incremented by 1 or `tp2` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
