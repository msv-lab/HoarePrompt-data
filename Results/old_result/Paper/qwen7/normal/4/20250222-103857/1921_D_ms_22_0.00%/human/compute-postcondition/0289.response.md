Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0] - 1, `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the maximum element from `max_heap` before it was modified to maintain the max-heap property.**

Explanation: The variable `tp2` is decremented by 1. Since `tp2` was previously the item that was popped from `max_heap` and `item` was the maximum element before it was modified to maintain the max-heap property, `ans` was increased by `-item[0]`. Now, `tp2` is effectively `item[0] - 1`, so `ans` is now increased by `-item[0] - 1`. The state of `max_heap` and `item` remains unchanged.
