Output State: **`max_heap` is non-empty, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap` using `heapq.heappop`, `item[2]` is equal to `tp1 + 1`, `ans` is increased by -`item[0]`.**

Explanation: The value of `tp1` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `item[2]` is updated to `tp1 + 1`. The value of `ans` is still increased by `-item[0]`, but the exact value of `ans` is not specified since it depends on the initial value of `item[0]`.
