Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 99, `n` is the first integer input split from input().split(), `m` is the second integer input split from input().split(), `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes the next input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. This new list of integers is assigned to `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
