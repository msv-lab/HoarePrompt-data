Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was popped; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2 - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `tp2 -= 1` decrements the value of `tp2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state of `diff2` reflects the new index `tp2 - 1`.
