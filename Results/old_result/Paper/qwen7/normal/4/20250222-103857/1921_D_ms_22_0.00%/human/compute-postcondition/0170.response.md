Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was popped; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`; `tp1` is incremented by 1.**

The code `tp1 += 1` increments the value of `tp1` by 1. No other changes are made to the variables `max_heap`, `item`, `diff1`, `diff2`, or `b`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and only `tp1` is updated.
