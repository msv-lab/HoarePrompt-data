The loop head is `while max_heap:`. This means the loop continues as long as `max_heap` is not empty.

To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the condition under which the loop continues. The loop will continue to execute as long as `max_heap` is non-empty.

Given the postcondition and the loop head, no adjustments are needed to the variables `item`, `ans`, `diff1`, `diff2`, `tp1`, `tp2`, or `m` because these variables are not part of the loop head condition. The only variable that affects the loop's continuation is `max_heap`.

Since the loop will continue to execute as long as `max_heap` is non-empty, we need to ensure that `max_heap` is not empty for the next iteration.

**State: **`max_heap` must not be empty**
