Output State: **`t` is a positive integer less than the original value of `t` by 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`**.

Explanation: The code `b.sort()` sorts the list `b` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` retain their initial conditions except that `b` is now sorted.
