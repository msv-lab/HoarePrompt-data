Postcondition: **`i` is the next element in the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the current `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the current `i` and the last element of `b`, and `max_heap` contains either the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2`, or the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1 <= diff2`.**
