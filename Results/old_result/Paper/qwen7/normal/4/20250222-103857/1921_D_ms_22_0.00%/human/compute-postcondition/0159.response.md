Postcondition: `ans` is increased by -item[0], `max_heap` does not contain the tuple that was popped, and `item` is a tuple of the form (-diff, i, index) where -diff is the highest difference found, i is the element from list `a` that corresponds to this difference, and index is either 0 or `m-1`. Additionally, the third element of `item` (index) is not less than `tp1` and not greater than `tp2`, and `item[2]` is not equal to `tp1`.
