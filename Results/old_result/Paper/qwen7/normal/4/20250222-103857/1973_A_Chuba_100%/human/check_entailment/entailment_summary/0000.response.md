Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
2. For each test case, the program checks if the sum of the scores \(p_1 + p_2 + p_3\) is odd. If it is, the program prints \(-1\), which is correct because an odd sum cannot be achieved through the scoring system (since each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points distributed between two players).
3. If the sum is even, the program calculates the number of draws using the formula \((v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2\). This formula is derived from the fact that each draw contributes 1 point to each of the two players involved, and the difference in points between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores helps to determine the maximum possible number of draws.

However, the formula used in the program might not always yield the correct maximum number of draws. Specifically, the formula \((v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2\) does not account for the possibility of games ending in a win/loss scenario, which would contribute 2 points to one player and 0 to the other. Therefore, the calculation might overestimate the number of draws.

To illustrate, consider the test case \(1, 1, 2\):
- The sum is \(1 + 1 + 2 = 4\) (even), so we should calculate the number of draws.
- The formula gives \((1 + 1 + 2 - \max(0, 2 - 1 - 1)) // 2 = (4 - 0) // 2 = 2\).
- However, the correct number of draws is 2, as explained by the example in the problem statement.

Given this analysis, the program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
