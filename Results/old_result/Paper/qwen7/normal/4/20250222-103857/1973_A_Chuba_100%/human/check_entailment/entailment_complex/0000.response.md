Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is consistent with the problem statement.

2. **Input Validation**: The program checks if the sum of the scores (`v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`) is odd. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`, which is correct because an odd sum cannot be achieved through the given scoring system (since each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points in total).

3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**: The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[1] - v[0]))}{2}
   \]
   This formula is derived from the fact that each draw contributes 2 points in total, and the expression inside the parentheses adjusts for the minimum score difference between the players to ensure a valid distribution of points.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when no games are played (all scores are 0) and when the scores are inconsistent (sum is odd).

5. **Loop and Variable State**: The loop iterates over all test cases, and after processing, the state of the variables is consistent with the problem constraints.

Given the above analysis, the program logic and handling of the problem constraints are correct.

Correctness: **True**
