### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the scores `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` and stores them in a list `v`.

2. **Score Sum Check:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is even. This is necessary because the total points must be even since each game contributes either 2 points (to the winner) or 2 points in total (1 point each in a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, the function prints `-1` immediately, which is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws:**
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
     \]
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`: Total points scored by all three players.
     - `v[2] - v[0] - v[1]`: The difference in points between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])`: Ensures that we do not subtract a negative value, which would make the numerator invalid.
     - Dividing by 2 gives the maximum number of draws because each draw adds 2 points to the total score (1 point to each player).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the sum of scores is odd correctly by printing `-1`.
   - However, the formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws does not account for the fact that the scores must be achievable through a combination of wins and draws. Specifically, the formula assumes that the maximum number of draws can be calculated directly from the scores without considering the constraints of the game dynamics.

### Detailed Analysis:

Let's consider the example `1 1 2`:
- According to the formula, the calculation would be:
  \[
  \text{result} = \frac{(1 + 1 + 2 - \max(0, 2 - 1 - 1))}{2} = \frac{4 - 0}{2} = 2
  \]
- This suggests that 2 draws could have occurred, but in reality, the only way to achieve these scores is with one win and one draw:
  - Player 1 wins against Player 2 (Player 1 gets 2 points, Player 2 gets 0 points).
  - Player 1 draws with Player 3 (Player 1 gets 1 point, Player 3 gets 1 point).
  - Player 2 draws with Player 3 (Player 2 gets 1 point, Player 3 gets 1 point).

Thus, the maximum number of draws is actually 1, not 2.

### Conclusion:

The program logic has a flaw in the formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws. The formula does not correctly account for the constraints of the game dynamics, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not accurately determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores.
