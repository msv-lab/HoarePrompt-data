Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `v` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers using map and int.**

Explanation: The code `v = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a user input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and then creates a list from these integers. The initial conditions for `t` and the nature of `v` (a list of integers) are preserved, but now `v` is specifically a list of integers derived from the user input.
