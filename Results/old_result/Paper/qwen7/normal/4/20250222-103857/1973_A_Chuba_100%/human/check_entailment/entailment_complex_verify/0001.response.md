### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the scores `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` and stores them in a list `v`.

2. **Score Sum Check:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is even. This is necessary because the total points must be even since each game contributes either 2 points (to the winner) or 2 points in total (1 point each in a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, the function prints `-1` immediately, which is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws:**
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
     \]
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`: Total points scored by all three players.
     - `v[2] - v[0] - v[1]`: The difference in points between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])`: Ensures that we do not subtract a negative value, which would make the numerator invalid.
     - Dividing by 2 gives the maximum number of draws because each draw adds 2 points to the total score (1 point to each player).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the sum of scores is odd correctly by printing `-1`.
   - However, the formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is incorrect. Specifically, the term `v[2] - v[0] - v[1]` does not accurately represent the number of draws. Instead, it represents the excess points that the highest scorer has over the sum of the other two scores, which can be negative or zero but does not directly correspond to the number of draws.

To illustrate, consider the following example:
- Input: `1 1 2`
- Expected output: `2`
- Actual output: `-1`

In this case, the scores can be achieved with 2 draws (one between players 1 and 2, and another between players 1 and 3). However, the program incorrectly prints `-1`.

### Correct Calculation:
The correct approach to calculate the maximum number of draws is to use the following formula:
\[
\text{draws} = \frac{(v[2] - v[1]) + (v[2] - v[0])}{2}
\]
This formula ensures that we account for the points that need to be balanced out by draws.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the provided formula for calculating the maximum number of draws is incorrect. The program fails to handle some valid cases correctly.

### Final:
**False**
