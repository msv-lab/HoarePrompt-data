Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `v` is a list of integers converted from input integers.**

Explanation: The code `v = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `v`. The initial state of `t` being greater than 1 and `v` being a list of integers remains unchanged except that `v` now contains integers instead of potentially being an empty list or retaining its previous integer values.
