Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), after executing the code, `t` will still be within this range, and it will be the integer value entered by the user.
