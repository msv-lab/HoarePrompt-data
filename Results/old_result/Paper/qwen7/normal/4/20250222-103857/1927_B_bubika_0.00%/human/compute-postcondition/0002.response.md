Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `t` which is being iterated over using `range(int(input()))`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `t`**: The initial value of `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Understand the Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is within the specified range. The value of `t` is determined by `int(input())`, which means the user will input a value for `t` each time the loop runs.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop will execute based on the user input for `t`, the initial state of `t` must be within the valid range for the loop to execute at least once. Therefore, `t` should be set to the minimum value in the range, which is 1, to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

5. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. They remain unchanged from their initial states.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` being set to 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is 1, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `b` is a list of 26 zeros**
