Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `s`.
   - `i` is the next element in the list `s`.
   - `s` is the list of integers.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `r` is a string with the character `a[x]` appended twice.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `b` is the count of how many times each character (represented by its index) appeared in the list `s` with the count at index `x` incremented by 1.
   - `t` is 2.
   - `s` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `i` is the next element in the list `s`.
   - `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`.
   - `b[x]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `s`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be the next element in the list `s`.
   - `x` will be the index of `i` in the list `b`.
   - `b[x]` will be incremented by 1.

5. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in the list `s`, and `s` is a non-empty list, `i` will be the first element of `s` for the next iteration.
   - `x` will be the index of `i` in the list `b`.
   - `b[x]` will be incremented by 1.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`r` is a string with the character `a[x]` appended twice, `n` is an input integer, `b` is the count of how many times each character (represented by its index) appeared in the list `s` with the count at index `x` incremented by 1, `t` is 2, `s` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element being `i`, `i` is the first element of `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`, `b[x]` is incremented by 1.**
