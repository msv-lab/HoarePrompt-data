Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `a` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**.

The code assigns the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` to the variable `a`. This changes the value of `a` from a list of non-negative integers to a string. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
