Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

# Annotated Functions:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
    #The program returns True if the string 's' is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward), otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters and returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward), otherwise it returns `False`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, and n is the length of the string s such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_2():
    s = input()
    n, x = len(s), -1
    if (func_1(s[0:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(s)
        #This is printed: s (where s is the input string)
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `s` is an input string, `n` is the length of the input string `s`, `x` is -1, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is either -1 or the index where the first non-matching character is found (if such an index exists), and the loop has executed `n-1` times.
    if (x == -1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program does not return any value
    #State: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is either -1 or the index where the first non-matching character is found (if such an index exists), and the loop has executed `n-1` times. Additionally, the condition `x != -1` holds true.
    if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
        #This is printed: s[:x + 1] s[x + 1:]
    else :
        if (x == 1 or x == n // 2) :
            print('NO')
            #This is printed: 'NO'
        else :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(2)
            #This is printed: 2
            print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
            #This is printed: s[:x + 2] s[x + 2:] (where `x` is an index that is neither 1 nor `n // 2`)
        #State: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is either -1 or the index where the first non-matching character is found (if such an index exists), and the loop has executed `n-1` times. Additionally, the condition `func_1(s[x + 1:]) == True` holds true. **Regardless of whether the condition `x == 1 or x == n // 2` is met, the value of `x` will be either 1, `n // 2`, or neither of these values, while still satisfying the other conditions.**
    #State: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is either -1 or the index where the first non-matching character is found (if such an index exists), and the loop has executed `n-1` times. Additionally, the condition `x != -1` holds true. Furthermore, if `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`, `x` remains unchanged. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`, `x` is set to either 1, `n // 2`, or left as -1, ensuring it still satisfies the condition `x != -1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an input string `s` and determines whether certain conditions are met based on the string's characters. If the first character of the string is not repeated elsewhere in the string or if specific conditions related to the index `x` are satisfied, it prints 'YES' followed by either 1 or 2 along with relevant substrings. If none of the conditions are met, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
