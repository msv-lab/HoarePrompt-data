Functionality: **The function processes an input string `s` and determines whether certain conditions are met based on the string's characters. If the first character of the string is not repeated elsewhere in the string or if specific conditions related to the index `x` are satisfied, it prints 'YES' followed by either 1 or 2 along with relevant substrings. If none of the conditions are met, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.**
