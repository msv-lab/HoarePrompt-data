### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to check if a given string can be partitioned into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes.
   - The provided code attempts to solve this problem by checking specific conditions to determine if a valid partition exists.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a string is a palindrome.
   - It correctly returns `True` if the string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function starts by reading the input string `s`.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`. If it is, it prints "YES", "1", and `s`, indicating that the string itself is a valid partition.
   - If the string is not a palindrome, it iterates through the string to find the first character that is different from the first character (`s[0]`).
   - If no such character is found (`x == -1`), it prints "NO", indicating that no valid partition exists.
   - If a non-matching character is found at index `x`, it further checks if the substring starting from `x+1` is a palindrome.
     - If it is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", "2", and the two partitions.
     - If it is a palindrome, it checks if `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`. If so, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES", "2", and the two partitions.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where the entire string is a palindrome correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the string is not a palindrome and finds a valid partition.
   - The logic for checking the middle character (`x == 1` or `x == n // 2`) ensures that the partition is valid.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic of the function is sound and correctly implements the required behavior based on the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and outputs the appropriate results.

### Correctness:
**True**
