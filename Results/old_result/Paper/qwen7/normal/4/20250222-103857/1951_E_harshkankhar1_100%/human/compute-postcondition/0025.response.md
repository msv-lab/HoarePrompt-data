Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is either -1 or the index where the first non-matching character is found (if such an index exists), and the loop has executed `n-1` times.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the string `s` (`n`). The variable `x` will either remain `-1` if no character in the string `s` (except the first one) matches the first character, or it will be set to the index of the first character that does not match the first character of the string `s`. The loop will have completed `n-1` iterations, as it starts from `i=1` and increments `i` until it reaches `n`.
