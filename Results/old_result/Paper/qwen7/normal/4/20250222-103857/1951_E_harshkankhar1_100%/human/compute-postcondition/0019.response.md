Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, the character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the first character of string `s`, and `x` is 2. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the first character of string `s`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
