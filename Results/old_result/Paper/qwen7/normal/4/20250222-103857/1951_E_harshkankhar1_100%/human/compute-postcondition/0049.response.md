Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is either -1 or the index where the first non-matching character is found (if such an index exists), and the loop has executed `n-1` times. Additionally, the condition `x != -1` holds true. Regardless of whether `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True` or `False`, the value of `x` will be either 1, `n // 2`, or neither of these values, while still satisfying the other conditions.
