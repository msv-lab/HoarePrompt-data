Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 2; the character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the first character of string `s`; `x` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Since no such loop or conditional block is mentioned in the code, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
