Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if a string is a palindrome, which is not needed for the solution. Instead, the program should focus on partitioning the string into non-palindromic substrings.

2. **Function `func_2`**: 
   - The function reads input from `input()`, which is not appropriate for this context since the input is expected to be provided through standard input or a predefined list of test cases.
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed:
     - It checks if the entire string is not a palindrome and prints "YES" with a single-partition solution if true. However, this approach only works for strings like "sinktheyacht" where the entire string is non-palindromic.
     - The loop that tries to find a non-matching character to split the string is incorrect because it only considers the first non-matching character and splits the string at that point. This might not always result in a valid partition.
     - The handling of cases where the string can be split into non-palindromic substrings is incomplete and incorrect.

3. **Handling of Multiple Test Cases**: The program does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement. It only processes one string at a time.

4. **Output Format**: The program does not follow the required output format for multiple test cases. It should process each test case separately and print the results accordingly.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Read all test cases from the input.
- For each test case, check if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
- Print the appropriate output for each test case following the specified format.
