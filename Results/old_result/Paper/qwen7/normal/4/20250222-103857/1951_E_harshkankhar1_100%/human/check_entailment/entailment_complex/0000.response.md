Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to check if a string can be partitioned into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes. The given solution attempts to solve this by checking if the string can be split into two parts where at least one part is not a palindrome.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1(s)`**: This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome. It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - **Function `func_2()`**: This function processes the input string `s` and tries to find a way to split it into two non-palindromic parts. It uses the result of `func_1(s[0:])` to decide how to proceed.

3. **Function `func_2()` Logic**:
   - If the first character of the string is not a palindrome (`func_1(s[0:]) == False`), it directly prints "YES" and outputs the entire string as one part.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through the string to find the first character that is different from the first character. If such a character is found, it splits the string at that point.
   - If no such character is found (i.e., the string is a palindrome), it prints "NO".
   - If the string is not a single-character palindrome, it further checks if the second half of the string starting from the found index is not a palindrome. Depending on the result, it prints "YES" and splits the string accordingly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the string itself is a palindrome.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the string can be split into two non-palindromic parts.
   - The function logic ensures that the output format matches the problem requirements.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The function `func_2()` correctly implements the logic to determine if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - The function handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
