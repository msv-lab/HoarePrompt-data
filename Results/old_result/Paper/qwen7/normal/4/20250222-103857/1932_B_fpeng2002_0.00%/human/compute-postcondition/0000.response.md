Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `num_tests = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `num_tests`. This integer represents the number of test cases. Since the input is an integer within the range 1 to 1000 (inclusive), `num_tests` is set to this value. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
