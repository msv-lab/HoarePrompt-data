Output State: **`x` is `len(nums)`, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, `num_tests` is `num_tests - 2`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `start_year` to `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. Here, `x` is already defined as `len(nums)`, so the updated value of `start_year` is calculated using `nums[len(nums)]`. The other variables (`x`, `num_tests`, `nums`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
