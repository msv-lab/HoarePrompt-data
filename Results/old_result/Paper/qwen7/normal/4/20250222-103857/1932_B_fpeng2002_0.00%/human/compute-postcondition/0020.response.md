Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `x` and `nums`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `x` is the loop variable, and it starts from 0 and goes up to `len(nums) - 1`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `x < len(nums)`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `x` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the initial value of `x` should be 0.
   - The list `nums` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute at least once. If `nums` is empty, the loop will not run.

Given this analysis, we need to ensure that:
- `x` is initially set to 0.
- `nums` is a non-empty list.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`x` is 0, `nums` is a non-empty list of integers**.
