Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to calculate the year when the nth sign of the apocalypse will occur based on the periodicity of each sign. The logic used in the program is to iteratively update the `start_year` based on the current year and the periodicity of each subsequent sign.

Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `num_tests` to read the number of test cases.
2. **Loop through Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `nums`.
3. **Calculate `start_year`**: The key part of the logic is the loop where it updates `start_year`:
   ```python
   start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
   ```
   This formula is intended to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`. However, this formula is not correctly implemented for the purpose of finding the next occurrence of the sign.

4. **Correct Approach**: To correctly find the next occurrence of the sign, we should use the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities seen so far. The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of the numbers in the set.

Given the problem description and the provided execution summary, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the LCM of the periodicities. Instead, it uses a formula that does not guarantee the correct result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not properly compute the year when the nth sign will occur.

Correctness: **False**
