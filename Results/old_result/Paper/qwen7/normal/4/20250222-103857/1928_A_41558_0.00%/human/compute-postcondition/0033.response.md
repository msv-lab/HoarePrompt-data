Postcondition: `a` is an integer from the input split, `b` is an integer from the input split, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3. If `a % 2 != 0` and `b % 2 != 0`, the conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `a / 2` does not equal `b` and `b / 2` does not equal `a`, the conditions also remain unchanged.
