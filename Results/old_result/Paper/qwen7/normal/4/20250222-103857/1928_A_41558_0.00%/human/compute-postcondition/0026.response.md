Output State: **`a` is an integer from the input split, `b` is an integer from the input split, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3**.

Explanation: The code `a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes user input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers, assigning them to `a` and `b` respectively. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged from their previous states.
