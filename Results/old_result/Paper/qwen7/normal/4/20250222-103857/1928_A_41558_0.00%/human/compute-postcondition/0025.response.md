Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `a` and `b` are the first and second integers entered, respectively, and they are assigned the values from the input split into integers.
   - If `a` is odd and `b` is odd, no changes are made to `a` and `b`.
   - Otherwise, if `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, no changes are made to `a` and `b`.
   - Otherwise, no changes are made to `a` and `b`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`.
   - This means the loop will run `n` times.

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is 2, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

5. **Final State:**
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged as no changes were made to them in the previous iteration based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `a` and `b` are the first and second integers entered, respectively.**
