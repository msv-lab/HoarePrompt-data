Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, two positive integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function determines and returns a specific value based on the relationship between a and b.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value of `t` and pairs of values `(a, b)`. The exact nature of the return value for each test case is not specified in the given information, but it implies that the function evaluates `a` and `b` for each test case and returns a result based on their relationship.
