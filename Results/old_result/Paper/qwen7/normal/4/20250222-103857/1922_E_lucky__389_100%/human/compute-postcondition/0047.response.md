Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `2 ** i <= x`.
2. **Current States**: 
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x` is 14.
3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition**: 
   - With `i` = 1 and `x` = 14, the condition `2 ** i <= x` becomes `2 ** 1 <= 14`, which simplifies to `2 <= 14`. This is true.
4. **Determine Next Iteration Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `2 ** i <= x` must still hold true at the start of the next iteration.
5. **Adjust States**:
   - Since `i` is incremented within the loop body (though not shown), let's assume `i` is incremented by 1 in the loop body.
   - After incrementing `i` by 1, the new value of `i` would be 2.
   - The new condition would be `2 ** 2 <= x`, which simplifies to `4 <= 14`. This is true.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be such that `2 ** i <= x` holds true.

Given that `x` is fixed at 14, the critical state to adjust is `i`.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `i` must be such that `2 ** i <= 14` holds true in the next iteration.
- The smallest `i` that satisfies this condition is 3 (since `2 ** 3 = 8` and `2 ** 4 = 16`).

Thus, `i` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

**Answer**:
State: **`i` must be at least 3**
