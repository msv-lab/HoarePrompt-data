Based on the initial state provided:

- `mx` is set to 10.
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `x` is 0.
- `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values `[5, 10, 9]`.
- `i` is 2.
- `ansv` is a list containing the values `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 9]`.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = len(subseq_lens) - 1`, meaning it runs for a total of 2 iterations because `len(subseq_lens)` is 3. After the loop completes, `i` is 2, and `ansv` contains the values `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 9]`.

The `print(len(ansv))` statement will print the length of the `ansv` list.

Output: **8**
