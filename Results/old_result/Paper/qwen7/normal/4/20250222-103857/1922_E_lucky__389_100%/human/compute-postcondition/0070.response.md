Output State: `mx` is 10, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values [5, 10, 9], `i` is 2, `ansv` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 9].

Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = len(subseq_lens) - 1`, which means it will run for a total of 2 iterations based on the given `subseq_lens` list (since `len(subseq_lens)` is 3, but the loop starts from 1). After 3 iterations as shown in the provided states, `i` is 2, indicating the loop has completed its execution. Therefore, `ansv` will contain the appended values from `subseq_lens` starting from index 1 to the end, which are [5, 5, 9]. The other variables (`mx`, `t`, `x`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
