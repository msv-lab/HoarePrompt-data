Output State: `i` is 10, `x` is 14.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as `2 ** i` is less than or equal to `x`. Given that `x` remains 14 and `i` keeps increasing, we need to find the point where `2 ** i` exceeds 14. 

- After 3 iterations, `i` is 5, and `2 ** 5 = 32`, which is greater than 14, so the loop stops.
- To determine the exact number of iterations, we calculate how many times `i` can be incremented before `2 ** i` becomes greater than 14.
- `2 ** 9 = 512`, which is much greater than 14, but `2 ** 8 = 256` is also too large. Checking smaller powers, `2 ** 7 = 128` is still too large, but `2 ** 6 = 64` is also too large. 
- `2 ** 5 = 32` is the first power of 2 that is greater than 14. Therefore, `i` will be incremented from 0 to 9 (10 times in total) before the condition `2 ** i <= x` fails when `i` is 10.
- Hence, after all iterations, `i` will be 10, and `x` will remain 14 since it is not modified within the loop.
