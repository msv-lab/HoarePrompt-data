Output State: **`i` is 11, `x` is 14 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify the values of the variables `i` and `x`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, we assume it breaks out of an implicit loop or conditional context.
