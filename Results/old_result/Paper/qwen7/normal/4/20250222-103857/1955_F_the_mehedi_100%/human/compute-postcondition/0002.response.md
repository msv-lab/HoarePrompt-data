Output State: **`a` is a list of integers entered by the user; `cnt` is 0**

The initial state indicates that `a` is a list of integers entered by the user. The code snippet initializes `cnt` to 0. Since no operations are performed on `a` or any other variables, the only change is that `cnt` is set to 0.
