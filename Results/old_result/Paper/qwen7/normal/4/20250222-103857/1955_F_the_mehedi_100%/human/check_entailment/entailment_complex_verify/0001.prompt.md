You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, p_i is a list of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, respectively, such that 0 ≤ p_i[0] + p_i[1] + p_i[2] + p_i[3] ≤ 200.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `cnt` is the sum of the floor division of each element in `a` by 2, repeated for the number of times specified by the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of four integers representing counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. It calculates a count based on specific conditions involving these integers and prints the result. Specifically, it increments a counter by 1 if certain conditions are met and then adds the floor division of each integer in the list by 2 to the counter. The function does not return any value but prints the final count for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the input for each test case as a list of four integers `[p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4]`, which represent the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s respectively.

2. **Objective**:
   - The goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins, which happens when the XOR of all remaining numbers is zero.
   - Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers is non-zero.

3. **Key Logic**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of times Bob can win by considering the parity (odd or even) of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s.
   - Specifically, it checks if `a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1`. If this condition is true, it increments `cnt` by 1.
   - It then adds the floor division of each count by 2 to `cnt`.

4. **Calculation of `cnt`**:
   - The logic for incrementing `cnt` by 1 when `a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1` is incorrect.
     - This condition does not directly relate to maximizing Bob's wins.
   - Adding `math.floor(x / 2)` for each count `x` also does not align with the problem requirements.
     - The problem requires determining the optimal sequence removal strategy to maximize Bob's wins, not simply summing up the counts divided by 2.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the optimal strategy for Eve to remove numbers such that Bob wins as many times as possible.
   - This involves understanding how removing specific numbers affects the overall XOR value of the sequence.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It incorrectly calculates the number of times Bob can win without properly considering the optimal sequence removal strategy.
