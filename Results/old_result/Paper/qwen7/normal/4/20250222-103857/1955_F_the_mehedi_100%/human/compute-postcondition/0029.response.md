Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means the loop will run based on the integer input provided by the user. The variables involved in the loop head are the input itself and the loop counter (which is represented by `_`).

2. **Determine the state adjustments**: Since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly named, we focus on the input value and the condition under which the loop runs. The loop will continue to execute as long as the input value is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `cnt` is increased by the floor division of each element in `a` by 2.

4. **Next iteration requirements**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the input value must be greater than 0.
   - The state of `a` and `cnt` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - The input value must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
   - The list `a` and the variable `cnt` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is increased by the floor division of each element in `a` by 2, and the input value must be greater than 0**.
