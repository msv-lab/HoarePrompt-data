Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:

1. The program incorrectly calculates the number of times Bob can win.
2. It does not consider the bitwise XOR operation or the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.
3. The logic inside the loop where `cnt` is incremented is flawed and does not reflect the game's rules or the objective of maximizing Bob's wins.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to focus on the bitwise XOR operation and how removing certain numbers can affect the outcome of the game. The solution should involve counting the parity of the counts of each type of number and using that to determine the optimal moves for Eve.
