Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `cnt` is the total sum of the floor division of each element in the list `a` by 2, plus one additional count if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s in the list `a` are all odd.

In Natural Language: After running the loop as many times as there are test cases (determined by `input()`), the variable `cnt` will hold a value equal to the sum of the floor division of each element in the list `a` by 2, plus one additional count if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s in the list `a` are all odd.
