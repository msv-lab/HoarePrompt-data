Output State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `k` is `j + 1`, either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` to be `j + 1`. Given that `j` is initially 0, `k` becomes 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `b` must still be greater than 0, `j` remains 0, `k` is now 1, and the condition that either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1` still holds.
