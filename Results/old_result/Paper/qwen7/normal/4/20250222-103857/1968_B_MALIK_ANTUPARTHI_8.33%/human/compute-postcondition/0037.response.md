Postcondition: `d` is a list, `j` is an index such that if `j < b - 1`, `j` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `j` remains `b - 1`. `k` is an index such that if `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`, `k` is set to the index where `d[j]` is found, or if `k == c`, `j + 1` is assigned to `k`. If `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, `k` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
