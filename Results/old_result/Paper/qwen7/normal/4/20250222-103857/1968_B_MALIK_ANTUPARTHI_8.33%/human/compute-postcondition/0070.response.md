Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, `a` is the same as its previous value, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is an integer input from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `j` is 3, `k` is 4**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is assigned the value of `j + 1`. Given that `j` is 3, `k` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
