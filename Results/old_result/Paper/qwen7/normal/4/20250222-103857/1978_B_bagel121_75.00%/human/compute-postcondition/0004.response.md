Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `a` is the second integer input.
- `b` is the third integer input.
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.

The print statement is `print(n * a)`. 

Since `n` is the first integer input and `a` is the second integer input, the expression `n * a` will be evaluated and printed. There is no specific value given for `n` or `a`, so we will refer to them by their names.

Output: **n * a (where n is the first integer input and a is the second integer input)**
