The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it accepts three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. Based on the relationship between `n`, `a`, and `b`, it calculates and prints the result for each test case. If `a >= b`, it prints `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates `k` as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, then computes `ans` and `p2` using specific formulas and prints `ans + p2`. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each case according to the given conditions.
