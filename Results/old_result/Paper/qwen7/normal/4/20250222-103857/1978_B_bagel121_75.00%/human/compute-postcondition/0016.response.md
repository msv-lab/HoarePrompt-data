Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input split from the user, `a` is the second integer input split from the user, `b` is the third integer input split from the user, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is assigned the value of the minimum between `b - a + 1` and `n`. Since `n`, `a`, and `b` are inputs from the user, their values remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 also remains valid.
