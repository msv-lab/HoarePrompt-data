Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the first integer input split from the user, `a` is the second integer input split from the user, `b` is the third integer input split from the user, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, and `p2` is `(n - k) * a`. If `a >= b`, the function does not change `k`, `ans`, and `p2`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to be the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is recalculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, and `p2` is updated to `(n - k) * a`.**
