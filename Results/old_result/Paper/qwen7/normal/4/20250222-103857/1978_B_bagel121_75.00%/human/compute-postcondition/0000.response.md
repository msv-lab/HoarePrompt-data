Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input is not specified in the initial state, `t` is left as an input integer representing the number of test cases. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not involved in this line of code.
