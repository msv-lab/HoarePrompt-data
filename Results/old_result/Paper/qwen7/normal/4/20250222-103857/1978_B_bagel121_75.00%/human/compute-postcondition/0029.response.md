Let's break down the initial state and the calculation step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t > 1` (This is just a condition and doesn't affect the calculation directly).
   - `n` is the first integer input from the user.
   - `a` is the second integer input from the user.
   - `b` is the third integer input from the user.
   - `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.
   - `k` is updated to be the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n` again (though this does not change the value of `k` since it was already set).

2. **Calculating `ans`**:
   - `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
     - Simplify the expression inside `ans`: 
       \[
       ans = \text{int}\left(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1)) \cdot k}{2}\right) = \text{int}\left(\frac{(2b - k + 1) \cdot k}{2}\right)
       \]

3. **Calculating `p2`**:
   - `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.

4. **Final Expression**:
   - The print statement is `print(ans + p2)`.
   - Substitute the expressions for `ans` and `p2`:
     \[
     \text{print}\left(\text{int}\left(\frac{(2b - k + 1) \cdot k}{2}\right) + (n - k) \cdot a\right)
     \]

Given the above, the output will be the result of the expression `int((2b - k + 1) * k / 2) + (n - k) * a`.

Output: **int((2b - k + 1) * k / 2) + (n - k) * a**
