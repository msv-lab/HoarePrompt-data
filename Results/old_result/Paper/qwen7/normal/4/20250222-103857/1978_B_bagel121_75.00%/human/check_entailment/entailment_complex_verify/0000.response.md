### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to verify its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b` as integers.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if `a >= b`. If true, it prints `n * a` directly, which is correct because selling all buns at the usual price would be optimal.
   - If `a < b`, it proceeds to calculate the maximum profit.

3. **Calculation of Maximum Profit:**
   - The program calculates `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`, which is the number of buns to be sold at the modified price.
   - It then calculates `ans` using the formula `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, which is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` down to `b - k + 1`.
   - It also calculates `p2` as `(n - k) * a`, which is the total revenue from selling the remaining buns at the usual price.
   - Finally, it prints `ans + p2`.

4. **Optimality Check:**
   - The original assessment claimed that the program might not always yield the optimal result because it only considers the case where `k` is equal to `min(b - a + 1, n)`.
   - However, the program actually considers all possible values of `k` from 0 to `min(b - a + 1, n)` through the arithmetic series formula. The value of `k` is derived from the condition `min(b - a + 1, n)`, ensuring that all possible scenarios are covered.

5. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - Consider the test case `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
     - `a < b`, so we need to calculate the profit for different values of `k`.
     - For `k = 0`, the profit is `5 * 5 = 25`.
     - For `k = 1`, the profit is `9 + 4 * 5 = 29`.
     - For `k = 2`, the profit is `9 + 8 + 3 * 5 = 32`.
     - For `k = 3`, the profit is `9 + 8 + 7 + 2 * 5 = 33`.
     - For `k = 4`, the profit is `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 1 * 5 = 35`.
     - For `k = 5`, the profit is `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 0 * 5 = 35`.
     - The maximum profit is indeed 35, which matches the expected output.

Given the analysis, the program correctly calculates the maximum profit for all potential cases by considering all possible values of `k` through the arithmetic series formula.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
