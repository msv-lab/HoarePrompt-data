Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input split from the user, `a` is the second integer input split from the user, `b` is the third integer input split from the user, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k), `p2` is `(n - k) * a`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `(n - k) * a` to the variable `p2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
