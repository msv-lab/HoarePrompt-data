Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(1, removals + 1)`. This means `i` will increment from 1 to `removals`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is equal to its original value minus the last element of the list `elements`, and `i` is unchanged; `pos` is appended with the value `s - 2 * s2`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `removals`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is unchanged at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the next iteration is that `i` should still be less than or equal to `removals`.

Given this, let's update the states accordingly:

- `s` remains unchanged.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `pos` is appended with the value `s - 2 * s2` (this part does not change since it is appended at the end of each iteration).

So, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is equal to its original value minus the last element of the list `elements`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `pos` is appended with the value `s - 2 * s2`**.

However, to clearly express the state, we can reformat it as follows:

State: **`s` is equal to its original value minus the last element of the list `elements`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `pos` is appended with the value `s - 2 * s2`**.
