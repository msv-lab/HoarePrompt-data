The function accepts three parameters: `removals` (the maximum number of elements Alice can remove), `negatives` (the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1), and `elements` (a list of integers). It calculates a series of values based on removing elements and optionally negating some elements, storing these values in a list. Finally, it returns the maximum value from this list.
