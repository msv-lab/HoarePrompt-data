Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(1, removals + 1)`. This means `i` will take values from 1 to `removals` (inclusive).

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `removals + 1`, the initial value of `i` should be set to 1.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `removals`. Therefore, `removals` must be a positive integer for the loop to start executing.

4. **Adjust Other Variables**: The other variables (`pos`, `negatives`, `elements`, and `s2`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, they should maintain their initial states as given.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be set to 1.
- `removals` must be a positive integer.

So, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `removals` must be a positive integer**
