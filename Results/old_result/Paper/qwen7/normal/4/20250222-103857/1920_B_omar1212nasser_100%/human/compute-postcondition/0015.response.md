Output State: **`s` is equal to its original value minus the last element of the list `elements`, and `i` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `s2 -= elements[-i]` subtracts the last element of the list `elements` from `s2`. Since `s` is mentioned to be decreased by the last element of the list `elements`, it implies that `s2` is the same as `s` in this context. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
