Output State: The final state of the loop will be as follows:

- `s` will be the original value of `s` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements of the list `elements`.
- `s2` will be the original value of `s2` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements of the list `elements`.
- If `negatives + removals` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, then `s2` will also include the addition of the element at the index `-(negatives + removals)` from the end of the list `elements`.
- `pos` will be a list containing the values of `s - 2 * s2` after each iteration of the loop, starting from the first iteration up to the last iteration where `i` equals `removals`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `s` and `s2` will reflect the cumulative effect of removing the last `removals` elements and optionally adjusting `s2` based on the condition involving `negatives`. The list `pos` will contain the computed values of `s - 2 * s2` for each iteration of the loop.
