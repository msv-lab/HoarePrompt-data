Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `removals` is a positive integer
   - `s` is `s` minus `elements[-1]`
   - `s2` is `s2` minus `elements[-1]`
   - If the sum of `negatives` and `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, then `s2` is updated to `s2 + elements[-(negatives + i)]`
   - `pos` is a list with one element which is `s - 2 * s2`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, removals + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `removals`.

4. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

5. **Next Value of `i`:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.

6. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i <= removals`.
   - Since `removals` is a positive integer, `i` (which is now 2) is still less than or equal to `removals`.

7. **Updating States:**
   - `i` will be updated to 2.
   - `s` will be updated to `s - elements[-1]` (since `i` was 1, this part was already done).
   - `s2` will be updated to `s2 - elements[-1]` (since `i` was 1, this part was already done).
   - If the condition `negatives + i <= len(elements)` holds true, `s2` will be updated to `s2 + elements[-(negatives + i)]`.
   - `pos` will remain a list with one element which is `s - 2 * s2`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` is 2
- `removals` remains the same
- `s` is `s - elements[-1]`
- `s2` is `s2 - elements[-1]`
- `s2` may be updated if `negatives + i <= len(elements)`
- `pos` is a list with one element which is `s - 2 * s2`

Since we don't know the exact value of `negatives` and `len(elements)`, we'll keep it general.

**State:**
**`i` is 2, `removals` is a positive integer, `s` is `s - elements[-1]`, `s2` is `s2 - elements[-1]`, if `negatives + 2 <= len(elements)`, then `s2` is updated to `s2 + elements[-(negatives + 2)], `pos` is a list with one element which is `s - 2 * s2`**
