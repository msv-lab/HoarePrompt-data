The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers. It sorts the list \( a \) and then calls another function `func_2(k, x, a)` to compute a product value. After processing all test cases, it prints the computed product for each case. The final state includes the number of test cases processed (`t`), the index `i` set to `t`, and the computed product for the last test case.
