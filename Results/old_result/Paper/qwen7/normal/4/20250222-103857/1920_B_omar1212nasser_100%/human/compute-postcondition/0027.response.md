Output State: The final state of the loop will have `i` equal to `removals + 1`, `s` equal to its original value minus the sum of the last `removals` elements of `elements`, `s2` equal to the sum of the last `negatives + removals` elements of `elements`, and `pos` being a list containing `removals` elements, each calculated as `s - 2 * s2`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be the total number of removals (`removals`), `s` will be the initial value minus the sum of the last `removals` elements of `elements`, `s2` will be the sum of the last `negatives + removals` elements of `elements`, and `pos` will be a list of `removals` elements, each computed as `s - 2 * s2`.
