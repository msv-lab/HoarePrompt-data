Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `q` is 2, `count` is 1, `s` is an input string, `flag` is 0, `i` is equal to `len(s) - 2`, `len(s)` must be at least 2, and the current value of `s[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s[i + 1]`**.

This postcondition summarizes that after the execution of the if-else block, `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `q` stays as 2, `count` is incremented to 1, `s` is an input string, `flag` remains 0, `i` is still equal to `len(s) - 2`, `len(s)` is at least 2, and importantly, the characters at positions `i` and `i+1` in the string `s` are different.
