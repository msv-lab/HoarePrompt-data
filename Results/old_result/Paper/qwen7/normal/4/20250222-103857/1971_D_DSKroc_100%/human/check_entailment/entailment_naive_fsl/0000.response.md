Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the string has multiple segments of consecutive '0's followed by '1's. For example, consider the input string "01010". The program would incorrectly output 2, but the correct answer is 3 because the string can be split into "0", "10", and "10".

Here is a counterexample:
- Input: `01010`
- Expected Output: `3`
- Program Output: `2`

This demonstrates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, hence the correctness is **False**.
