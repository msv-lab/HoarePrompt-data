Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 0
    flag = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
        if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
            count += 1
        if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
            flag = 1
    if flag == 0:
        print(count + 1)
    else:
        print(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `q` is 0, `count` is between 0 and the length of `s` - 1 inclusive, `s` is a non-empty string, `flag` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the condition `flag == 0` is true or false, `i` is equal to the length of `s` - 2, and `count` is incremented each time there is a change in the consecutive characters where the next character is greater than the current one.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `q` is 1, `count` is equal to the number of times the characters in `s` do not match consecutively, `s` is the input string, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `len(s) - 2`, and the last comparison in the loop checks if the character at position `i` in `s` is equal to or not equal to the character at position `i + 1` in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `q` is 2, `count` is equal to the number of times the digits in string `s` are not equal, `s` is an input string, `flag` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1])` was true at least once, and `i` is equal to `len(s) - 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
