Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though its value is not relevant to the print statement).
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `a` is assigned the first integer from input.
- `b` is assigned the second integer from input.
- `m` is assigned the third integer from input.

The print statement `print(2)` simply outputs the integer 2, regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **2**
