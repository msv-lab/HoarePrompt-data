Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `t` is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the new state of `t` is an integer that falls within this range, and it is specifically the integer input provided by the user. All other variables remain unchanged, and the precondition that `t` is within the specified range remains valid.
