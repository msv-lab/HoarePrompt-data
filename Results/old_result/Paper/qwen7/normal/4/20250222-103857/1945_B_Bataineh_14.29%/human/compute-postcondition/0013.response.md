Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is assigned the first integer from input, `b` is assigned the second integer from input, `m` is assigned the third integer from input.** 

This postcondition remains the same because both the if and else parts do not change the values of the variables `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `m`. The only difference is in the condition checked within the if statement, but since neither part modifies the variables, the postcondition stays unchanged.
