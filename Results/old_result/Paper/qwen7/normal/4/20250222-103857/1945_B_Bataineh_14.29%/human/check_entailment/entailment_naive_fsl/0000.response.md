Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. According to the problem description, the visibility period of each firework is \(m + 1\) minutes, but the program uses \(m\) minutes. This discrepancy leads to an incorrect calculation.

For example, consider the input:
```
6 7 4
```
- The first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, so the launch times are 0, 6, 12, 18, ...
- The second installation launches fireworks every 7 minutes, so the launch times are 0, 7, 14, 21, ...

The program calculates:
- \(m = 4\)
- \(m // a = 4 // 6 = 0\)
- \(m // b = 4 // 7 = 0\)

Thus, the program prints `2`, which is incorrect. The correct calculation should consider the full visibility period \(m + 1 = 5\) minutes. After 7 minutes, both installations launch fireworks at the same time, making it possible to see 2 fireworks simultaneously.

Therefore, the program does not handle the visibility period correctly and fails to provide the accurate result for some inputs.
