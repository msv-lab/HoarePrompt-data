### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not accurately calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time due to overcounting. The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` incorrectly adds up the number of fireworks from both installations without accounting for overlaps.

To properly solve this problem, we need to find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and use it to determine the number of unique time slots where fireworks are visible. The number of unique time slots is given by `(m // LCM(a, b)) + 1` (for the initial fireworks at time `0`). Additionally, we need to add the number of fireworks launched by each installation within `m` minutes, ensuring we do not double-count the overlapping fireworks.

Here is a corrected approach:

1. Calculate the LCM of `a` and `b`.
2. Determine the number of unique time slots where fireworks are visible using `(m // LCM(a, b)) + 1`.
3. Add the number of fireworks launched by each installation within `m` minutes, ensuring no double-counting.

### Corrected Program:

```python
import math

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // math.gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        unique_slots = m // lcm_ab + 1
        fireworks_from_a = m // a
        fireworks_from_b = m // b
        max_fireworks = unique_slots + fireworks_from_a + fireworks_from_b - 1
        print(max_fireworks)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment correctly identified the flaw in the given program. The provided solution addresses the issue by calculating the LCM and ensuring proper counting of overlapping fireworks.

**Final: False**
