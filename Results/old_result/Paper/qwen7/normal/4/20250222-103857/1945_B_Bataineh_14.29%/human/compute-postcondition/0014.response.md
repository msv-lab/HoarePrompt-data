Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < t`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `a` is assigned the first integer from input.
   - `b` is assigned the second integer from input.
   - `m` is assigned the third integer from input.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `t` must remain the same (since it does not change within the loop) and must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is assigned the first integer from input, `b` is assigned the second integer from input, `m` is assigned the third integer from input**
