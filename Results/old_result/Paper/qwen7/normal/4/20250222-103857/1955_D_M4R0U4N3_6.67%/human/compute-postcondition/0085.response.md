Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `r` will be equal to `n`, `old` will be the last element processed in the loop, `extra` will contain all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` and hence added to `extra` during the loop, `done` will contain all elements from `a` that were removed from `todo`, and `todo` will contain none of the elements from `a` that were initially in `todo` and not removed during the loop. The variable `ans` will be 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise it will be 0.
