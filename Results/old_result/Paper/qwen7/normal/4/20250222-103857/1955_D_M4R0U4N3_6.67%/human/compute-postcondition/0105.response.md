Output State: **`j` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is either the same as before or with `a[0]` removed, `done` contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is empty, and `extra` contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo`, `extra` now includes `a[j]` which is `a[1]` since `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `extra.add(a[j])` adds the element at index `j` of the list `a` to the set `extra`. Since `j` is 1, `extra` now includes `a[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
