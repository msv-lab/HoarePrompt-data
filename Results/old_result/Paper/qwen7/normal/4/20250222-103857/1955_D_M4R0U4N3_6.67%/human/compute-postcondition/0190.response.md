Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `todo` is a set of integers without the element `a[j]`, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set, `j` is 0.**

The code `todo.remove(a[j])` removes the element `a[j]` from the set `todo`. All other variables remain unchanged.
