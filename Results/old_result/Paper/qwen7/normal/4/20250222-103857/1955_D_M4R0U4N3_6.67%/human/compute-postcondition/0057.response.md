Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `old` is no longer in `extra`, `extra` does not include `a[r - m]`, `done` remains unchanged, and `todo` either contains `a[r]` or does not contain `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The line `extra.remove(old)` removes the value of `old` from the list `extra`. Since `old` was previously defined as `a[r - m]`, after executing this line, `old` is no longer present in `extra`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
