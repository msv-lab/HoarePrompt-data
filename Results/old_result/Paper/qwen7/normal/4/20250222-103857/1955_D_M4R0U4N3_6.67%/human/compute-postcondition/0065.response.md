Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `old` is either no longer in `extra` or is now `a[r - m]`, `extra` includes `a[r]`, `done` is `done` minus `old` if `old` is in `done`, and `todo` either contains `a[r]` and `a[r - m]` if `old` is in `done`, or contains `a[r]` or does not contain `a[r]` if `old` is not in `done`.**

Explanation:
- The line `extra.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`.
- Since `r` is defined as `m + 1`, `r - m` equals 1.
- The value of `old` either no longer exists in `extra` or is now `a[r - m]`, which is `a[1]`.
- After adding `a[r]` to `extra`, the state of `extra` changes to include `a[r]`.
- The value of `done` is adjusted by subtracting `old` from it if `old` is present in `done`.
- The state of `todo` depends on whether `old` was in `done` or not. If `old` was in `done`, `todo` will contain both `a[r]` and `a[r - m]` (which is `a[1]`). If `old` was not in `done`, `todo` will either contain `a[r]` or not contain `a[r]` depending on its original state.
