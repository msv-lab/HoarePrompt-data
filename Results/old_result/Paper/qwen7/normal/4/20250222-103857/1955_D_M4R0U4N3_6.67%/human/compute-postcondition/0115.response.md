Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `r`, `m`, and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `r` in the range from `m` to `n`. This means `r` starts from `m` and goes up to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `r`**: Since the loop starts with `r` being `m`, the initial value of `r` should be `m`.

4. **Determine the Final State of `r`**: According to the problem statement, after all iterations of the loop, `j` will be equal to `m-1`. However, since `r` is incremented in each iteration and the loop condition is `r < n`, the final value of `r` will be `n-1`.

5. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the loop can start and run correctly. The initial value of `r` should be `m`, and the loop will continue as long as `r` is less than `n`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `r` should be `m` at the start of the loop.
- `m` and `n` should be such that the loop can execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`r` is `m`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`**.
