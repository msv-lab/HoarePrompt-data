Output State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `ans` is 0, `r` is `m`, `old` is `a[r - m]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[r - m]` to the variable `old`. This does not affect the values of `ans`, `r`, or the condition related to `done` and `k`. Therefore, the output state retains the original conditions for `ans` and updates `old` to be the value of `a[r - m]`.
