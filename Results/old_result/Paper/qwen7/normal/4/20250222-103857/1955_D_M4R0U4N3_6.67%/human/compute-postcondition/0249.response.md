Output State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, else `ans` is 0; `r` is `m + 1`; `extra` now contains `a[r]`; if `old` is in `extra`, then `extra` has had `old` removed from it. Otherwise, `todo` contains `old`, and `done` has removed `old` if `old` was in `done`.**

Explanation: The code `extra.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. This changes the state of the `extra` set. The values of `ans`, `r`, `old`, `todo`, and `done` remain unchanged according to the initial postconditions provided.
