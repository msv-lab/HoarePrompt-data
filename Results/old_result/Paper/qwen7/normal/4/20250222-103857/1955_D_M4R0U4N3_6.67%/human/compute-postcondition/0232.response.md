Postcondition: `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, else `ans` is 0; `r` is `m`; if `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not contain `old`, `old` is no longer in `extra`, and `done` now contains `a[r]` with one element removed from `todo`; if `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `ans` remains unchanged, `todo` does not contain `old`, `old` is no longer in `extra`, and `extra` contains `a[r]`.
