Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `r` is `m + 1`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`, if `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `extra` list remains unchanged, `done` list has the element `a[r]` added, and `todo` list has had the element `a[r]` removed, if `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `extra` now contains the element `a[r]`, and `done` and `todo` remain unchanged.**

In this output state, `ans` has been incremented by 1. The conditions related to the lists `extra`, `done`, and `todo` remain as described in the initial state, with the only change being the addition or inclusion of `a[r]` based on its presence in `todo`.
