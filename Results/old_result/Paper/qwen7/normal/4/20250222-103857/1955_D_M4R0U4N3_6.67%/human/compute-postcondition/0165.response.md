Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`, `done` has had the element `old` removed, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`, `todo` now contains the element `old`**.

The code adds the value of `old` to the set `todo`. Since `old` is defined as `a[r - m]`, and no other variables are affected, the updated state includes `todo` now containing the element `old`.
