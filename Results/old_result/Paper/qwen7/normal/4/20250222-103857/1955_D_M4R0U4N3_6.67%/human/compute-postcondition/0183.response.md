Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input value, `k` is an integer equal to the third input value**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list called `a`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. Since `n-1` is no longer directly referenced, its initial state is not relevant to the final output state.
