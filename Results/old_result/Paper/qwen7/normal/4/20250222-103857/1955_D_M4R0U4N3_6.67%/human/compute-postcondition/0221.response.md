Postcondition: `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `ans` is 0; `r` is `m`; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `old` is not in `done`. If `old` is in `done`, `ans` becomes 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k` - 1, else `ans` remains 0; `r` is still `m`; `todo` contains `old`; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `old` is no longer in `done`.
