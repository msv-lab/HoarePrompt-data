Output State: **`r` is `m`, `extra` is the list with the element `old` removed.**

Explanation: The variable `old` is equal to `a[m - m]`, which simplifies to `a[0]` since `m - m` equals 0. The code removes `old` from the list `extra`. Therefore, `extra` is the list with its first element removed. The values of `r` and `old` remain unchanged.
