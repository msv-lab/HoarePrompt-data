Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`, `done` has had the element `old` removed, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`, `todo` has added the element `old`.**

Explanation: The code adds the element `old` to the set `todo`. The value of `old` is `a[r - m]`, which remains unchanged. All other variables and their relationships remain the same as the initial state.
