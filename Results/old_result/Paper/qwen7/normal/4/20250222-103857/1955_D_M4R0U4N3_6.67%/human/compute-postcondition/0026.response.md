Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `j` will be equal to `m`, `todo` will contain none of the elements from `a` that were initially in `todo` and not removed during the loop, `done` will contain all elements from `a` that were removed from `todo`, and `extra` will contain all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` and hence added to `extra` during the loop.**

In more detail:
- The variable `j` will be equal to `m` after all iterations since the loop runs `m` times.
- The `todo` set will be empty because every element that was in `todo` and matched an element in `a` during the loop iterations would have been removed.
- The `done` set will contain all elements from `a` that were present in `todo` and successfully removed during the loop.
- The `extra` set will contain all elements from `a` that were not found in `todo` and thus added to `extra` during each iteration where they did not match any element in `todo`.
