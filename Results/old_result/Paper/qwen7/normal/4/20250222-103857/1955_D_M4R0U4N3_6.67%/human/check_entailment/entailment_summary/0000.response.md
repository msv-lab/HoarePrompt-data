Reasoning:

1. The program correctly initializes variables and sets up the necessary data structures (`todo`, `done`, and `extra`) to track the elements in the current window of size `m` from the array `a`.
2. It iterates through the array `a` to populate the initial `done` and `extra` sets based on the elements present in the first `m` elements.
3. The main loop processes each subsequent element in `a` by updating the `done` and `extra` sets as the window slides one position to the right.
4. It checks if the size of the `done` set is greater than or equal to `k` and increments the answer accordingly.
5. The logic for adding and removing elements from the `done` and `extra` sets is correct, ensuring that only relevant elements are considered.
6. The program handles the sliding window approach correctly, maintaining the invariant that the `done` set contains elements that have been seen in the current window and match elements in `b`.

Given the execution summary and the detailed analysis of the code, the program appears to implement the logic correctly according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
