Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the situation:

1. `r` will be equal to `n-1` after all iterations of the loop finish.
2. `m` and `n` are integers with `n > m`.
3. `a[r]` is either in `todo` or not in `todo`.
4. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `done` will contain `a[r]`, and `extra` will remain unchanged.
5. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `extra` will contain `a[r]`, and `done` and `todo` will remain unchanged.
6. `ans` will be 1 if the size of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise it will be 0.
7. All elements of `a` that were not added to `done` will be in `extra`.

The key point here is the value of `ans`, which depends on the size of the set `done` relative to `k`.

Given this, the value of `ans` can only be determined by knowing the size of `done`. Since the exact contents of `a`, `todo`, and `k` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` will be either 0 or 1 based on the size of `done`.

Therefore, the output will be a boolean value representing whether the size of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Output: **ans (where ans is 1 if the size of done is >= k, otherwise 0)**
