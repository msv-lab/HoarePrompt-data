Output State: **`ans` is `ans` + 1, `r` is `m + 1`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`, if `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `done` now contains `a[r]`, if `a[r]` is in `todo`, `extra` remains unchanged, if `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `extra` now contains `a[r]`, and `done` and `todo` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The values of `r`, `m`, `n`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, and `extra` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is its original value plus one, while the other variables retain their initial conditions.
