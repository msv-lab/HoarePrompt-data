Postcondition: `r` is `m + 1`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `done` now contains `a[r]`. If `a[r]` is in `extra`, then `extra` list has the value of `a[r]` removed. If `a[r]` is not in `done` and `extra`, then `extra` now contains `a[r]`, and `done` and `todo` remain unchanged.
