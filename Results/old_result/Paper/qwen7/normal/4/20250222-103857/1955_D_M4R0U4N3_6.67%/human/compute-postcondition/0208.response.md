Output State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `ans` is 0; `a` is a list of integers, `m` is equal to the length of `a`, `k` is an integer, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set containing all elements from `todo` that were found in `a`, and `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not found in `todo`.**

This means that the variable `ans` is now assigned the value 1 if the number of elements in the set `done` is greater than or equal to the integer `k`, otherwise `ans` is assigned the value 0. All other variables remain in their original state.
