Output State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, else `ans` is 0; `r` is `m + 1`; `old` is `a[m]`**.

Explanation: The code `old = a[r - m]` assigns the value of `a[r - m]` to the variable `old`. Given that `r` is `m + 1`, the expression `r - m` simplifies to `1`. Therefore, `old` is assigned the value of `a[1]`. The values of `ans` and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
