Output State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m`, `n`, `a`, `extra` contains `a[r]`, `done` remains unchanged if `old` is in `done`, otherwise `todo` now includes `a[r]` and `a[r - m]` if `old` was in `done`, or contains `a[r]` or does not contain `a[r]` if `old` is not in `done`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if the length of `done` is at least `k` after the operation.**

Explanation: The code adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. This directly impacts the `extra` set by adding `a[r]` to it. The other variables (`r`, `m`, `n`, `a`, `done`, `todo`, and `ans`) remain unchanged unless `old` is in `done`, which would cause `done` to be reduced by `old` (if `old` was present) and `ans` to be incremented by 1 if the length of `done` is at least `k`. However, since no specific value for `old` is given, we cannot determine if `old` is in `done`. Therefore, the state of `done` and `ans` remains as per the conditions mentioned.
