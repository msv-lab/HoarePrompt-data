Output State: **`n` is the input integer minus 1, `m` is the input integer `m`, `k` is the input integer `k`, `r` is equal to `n`, `old` is the last element processed in the loop, `extra` is an empty set, `done` is an empty set, `todo` is now a set of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise it is 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The line `extra = set()` creates an empty set named `extra`. All other variables retain their previous values. The `extra` variable is updated to be an empty set, while the other variables remain unchanged.
