Postcondition: `i` is 0, `q` is a positive integer, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the index in `inds[x[r]]` where the element is less than `l` or the first element if no such element exists, `upper` is the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the element is less than or equal to `r` or the first element if no such element exists, and either `upper` is greater than `lower` or `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.
