Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to 1.
- `q` is a positive integer.
- `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`.
- `r` is the return value of `func_1(int)`.
- `lower` is the index in `inds[x[r]]` where the element is less than `l` or the first element if no such element exists.
- `upper` is the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the element is less than or equal to `r` or the first element if no such element exists.
- Either `upper` is greater than `lower` or `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.

The print statement is `print('Yes')`.

Given this information, the print statement will simply output the string "Yes" regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **Yes**
