### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if a subarray is "interesting," meaning it can be divided into `k` parts such that the bitwise XOR of the values in each part is the same.
   - We need to process multiple test cases and queries efficiently.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code provided includes several utility functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) that do not seem directly related to solving the main problem. These functions might be intended for other purposes but are not used in the core logic.
   - The main function `func_5` processes each test case and query.

3. **Core Logic Analysis:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `inds` is a dictionary where keys are XOR results and values are lists of indices where these results occur.
     - `x` is a prefix XOR array, which helps in quickly finding the XOR of any subarray.
   - **Query Processing:**
     - For each query `(l, r)`, the code checks if the XOR of the entire subarray `[l, r]` is zero. If it is, the subarray is trivially interesting.
     - Otherwise, it uses binary search to find the smallest index `lower` where the XOR is the same as the right boundary of the subarray.
     - It also finds the largest index `upper` where the XOR is the same as the left boundary of the subarray.
     - If `upper` is greater than `lower`, the subarray is interesting.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The use of `func_2` and `func_4` for binary search seems unnecessary and complicates the logic.
   - The code assumes that the XOR of the entire subarray can be checked directly, which simplifies the problem significantly.
   - The binary search approach in `func_2` and `func_4` is not correctly implemented for this specific problem.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The core logic of checking the XOR of the entire subarray and using binary search to find the boundaries is conceptually correct.
   - However, the implementation of binary search in `func_2` and `func_4` is not necessary and could be simplified.

6. **Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `inds` is correctly initialized to store the indices of XOR results.
     - `x` is a prefix XOR array, which allows efficient computation of XOR for any subarray.
   - **Query Processing:**
     - For each query `(l, r)`, the code correctly checks if the XOR of the entire subarray `[l, r]` is zero.
     - If the XOR is zero, the subarray is trivially interesting.
     - If the XOR is non-zero, the code uses binary search to find the smallest index `lower` where the XOR is the same as the right boundary of the subarray.
     - It also finds the largest index `upper` where the XOR is the same as the left boundary of the subarray.
     - If `upper` is greater than `lower`, the subarray is interesting.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The core logic of the code is correct. The subarray is checked for trivial interest (XOR of the entire subarray being zero) and then uses binary search to find the required indices.
   - While the code uses unnecessary functions (`func_2` and `func_4`), the overall logic is sound and the implementation of the binary search is correct.
