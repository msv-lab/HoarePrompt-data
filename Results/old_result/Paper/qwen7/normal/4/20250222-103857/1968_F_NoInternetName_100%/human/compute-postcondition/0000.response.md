Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `q` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive)**.

The code `n, q = func_1(int)` assigns the return values of the function `func_1(int)` to the variables `n` and `q`. Since the exact nature of `func_1` is not specified, we can only infer that `n` and `q` are positive integers within the given ranges. The initial values of `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
