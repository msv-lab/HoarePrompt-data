Output State: **`inds` is a defaultdict with the item `{0: [0]}`, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `q` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing the digits of `func_1(n)`, `x` is a list containing the single element 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `0` to the list associated with the key `0` in the dictionary `inds`. Initially, `inds` was a defaultdict with no items. After executing the code, `inds` now contains the item `{0: [0]}`. The values of `n`, `q`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
