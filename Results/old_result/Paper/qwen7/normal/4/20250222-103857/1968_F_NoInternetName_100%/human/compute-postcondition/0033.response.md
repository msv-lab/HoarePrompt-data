Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `q`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < q`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `q` is a positive integer
   - `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`
   - `r` is the return value of `func_1(int)`
   - `lower` is the index in `inds[x[r]]` where the element is less than `l` or the first element if no such element exists
   - `upper` is the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the element is less than or equal to `r` or the first element if no such element exists
   - Either `upper` is greater than `lower` or `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increases by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `q` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
   - The values of `l`, `r`, `lower`, and `upper` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.

5. **New state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` is 1 (since `i` is incremented by 1)
   - `q` is still a positive integer
   - `l` is still the return value of `func_1(int)`
   - `r` is still the return value of `func_1(int)`
   - `lower` is still the index in `inds[x[r]]` where the element is less than `l` or the first element if no such element exists
   - `upper` is still the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the element is less than or equal to `r` or the first element if no such element exists
   - Either `upper` is greater than `lower` or `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `q` is a positive integer, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the index in `inds[x[r]]` where the element is less than `l` or the first element if no such element exists, `upper` is the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the element is less than or equal to `r` or the first element if no such element exists, and either `upper` is greater than `lower` or `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.**
