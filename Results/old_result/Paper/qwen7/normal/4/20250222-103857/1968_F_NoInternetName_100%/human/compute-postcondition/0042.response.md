Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `q` is a positive integer.
- `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`.
- `r` is the return value of `func_1(int)`.
- `upper` is the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the element is less than or equal to `r` or the first element if no such element exists.

The print statement is:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'No'` without any dependence on the values of the other variables or objects.

Output: **No**
