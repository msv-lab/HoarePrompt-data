Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` must be a positive integer, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, and the last element of `x` at index `l-1` is equal to the element of `x` at index `r`. We continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the only thing we can infer is that the execution continues with the next iteration of whatever loop or process it was part of. The values of the variables remain unchanged.
