Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly set to 0.
- `q` is a positive integer.
- `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`.
- `r` is the return value of `func_1(int)`.
- `lower` is the index in `inds[x[r]]` where the element is less than `l` or the first element if no such element exists.
- `upper` is the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the element is less than or equal to `r` or the first element if no such element exists.
- `upper` is explicitly stated to be greater than `lower`.

The print statement is simply `print('Yes')`.

Given this information, the output of the print statement is a straightforward string "Yes".

Output: **Yes**
