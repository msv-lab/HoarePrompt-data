Output State: **`inds` is a defaultdict with the item `{0: [0, 1, 2], 1: [1, 2]}`, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `q` is a positive integer between 1 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list containing at least two less digits of `func_1(n)` than before, `x` is a list `[0, 1, 1, 2, 1]`**

Explanation: The code appends to the list `x` the value of `x[-1] ^ i`, where `x[-1]` is the last element of `x` (which is 2) and `i` is the index of the new element being appended (which is 3 since `x` now has 5 elements). So, `x[-1] ^ i` is `2 ^ 3`, which equals `1`. Therefore, `x` becomes `[0, 1, 1, 2, 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
