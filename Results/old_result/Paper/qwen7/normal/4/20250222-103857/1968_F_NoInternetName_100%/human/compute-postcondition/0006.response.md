Output State: **`inds` is a defaultdict with the item `{0: [0]}`, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `q` is a positive integer between 1 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list containing at least one digit of `func_1(n)`, `x` is a list `[0, 0]`**

Explanation: The code `x.append(x[-1] ^ i)` appends to the list `x` the value of `x[-1]` (which is initially 0) XORed with `i`. Since `i` starts from 0, the first element of `x` remains 0, and the second element becomes `0 ^ 0`, which is 0. Therefore, `x` becomes `[0, 0]`. All other variables (`inds`, `n`, `q`, `a`) remain unchanged.
