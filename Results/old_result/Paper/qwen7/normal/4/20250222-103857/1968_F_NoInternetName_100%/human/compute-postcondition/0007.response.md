Output State: **`inds` is a defaultdict with the item `{0: [0, 1]}`, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `q` is a positive integer between 1 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list containing at least one digit of `func_1(n)`, `x` is a list `[0, 1]`**

Explanation: The code appends the length of the list `x` (which is 2) minus 1 to the list `inds[x[-1]]`. Initially, `inds[0]` contains `[0]`. Since `x[-1]` is `x[1]` which is `0`, the code appends `1` to `inds[0]`, making `inds[0]` equal to `[0, 1]`. The other variables (`n`, `q`, `a`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
