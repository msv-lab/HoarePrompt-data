### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if a subarray is "interesting," meaning it can be divided into `k` parts such that the bitwise XOR of the values in each part is the same.
   - We need to process multiple test cases and queries efficiently.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code provided includes several utility functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) that do not seem directly related to solving the main problem. These functions might be intended for other purposes but are not used in the core logic.
   - The main function `func_5` processes each test case and query.

3. **Core Logic Analysis:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `inds` is a dictionary where keys are XOR results and values are lists of indices where these results occur.
     - `x` is a prefix XOR array, which helps in quickly finding the XOR of any subarray.
   - **Query Processing:**
     - For each query `(l, r)`, the code checks if the XOR of the entire subarray `[l, r]` is zero. If it is, the subarray is trivially interesting.
     - Otherwise, it uses binary search to find the smallest index `lower` where the XOR is the same as the right boundary of the subarray.
     - It also finds the largest index `upper` where the XOR is the same as the left boundary of the subarray.
     - If `upper` is greater than `lower`, the subarray is interesting.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The use of `func_2` and `func_4` for binary search seems unnecessary and complicates the logic.
   - The code assumes that the XOR of the entire subarray can be checked directly, which simplifies the problem significantly.
   - The binary search approach in `func_2` and `func_4` is not correctly implemented for this specific problem.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The core logic of checking the XOR of the entire subarray and using binary search to find the boundaries is conceptually correct.
   - However, the implementation of binary search in `func_2` and `func_4` is not necessary and could be simplified.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is mostly correct in its logic but overly complicated with unnecessary functions. The core logic can be simplified without the need for binary search functions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
