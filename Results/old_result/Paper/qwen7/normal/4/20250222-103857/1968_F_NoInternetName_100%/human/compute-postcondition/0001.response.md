Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `q` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing the digits of `func_1(n)`**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(func_1(int))` creates a list `a` containing the digits of the result of `func_1(n)`. Since `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and `func_1` is not defined, we assume it returns an integer. The list `a` will contain the digits of that integer. The value of `q` remains unchanged.
