Output State: **`inds` is a defaultdict with the item `{0: [0, 1]}`, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `q` is a positive integer between 1 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list containing at least one less digit of `func_1(n)` than before, `x` is a list `[0, 1, 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `x.append(x[-1] ^ i)` appends to the list `x` the value of the last element of `x` (which is `1`) XORed with the index `i`. Since the initial value of `x` was `[0, 1]`, after appending, `x` becomes `[0, 1, 1]`. The other variables (`inds`, `n`, `q`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
