Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `q` is a positive integer.
- `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`.
- `r` is the return value of `func_1(int)`.
- The last element of `x` at index `l-1` is equal to the element of `x` at index `r`.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('Yes')
```

This statement will print the string 'Yes' regardless of the values of `i`, `q`, `l`, `r`, and the contents of the list `x`.

Output: **Yes**
