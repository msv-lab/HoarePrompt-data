Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is a positive integer, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the index in `inds[x[r]]` where the element is less than `l` or the first element if no such element exists, `upper` is the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the element is less than or equal to `r` or the first element if no such element exists, and either `upper` is greater than `lower` or `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, and `upper` remain unchanged, and the condition involving `upper` and `lower` also remains the same.
