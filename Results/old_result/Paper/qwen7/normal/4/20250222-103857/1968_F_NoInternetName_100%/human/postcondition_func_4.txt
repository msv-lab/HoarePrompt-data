The function processes a list `a` of integers and handles multiple queries defined by pairs of indices `(l, r)`. For each query, it checks if the prefix XOR sums up to `l-1` and `r` are equal. If they are, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it finds the smallest index in the list of indices where the prefix XOR sum is less than `l` and the largest index where the prefix XOR sum is less than or equal to `r`. If the upper bound index is greater than the lower bound index, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.
