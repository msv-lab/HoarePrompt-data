Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range of `int(input())`.
   - This means the loop will run as long as `i < int(input())`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0 (since it starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration).
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `int(input())`.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will execute again if `int(input())` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.
   - The value of `t` remains the same because it is not part of the loop head.
   - The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain the same because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `t` is still a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are still the integers obtained from the input split by spaces

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces**
