Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The only variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < int(input())`. 

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is the first integer input.
   - `b` is the second integer input.
   - `c` is the third integer input.
   - `d` is the fourth integer input.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - The value of `int(input())` must be such that it allows the loop to continue. Since `i` is now 2, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 2.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `t` remains unchanged and still needs to be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 2, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `c` is the third integer input, `d` is the fourth integer input**.
