You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
        
    #State: `i` is 3, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `c` is the third integer input, `d` is the fourth integer input, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence. For each test case, it calculates and prints the total count of these numbers, adjusted based on certain conditions involving the remainders when divided by 2. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program calculates the sum of half the counts of ones, twos, and threes plus an additional one if the sum of the counts of ones, twos, and threes modulo 2 equals 3. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the game's rules and does not account for the bitwise XOR operation. 

For example, consider the input `1 1 1 0`. According to the problem description, Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers is zero. In this case, the sequence is `[1, 1, 1]`, and the bitwise XOR is `1 ^ 1 ^ 1 = 1`, which means Alice wins. However, the program incorrectly outputs `1` because it follows the formula without considering the actual bitwise XOR result.

Another example is the input `0 9 9 9`. The sequence is `[2, 2, ..., 2]` (9 times), and the bitwise XOR of all these twos is `0`, so Bob should win. But the program incorrectly outputs `12` because it follows the formula without considering the actual bitwise XOR result.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the game's rules and is incorrect.
