Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `c` is the third integer input, `d` is the fourth integer input.**

The code `a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())` reads four integers separated by spaces from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` respectively. The variable `i` remains unchanged with its initial value of 1, and `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) is still valid.
