Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input split by spaces and converts each element into an integer, assigning them to `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The initial state of `i` and `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 0, and `t` is still a positive integer within the specified range. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the integers obtained from the input.
