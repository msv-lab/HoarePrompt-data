Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

# Annotated Functions:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where each element is a positive integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) and the length of the list n satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_a = sorted(a)
    concatenated_a = a + a
    for i in range(n):
        if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
            return 'Yes'
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and the function returns 'Yes' if there exists any index `i` such that the sub-list of `concatenated_a` from index `i` to `i + len(sorted_a)` is equal to `sorted_a`. If no such index exists, the function returns None.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, we check every possible starting index within the concatenated list to see if it matches the sorted version of the original list. If such a match is found at any point, the function will return 'Yes'. Otherwise, it will return None after completing all iterations.
    return 'No'
    #The program returns 'No'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a` and checks if there exists any starting index in the concatenated version of the list (where the list is appended to itself) such that the sub-list of length equal to the sorted version of `a` is equal to the sorted version of `a`. If such a sub-list is found, the function returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array a. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the elements of the array a.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        
        idx += n
        
        result = func_1(a)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be equal to the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is `idx + n + (total_iterations - 1)`, `results` is a list containing `total_iterations` elements which are the return values of `func_1(a)` for each iteration, `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[idx - 1])` for the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the slice of `data` starting from `idx - n - (total_iterations - 2)` and having length `n` for the last iteration, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)` for the last iteration.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be equal to the number of iterations, `idx` will be adjusted to point just past the last processed element in `data`, `results` will contain the results of applying `func_1(a)` for each iteration, and `n` and `a` will reflect the final iteration's parameters.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: the return values of func_1(a) for each iteration, each on a new line
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t indicating the number of test cases, followed by t pairs of integers. Each pair includes an integer n and a list a of n integers. For each test case, the function calls another function `func_1(a)` on the list a and collects the results. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of each test case on a new line.
