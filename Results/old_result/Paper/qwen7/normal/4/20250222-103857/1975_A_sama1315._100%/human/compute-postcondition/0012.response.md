Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is `idx + n`, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(a)`, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[idx]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and having length `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`**.

This means that the `results` list now contains one element, which is the result of calling the function `func_1` with the list `a`. All other variables retain their previous states, including the conditions and values they held initially.
