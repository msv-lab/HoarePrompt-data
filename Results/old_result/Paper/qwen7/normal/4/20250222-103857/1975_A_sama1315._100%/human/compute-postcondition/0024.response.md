Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is `idx + n + 2`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are the return value of `func_1(a)`, the previous element, `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[idx - 1])`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the slice of `data` starting from `idx - n - 1` and having length `n`.**

Explanation: The code `idx += n` increments the value of `idx` by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The updated value of `idx` is `idx + n`, and since `n` is defined as `int(data[idx - 1])`, the new value of `idx` is `idx + int(data[idx - 1]) + 2`.
