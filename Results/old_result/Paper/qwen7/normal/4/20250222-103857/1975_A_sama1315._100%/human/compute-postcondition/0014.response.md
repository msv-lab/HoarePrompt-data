Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is `idx + n`, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(a)`, `n` is an integer equal to `data[idx]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and having length `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`**

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[idx])` assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `idx` is updated to `idx + n`, and `n` is set to the integer value of the element at index `idx` in the list `data`.
