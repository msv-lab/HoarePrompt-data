Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
- `idx` is adjusted to `idx + n + (total_iterations - 1)`.
- `results` is a list containing `total_iterations` elements, each being the return value of `func_1(a)` for each iteration.
- `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[idx - 1])` for the last iteration.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the slice of `data` starting from `idx - n - (total_iterations - 2)` and having length `n` for the last iteration.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)` for the last iteration.

The `print('\n'.join(results))` statement will join all elements of the `results` list into a single string with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). 

Since `results` contains the return values of `func_1(a)` for each iteration, the output will be a sequence of these return values, each on a new line.

Output: **the return values of func_1(a) for each iteration, each on a new line**
