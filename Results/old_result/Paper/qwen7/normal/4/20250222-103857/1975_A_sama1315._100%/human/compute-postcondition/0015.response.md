Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(a)`, `n` is an integer equal to `data[idx]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and having length `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`**

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `idx` is updated to `idx + 1`, while `t`, `data`, `results`, `n`, `a`, and `result` retain their original values.
