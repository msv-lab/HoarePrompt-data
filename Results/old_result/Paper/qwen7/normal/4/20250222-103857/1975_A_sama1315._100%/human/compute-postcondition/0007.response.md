Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[idx]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[idx]` to `n`, where `idx` is initially 1. After executing `n = int(data[idx])`, `idx` is incremented by 1 (though not explicitly shown in the code, this is the typical behavior when accessing elements in a list with an index), making `idx` equal to 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
