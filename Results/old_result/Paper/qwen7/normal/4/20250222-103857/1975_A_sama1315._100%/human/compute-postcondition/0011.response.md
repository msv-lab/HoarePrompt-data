Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is `idx + n`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[idx]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and having length `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`**.

In this state, the variable `result` has been assigned the return value of the function `func_1(a)`. All other variables remain in their previous states as described in the initial state.
