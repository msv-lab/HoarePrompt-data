Output State: `t` must be equal to the total number of iterations the loop executed, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is the last index accessed plus one (`idx + n + (number_of_iterations - 3)`), `results` is a list containing all the elements returned by `func_1(a)` for each iteration, `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[idx - 1])` for the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the slice of `data` starting from `idx - n - (number_of_iterations - 1)` and having length `n` for the last iteration, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)` for the last iteration.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be the exact number of times the loop ran, `idx` will point right after the last processed part of `data`, `results` will contain the outcome of `func_1(a)` for every iteration, and the variables `n`, `a`, and `result` will reflect the final values used in the last iteration of the loop.
