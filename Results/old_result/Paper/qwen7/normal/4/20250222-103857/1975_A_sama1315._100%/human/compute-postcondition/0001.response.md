Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds its initial value which is an integer between 1 and 1000.
