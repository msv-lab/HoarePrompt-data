Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t indicating the number of test cases, followed by t pairs of integers. Each pair includes an integer n and a list a of n integers. For each test case, the function calls another function `func_1(a)` on the list a and collects the results. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of each test case on a new line.**
