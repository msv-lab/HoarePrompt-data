Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is `idx + n + 1`, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(a)`, `n` is an integer equal to `data[idx - n]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the slice of `data` starting from `idx - n` and having length `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`**.

Explanation: The code `result = func_1(a)` assigns the return value of the function `func_1(a)` to the variable `result`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 1, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is `idx + n + 1`, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(a)`, `n` is an integer equal to `data[idx - n]`, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from the slice of `data` starting from `idx - n` and having length `n` are still valid. The new variable `result` now holds the return value of `func_1(a)`.
