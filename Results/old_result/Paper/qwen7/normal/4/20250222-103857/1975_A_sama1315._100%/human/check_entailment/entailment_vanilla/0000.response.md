Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
This function checks if the given array `a` can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.

1. **Sorting the Array**: `sorted_a = sorted(a)` sorts the array `a`.
2. **Concatenating the Array with Itself**: `concatenated_a = a + a` creates a new array by concatenating `a` with itself.
3. **Checking Subarrays**: The loop iterates through all possible subarrays of `concatenated_a` of length equal to `sorted_a`. If any such subarray matches `sorted_a`, it returns `'Yes'`.

However, this approach is flawed because:
- It only checks if there exists a subarray in the concatenated array that matches the sorted array. This does not guarantee that the array can be split and swapped to achieve a non-decreasing order.
- For example, consider the array `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`. Sorting it gives `[1, 1, 3, 4, 5]`. Concatenating it with itself gives `[1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 1, 1, 3, 4, 5]`. The subarray `[1, 1, 3, 4, 5]` exists in the concatenated array, but the original array cannot be split and swapped to achieve a non-decreasing order.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases using `func_1`.

1. **Reading Input**: It reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: It iterates over each test case, extracts the necessary information, and calls `func_1` to get the result.
3. **Outputting Results**: It prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness Check

To determine if the program is correct, we need to ensure that `func_1` correctly identifies whether an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping.

Given the flaw in `func_1`, the program will not correctly identify arrays that can be made non-decreasing by the specified operation.

### Conclusion

Since `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, the overall program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
