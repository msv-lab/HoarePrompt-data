### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting the array into two parts and swapping them.
   - The solution uses a function `func_1` to check if the array can be sorted by comparing it with its sorted version in a concatenated form.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function takes an array `a` and checks if there exists any starting index in the concatenated version of the list (where the list is appended to itself) such that the sub-list of length equal to the sorted version of `a` is equal to the sorted version of `a`.
   - The logic is sound because if such a sub-list exists, it implies that the original array can be split and swapped to achieve a non-decreasing order.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and collects the results.
   - The results are then printed in the required format.
   - The logic here is also correct as it correctly processes each test case and prints the results.

4. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - Both functions together handle the problem correctly.
   - `func_1` checks the condition for a single array.
   - `func_2` processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` appropriately.

Given the above analysis, the program is designed to solve the problem correctly.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
