Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is `idx + n + 1`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are the return value of `func_1(a)` and the previous element, `n` is an integer equal to `data[idx - n]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the slice of `data` starting from `idx - n` and having length `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`**.

Explanation: The line `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. Initially, `results` contains one element which is the return value of `func_1(a)`. After appending `result`, `results` now contains two elements: the previous return value of `func_1(a)` and the new `result`. All other variables remain unchanged.
