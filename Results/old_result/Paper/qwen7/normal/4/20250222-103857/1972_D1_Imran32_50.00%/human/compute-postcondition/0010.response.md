Output State: **`ans` is `ans + (n + i) // ((i + 1) * (i + 1))`, `i` is `i + 2`, `root` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2`, `cnt` is `i * i`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cnt` to `i * i`. All other variables (`ans`, `i`, `root`, and the expression involving `n`, `i`, and the division) remain unchanged from their initial states.
