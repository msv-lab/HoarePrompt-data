Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to process each test case. However, the function name `func_1()` is misleading because it doesn't reflect the actual logic being implemented. A more descriptive name would be beneficial for clarity.

3. **Variable Assignment**: Inside `func_1()`, the variables `n` and `k` are assigned using `map(int, input().split())`. Since the problem specifies that the input format is `n m`, this assignment is correct. However, the variable `k` is never used in the function, which suggests there might be an error or oversight in the code.

4. **Calculation Logic**: The logic inside the loop is intended to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` based on the given conditions. Specifically, it calculates the number of integers `i` such that \(1 \leq i \leq \sqrt{n}\) and checks if \(a + i\) is divisible by \(i^2\). However, the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not directly addressed in the current implementation. Instead, the code seems to be calculating a different quantity related to the divisors of `n`.

5. **Output**: The output is printed correctly, but it does not match the expected output based on the problem statement. The current implementation does not account for the condition involving the greatest common divisor (gcd).

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
