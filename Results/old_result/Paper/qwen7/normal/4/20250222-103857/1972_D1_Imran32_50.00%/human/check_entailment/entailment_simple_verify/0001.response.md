### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Program Code Recap:
```python
import math

"""

*                      BISMILLAHIR RAHMANIR RAHEEM                         *                                                    *
**~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"""
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = n
    root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
    for i in range(2, root + 1):
        cnt = i * i
        ans += (n + i) // cnt
    print(ans)
```

#### Annotated Code Recap:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it calls `func_1()`, but the function `func_1()` is not using `m` (the second input parameter), which is incorrect.
- The function `func_1()` calculates `ans` as `n` and iterates from `2` to `root + 1` (where `root` is the square root of `n`).
- For each iteration, it calculates `cnt` as `i * i` and adds `(n + i) // cnt` to `ans`.
- Finally, it prints `ans`.

#### Correctness Check:
1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined, but it is not correctly implemented or used for the intended purpose. Specifically, it does not use `m` and only uses `n`.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The main loop processes each test case.
   - It reads `n` and `m` for each test case.
   - However, the function `func_1()` is called with `k` instead of `m`, which is incorrect because `k` is not defined in the input.

4. **Function `func_1()` Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1()` calculates `ans` as `n`.
   - It then iterates from `2` to `root + 1` (where `root` is the square root of `n`).
   - For each iteration, it calculates `cnt` as `i * i` and adds `(n + i) // cnt` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

#### Correctness of the Given Program:
- The function `func_1()` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
- The function does not use `m` at all and only uses `n`, which is incorrect.
- The logic inside `func_1()` does not match the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
