Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.

    #State: Output State: `ans` is the sum of its initial value plus the sum of \((n + i) // cnt\) for each \(i\) from 2 to the largest integer \(i\) such that \(i^2 \leq n\).
    #
    #To break it down in natural language:
    #- The variable `ans` starts with the value of `n`.
    #- For each integer `i` starting from 2 up to the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to `n`, we add \((n + i)\) divided by \(i^2\) to `ans`.
    #- The loop continues until \(i^2\) exceeds `n`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `ans` will be the initial value of `n` plus the sum of \((n + i) // i^2\) for all integers `i` from 2 to the integer part of the square root of `n` plus one.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: n + sum((n + i) // i^2 for i in range(2, int(n
