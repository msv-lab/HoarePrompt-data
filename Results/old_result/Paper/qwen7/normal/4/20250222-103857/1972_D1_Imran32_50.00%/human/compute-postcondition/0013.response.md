Output State: `ans` is the sum of its initial value plus the sum of \((n + i) // cnt\) for each \(i\) from 2 to the largest integer \(i\) such that \(i^2 \leq n\).

To break it down in natural language:
- The variable `ans` starts with the value of `n`.
- For each integer `i` starting from 2 up to the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to `n`, we add \((n + i)\) divided by \(i^2\) to `ans`.
- The loop continues until \(i^2\) exceeds `n`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `ans` will be the initial value of `n` plus the sum of \((n + i) // i^2\) for all integers `i` from 2 to the integer part of the square root of `n` plus one.
