Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(2, root + 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `root`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is `ans + (n + i) // (i)`.
   - This means `ans` was updated in the loop body using the current value of `i`.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `root + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the last value it took before the loop condition failed.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, if `i` was the last value before the loop condition failed, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged from the previous iteration because the loop body is omitted in this step.
   - `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - `root` remains unchanged.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ans` is `ans + (n + i) // (i)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `root` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`**.
