Output State: **`ans` is `ans + (n + i) // (i ** 2)`, `n` must be at least 1, `cnt` is `i` squared.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `(n + i) // cnt` to its current value. Here, `cnt` is `i` squared, so the expression becomes `(n + i) // (i ** 2)`. The values of `n` and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial state.
