### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Incorrect Function Call:**
   - The main loop calls `func_1()` with `k` instead of `m`. Since `k` is not defined, this is a clear mistake. The function should be called with `m` as the second argument.

2. **Incorrect Logic Inside `func_1()`:**
   - The function `func_1()` calculates `ans` using only `n` and does not use `m` at all. This is incorrect because the problem requires counting pairs `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ b ≤ m`.

3. **Misunderstanding of the Problem:**
   - The function `func_1()` does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not check the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program is indeed incorrect because it fails to properly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.
