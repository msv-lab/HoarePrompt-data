Output State: **`ans` is `ans + (n + i) // ((i + 1) * (i + 1))`, `i` is `i + 1`, `root` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `cnt` is `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `(n + i) // cnt` to its current value. Here, `cnt` is defined as `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`. The values of `i` and `cnt` are updated according to their respective definitions, and the conditions for `root` remain unchanged.
