Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Given Program Analysis
The provided program does not match the problem description. Let's break down the given program and compare it with the requirements:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which is the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `t` times, but the function `func_1()` is called without any parameters, which is incorrect because it should take `n` and `m` as inputs.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - `func_1()` is defined but it takes no parameters.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads `n` and `k` from the input, but `k` is not used anywhere in the function.
   - It calculates the answer using a formula that does not relate to the problem constraints.

3. **Formula Used**:
   - The formula used in the program is:
     ```python
     ans += (n + i) // cnt
     ```
   - This formula is not derived from the problem statement and does not account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Solution Approach
To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the given condition. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

### Conclusion
The given program does not implement the solution correctly. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
