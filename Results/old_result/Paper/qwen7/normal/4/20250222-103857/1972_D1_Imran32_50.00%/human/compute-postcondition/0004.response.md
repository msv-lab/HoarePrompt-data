Output State: **`n` must be at least 1; `cnt` is `i` squared.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i * i` to the variable `cnt`. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `i`, `cnt` is updated to be the square of `i`. The precondition that `n` must be at least 1 remains unchanged.
