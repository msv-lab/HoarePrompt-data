Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, `temp` is a set containing one element which is `(q + r) % n`, `r` is the integer value converted from the original string `func_1().split()[0]`, `c` is the string `func_1().split()[1]`, `temp` is a set containing one element, `m` is `m - 1`.**

Explanation: The code adds an element to the set `temp`. The element added is the result of `(q + r) % n`. Since `q` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know it is part of the expression. The value of `r` is the integer conversion of the first element split from the string returned by `func_1()`. The value of `c` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The set `temp` now contains one element, which is the result of the expression. The variable `m` is decremented by 1.
