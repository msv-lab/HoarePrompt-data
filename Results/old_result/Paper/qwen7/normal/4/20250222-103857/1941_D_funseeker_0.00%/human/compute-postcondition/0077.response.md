Postcondition: `ans` must contain at least one element, and `temp` is a set containing two elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, where `r` is an integer value converted from the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and is either '0' or '?', because `c` is either '1' or '?' as per the if condition.
