You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players (2 <= n <= 1000), m is an integer representing the number of throws (1 <= m <= 1000), x is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 <= x <= n), and ans is a set initialized with the player x. The function func_1() returns a string containing the distance r and direction c for each throw, and func_3() returns a tuple (n, m, x).
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: The final state of `ans` will be a set containing up to six unique elements after all iterations of the loop have finished. These elements are derived from applying the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` to the initial player `x` and any subsequent players added to `ans` based on the values of `r` and `c` obtained from `func_1().split()` in each iteration. The exact elements in `ans` depend on the specific values of `r` and `c` provided by `func_1()` during each iteration.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: Postcondition: `ans` is a set containing up to six unique elements derived from applying the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` to the initial player `x` and any subsequent players added to `ans` based on the values of `r` and `c` obtained from `func_1().split()` in each iteration. If `0` is present in `ans`, then `ans` will contain the element `n`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: the length of ans (which is between 1 and 7 inclusive)
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: a set of up to six unique elements, possibly including n if 0 is present in ans
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but relies on the outputs of func_1() and func_3(). It processes the distance and direction for each throw and updates the player who has the ball accordingly, returning a string that contains the updated positions after all throws.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
