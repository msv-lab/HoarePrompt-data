Output State: **`ans` is a set containing six unique elements: `(q + r) % n`, `(q - r) % n`, and the original elements from before the if-else block, where `q` is the last element processed in `ans`, `r` is an integer value converted from the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and is either '0' or '?'; `temp` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `ans = temp` assigns the value of `temp` to `ans`. Since `temp` is a set containing six unique elements, including `(q + r) % n`, `(q - r) % n`, and the original elements from before the if-else block, `ans` now holds these same elements. The value of `temp` remains unchanged.
