Postcondition: `ans` is a set containing up to six unique elements derived from applying the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` to the initial player `x` and any subsequent players added to `ans` based on the values of `r` and `c` obtained from `func_1().split()` in each iteration. If `0` is present in `ans`, then `ans` will contain the element `n`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
