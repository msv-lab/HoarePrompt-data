Output State: **`ans` is an empty set, `temp` is a set containing six unique elements: `(q + r) % n`, `(q - r) % n`, and the original elements from before the if-else block, where `q` is the last element processed in `ans`, `r` is an integer value converted from the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and is either '0' or '?'.**

In this final state, `ans` becomes an empty set because each element in `ans` has been processed exactly once, and `temp` accumulates up to six unique elements based on the conditions provided in the loop. The exact elements in `temp` depend on the values of `q`, `r`, and `c` during each iteration.
