Output State: **`ans` is equal to `temp`, `r` is the integer value converted from the original string `func_1().split()[0]`, `c` is the string `func_1().split()[1]`, `temp` is a set containing elements that are either `(q - r) % n` or `(q + r) % n` based on the conditions specified in the loop body, and `m` is now `m - 1`; `r` is now the integer value converted from the original string `func_1().split()[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `r = int(r)` converts the string `r` into an integer. Since `r` was previously an integer value converted from the string `func_1().split()[0]`, converting it back to an integer does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged.
