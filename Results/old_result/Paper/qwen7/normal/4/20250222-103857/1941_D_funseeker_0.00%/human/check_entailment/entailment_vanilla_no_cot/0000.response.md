Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after \(m\) throws. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the necessary inputs correctly using custom functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` to handle standard input operations.

2. **Initialization**: It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.

3. **Processing Throws**: For each of the \(m\) throws, it processes the distance `r` and the direction `c`. Depending on whether the direction is clockwise (`0` or `?`) or counterclockwise (`1` or `?`), it updates the set `ans` to include the possible new positions of the ball.

4. **Adjusting for Zero Index**: If the position becomes zero, it adjusts it to `n` because the players are indexed from 1 to \(n\).

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the number of possible players and their indices in sorted order.

The logic handles all the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement accurately. Therefore, the given program is correct.
