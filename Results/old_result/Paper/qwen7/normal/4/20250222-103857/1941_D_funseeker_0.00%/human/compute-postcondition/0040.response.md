Postcondition: `ans` must contain at least one element, `temp` is a set containing one element which is `(q + r) % n`, `r` is the integer value converted from the original string `func_1().split()[0]`, `c` is the string `func_1().split()[1]`, `temp` is a set containing one element, `m` is `m - 1`. This is because if `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` is updated to contain `(q + r) % n`, and `m` is decremented by 1. There is no change in `ans` and `temp` structure if `c` is neither '0' nor '?'.
