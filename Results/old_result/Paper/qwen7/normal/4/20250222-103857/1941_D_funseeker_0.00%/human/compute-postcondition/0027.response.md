Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element (excluding the first element, which was `q`), `q` is the next element from `ans`, `temp` contains an element equal to `((q - r) % n)`, `r` is the previous value of `r`.**

Explanation: The code adds an element to `temp` which is calculated as `(q - r) % n`. The value of `q` remains the same as the next element from `ans`, and `r` retains its previous value since it is not reassigned. The precondition that `ans` must contain at least one element (excluding the first element, which was `q`) and `temp` contains an element equal to `(q + r) % n` is updated to reflect the new value in `temp`.
