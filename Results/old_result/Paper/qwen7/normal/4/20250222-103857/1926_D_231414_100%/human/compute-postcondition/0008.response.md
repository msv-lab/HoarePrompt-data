Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in data:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `data`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `data` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `i` will take on the values from the list `data` one by one during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `data` must contain at least one element. If `data` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `data` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `data` is not empty.
   - The value of `i` will change with each iteration, but before the loop starts, we only need to ensure that `data` has at least one element.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `data` must be a non-empty list of integers.

Therefore, the final state is:

**`times` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `data` is a non-empty list of integers; `dic` is an empty dictionary; `ans` is 0; `check` is 2147483647.**

State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a non-empty list of integers, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `check` is 2147483647**
