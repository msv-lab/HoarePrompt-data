Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `data` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer; `dic` is an empty dictionary; `ans` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `times`, `n`, `data`, or `dic`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
