Output State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[i]`.**

In this case, the code `ans1 += a[i]` increments the value of `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. The initial state does not provide specific values for `ans1` or `a[i]`, but it indicates that `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
