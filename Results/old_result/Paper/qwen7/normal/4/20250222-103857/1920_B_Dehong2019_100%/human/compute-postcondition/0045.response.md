Output State: **`i` is `k`, `x` must be greater than `k`, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts twice the value of `a[i]` from `ans1`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated state includes `ans1` being reduced by `2 * a[i]`.
