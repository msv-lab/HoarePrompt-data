Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the list `a`.
3. It sorts the list `a` in descending order.
4. It calculates `ans1` as the sum of all elements in the sorted list `a`.
5. It then iteratively adjusts `ans1` by removing the smallest elements (doubled) up to `x` times, simulating Bob's moves.
6. After Bob's adjustments, it further adjusts `ans1` by adding back the smallest elements (up to `k` times), simulating Alice's removals.
7. At each step, it updates `ans2` to be the maximum of `ans2` and the current `ans1`.
8. Finally, it prints `ans2`.

Given the logic and the steps outlined, the program appears to correctly simulate the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob. The program accounts for all possible moves and updates the sum accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
