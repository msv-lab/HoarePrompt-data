Output State: **`ans1` is decreased by 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of list `a` plus `a[i]`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`, `i` is equal to `x-2`, `k` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: 
- The code updates `ans1` by adding the value of `a[i]` to it. Here, `i` is `x-1` from the initial state.
- Therefore, `ans1` is now `ans1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[i]`.
- Since `ans2` is equal to `ans1`, `ans2` also gets updated to the same value.
- The value of `i` is decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `x-2`.
- The conditions that `k` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0 remain unchanged.
