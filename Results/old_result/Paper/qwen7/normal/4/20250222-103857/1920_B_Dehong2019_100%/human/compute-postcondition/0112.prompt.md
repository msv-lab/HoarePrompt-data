Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. All other variables are not affected.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)
    ans1 = sum(a)
    for i in range(x):
        ans1 -= a[i] * 2
    ans2 = ans1
    for i in range(k):
        ans1 += a[i]
        if i + x < n:
            ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
        ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)
    print(ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `ans1` is decreased by 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of list `a` plus the sum of all elements from index `0` to `k-1` in list `a`, `ans2` is equal to the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is `k-1`, `k` is less than `n-x`.

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations (from `i=0` to `i=k-1`), `ans1` has been updated according to the loop's logic, which involves subtracting twice the value of each element from indices `x+i` to `k-1` from the initial decrease. The variable `ans2` keeps track of the maximum value between itself and `ans1` across all iterations. The variable `i` ends up being `k-1` after the last iteration, and `k` remains less than `n-x` to ensure the loop condition is met throughout.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `ans1` will be the sum of the first `k` elements of list `a`, adjusted according to the conditions inside the loop. `ans2` will be the maximum value between `ans1` and the initial value of `ans2`, or any updates to `ans1` during the loop iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `ans1` is the sum of elements from `a[0]` to `a[k-1]` with certain adjustments based on the value of `x`, `ans2` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` after all iterations, `i` equals `k`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `k`.

To break it down further:
- The variable `ans1` accumulates the value of elements from the list `a` starting from the beginning up to the `k-1` index, with specific subtractions based on the value of `x`.
- For each iteration `i` from `0` to `k-1`, `ans1` is incremented by `a[i]`. If `i + x` is still within the bounds of the list `a`, then `2 * a[i + x]` is subtracted from `ans1`.
- The variable `ans2` keeps track of the maximum value between `ans1` and its previous value.
- After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `k`, and `k` should be greater than or equal to `k` (which is always true as `k` is the upper limit of the loop).

This final state reflects the complete computation performed by the loop over all iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
