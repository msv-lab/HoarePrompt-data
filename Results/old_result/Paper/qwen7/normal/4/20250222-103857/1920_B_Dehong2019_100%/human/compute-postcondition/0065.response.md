Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < k`.

3. **Analyze the operations inside the loop**:
   - `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`.
   - `ans2` is updated to be the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 (`i += 1`).
   - If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is further decreased by `a[i + x] * 2`, and `ans2` remains the maximum of the updated `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - If `i + x >= n`, no additional changes are made to `ans1` and `ans2`.

4. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`.
   - `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.
   - If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is further decreased by `a[i + x] * 2`, and `ans2` remains the maximum of the updated `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - If `i + x >= n`, no additional changes are made to `ans1` and `ans2`.

5. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `k`. Therefore, `i + 1` must be less than `k`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `ans1` and `ans2` remain the same unless `i + x < n`, in which case `ans1` is decreased by `a[i + x] * 2`.
   - `i` is increased by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i + 1 < k`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is `i + 1`, if `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is further decreased by `a[i + x] * 2`, and `ans2` remains the maximum of the updated `ans1` and `ans2`, `i + 1` must be less than `k`**.
