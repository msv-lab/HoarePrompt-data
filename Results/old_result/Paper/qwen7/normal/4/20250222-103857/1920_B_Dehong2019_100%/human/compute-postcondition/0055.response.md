Output State: **`ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`, `i` and `x` are such that their sum is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`. Since `i` and `x` are such that their sum is less than `n`, the condition remains unchanged. The value of `a[i + x]` is multiplied by 2 and then subtracted from `ans1`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `n` remain as per the initial condition.
