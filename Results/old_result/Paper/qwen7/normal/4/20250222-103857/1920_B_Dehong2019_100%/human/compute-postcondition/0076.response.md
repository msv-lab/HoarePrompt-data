Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans2` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 = sum(a)` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to `ans1`. The list `a` remains unchanged, and `ans2` retains its original value of 0.
