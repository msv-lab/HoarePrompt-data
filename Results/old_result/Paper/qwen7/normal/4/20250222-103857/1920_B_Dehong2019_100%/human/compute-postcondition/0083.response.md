Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < x`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.
   - `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus four times the element at index 2.
   - `ans2` is 0.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `x` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged because it is a condition for the loop to continue, but it must still be greater than 0.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `a` remains the same (a sorted list of integers in descending order).
   - `ans1` remains the same (the sum of all elements in `a` minus four times the element at index 2).
   - `ans2` remains 0.
   - `i` is now 3.
   - `x` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus four times the element at index 2, `ans2` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` must be greater than 0**
