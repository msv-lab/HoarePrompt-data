Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input.
   - `i` is equal to `n + 1`.
   - `s` is an empty set (`set()`).
   - `ans` is 1 if `n` is 2; otherwise, `ans` is the result of performing the XOR operation on 1 for each iteration where `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is not greater than 1. If `ans` is true, then `i` is 3; otherwise, `i` is 4.

3. **Adjust the States for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Since `i` is initially set to `n + 1`, the loop will not execute as written because `i` is greater than `n`.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be within the range `[0, n)`. This means `i` should be adjusted to be between 0 and `n` (inclusive).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

State: **`i` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `n` is a valid integer**
