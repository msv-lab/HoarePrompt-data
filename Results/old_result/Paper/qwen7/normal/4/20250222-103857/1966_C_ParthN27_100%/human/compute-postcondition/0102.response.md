Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `i + 2` (This means `i` was incremented by 2 in the previous iteration).
   - `s` is a set containing the elements `arr[i+1]` and `arr[i]`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `ans` is 1.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was incremented by 2 in the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 (since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs).
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
   - `s` will be updated based on the new value of `i`, but since the problem only asks us to adjust the state of objects in the loop head, we don't need to change `s` here.
   - `ans` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `i + 1` (since `i` was `i + 2` before and the loop increments `i` by 1).
- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `s` and `ans` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `s` is a set containing the elements `arr[i+1]` and `arr[i]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is 1**
