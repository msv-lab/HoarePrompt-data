Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. Therefore, at the start of each iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `3`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no modification of `n` is mentioned, it stays the same.

5. **Postconditions**:
   - The postcondition `if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` results in breaking out of the loop or setting `ans = ans ^ 1` if the condition is not met.
   - Since `i` is 2 at the end of the previous iteration, the condition `s[3] - s[2] > 1` will be checked in the next iteration (when `i` becomes 3).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
