Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a sorted list containing all elements from the list `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(s)` calculates the length of the list `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of `i`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still equal to `n` (which is now the length of `s`), `s` remains a sorted list with an additional 0 at the beginning, and `ans` is still 1.
