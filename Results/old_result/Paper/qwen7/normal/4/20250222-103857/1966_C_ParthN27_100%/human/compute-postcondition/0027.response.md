Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is equal to the length of list `s`, `s` is a list containing [0] followed by the sorted elements of `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, `ans` is 0, and `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1**

Explanation: The line `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `ans` and 1. Initially, `ans` is 1. The XOR operation flips the bits of `ans`. Since `1 ^ 1` equals `0`, `ans` is now `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.
