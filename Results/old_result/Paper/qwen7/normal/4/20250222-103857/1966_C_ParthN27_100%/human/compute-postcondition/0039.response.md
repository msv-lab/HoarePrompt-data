Output State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is equal to the length of list `s`, `s` is a list containing [0] followed by the sorted elements of `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, and `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on the number of times the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` was false during the loop iterations. The loop continues until `i` reaches `n-1` or the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` is met, causing the loop to break. If the condition is never met, `ans` will be `1` if `n-1` is odd and `0` if `n-1` is even.
