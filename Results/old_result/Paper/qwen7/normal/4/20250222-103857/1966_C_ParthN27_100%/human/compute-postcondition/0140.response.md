Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a sorted list of all unique elements from the list `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `n` is the length of `s`, and `ans` is 1. If the length of `s` is 2, the postcondition remains as described. If the length of `s` is not 2, `i` is 3, and `ans` remains 1.
