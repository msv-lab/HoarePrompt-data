Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a sorted list containing all elements from the list `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `ans` is 1.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 1. This does not affect the values of `i` or `s`. Therefore, `i` remains equal to `n`, `s` remains a sorted list containing all elements from the list `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, and `ans` is set to 1.
