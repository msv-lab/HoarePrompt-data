Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is equal to the length of list `s`.
   - `s` is a list containing [0] followed by the sorted elements of `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`.
   - If `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is greater than 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 0 and `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `n - 1`, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`, which means `i` will be 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is determined by the length of the list `s`.

4. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` remains the same, which is the length of list `s`.
   - `s` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop head.
   - The condition `s[i] - s[i - 1]` needs to be checked again, but since the loop continues based on the value of `i`, we don't need to specify the value of `s[i] - s[i - 1]` explicitly unless it changes.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is equal to the length of list `s`, `s` is a list containing [0] followed by the sorted elements of `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`**.
