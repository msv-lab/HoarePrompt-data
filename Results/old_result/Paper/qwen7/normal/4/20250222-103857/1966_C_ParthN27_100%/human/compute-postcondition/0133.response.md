Output State: **i is 3, n is the length of s, ans is 1.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be 3 (since the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n-1` and stops either when `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` or when all iterations are completed). The value of `n` remains the length of `s`, as it is not modified within the loop. The value of `ans` is 1 because each iteration of the loop toggles `ans` between 0 and 1, and since the loop runs 3 times, `ans` will end up being 1 (starting from 1 and toggling twice results in 1).
