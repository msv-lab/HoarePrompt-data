Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` indicating the number of piles, followed by `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. It then determines whether Alice or Bob wins based on the sorted unique values of the stones in the piles. If the length of the sorted unique values is 2, it prints 'Alice'. Otherwise, it checks if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1; if so, it prints 'Alice', otherwise it prints 'Bob'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
