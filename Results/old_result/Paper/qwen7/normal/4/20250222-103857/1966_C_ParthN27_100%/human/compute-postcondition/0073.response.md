Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and `ans` is 0 if it was 1, or 1 if it was 0.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is being XORed with 1. XORing a variable with 1 will toggle its value. If `ans` was 1, it becomes 0; if `ans` was 0, it becomes 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
