Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: n, a, and b. For each test case, if n is greater than 1, it calculates two values, ans1 (which is a * n) and ans2 (which is b * n // 2 + a * n % 2), then prints the minimum of these two values. If n is 1 or less, it simply prints the value of a. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
