Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `ans1` is calculated as `a * n`.
- `ans2` is calculated as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.

We need to determine the value of `min(ans1, ans2)`.

To do this, let's break down the expressions for `ans1` and `ans2`:

1. `ans1 = a * n`
2. `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`

The expression `n // 2` gives the integer division of `n` by 2, and `n % 2` gives the remainder when `n` is divided by 2. 

- If `n` is even, then `n % 2` is 0, so `ans2 = b * n / 2`.
- If `n` is odd, then `n % 2` is 1, so `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a`.

In both cases, `ans2` will be compared with `ans1` to find the minimum value.

Given the general form, the output will depend on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `n`. However, since the exact values of these variables are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the variables.

Output: **min(a * n, b * n // 2 + a * n % 2)**
