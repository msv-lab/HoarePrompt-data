You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: n, a, and b. For each test case, if n is greater than 1, it calculates two values, ans1 (which is a * n) and ans2 (which is b * n // 2 + a * n % 2), then prints the minimum of these two values. If n is 1 or less, it simply prints the value of a. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Base Case Handling:**
   - If `n` is 1, the program directly prints `a` (the price of one yogurt), which is correct because buying one yogurt at the regular price is the only option.

3. **Promotion Calculation:**
   - For `n > 1`, the program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1`: The total cost if each yogurt is bought at the regular price (`a * n`).
     - `ans2`: The total cost if the maximum number of pairs of yogurts are bought at the promotion price (`b * n // 2`), and any remaining single yogurt is bought at the regular price (`a * n % 2`).

4. **Minimum Cost Determination:**
   - The program correctly determines the minimum cost between `ans1` and `ans2` using `min(ans1, ans2)`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is correct according to the problem statement.

### Verification with Example Inputs:

Let's verify the program with the provided example inputs:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
  - `ans2 = 9 * 2 / 2 + 5 * 2 % 2 = 9 + 5 = 14`
  - Minimum cost: `min(10, 14) = 9`

- **Test Case 2:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 9 * 3 / 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 13 + 5 = 18`
  - Minimum cost: `min(15, 18) = 15`

- **Test Case 3:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 11 * 3 / 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 16 + 5 = 17`
  - Minimum cost: `min(15, 17) = 15`

- **Test Case 4:** `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
  - `ans2 = 11 * 4 / 2 + 5 * 4 % 2 = 22 + 5 = 22`
  - Minimum cost: `min(20, 22) = 20`

The program produces the correct outputs for all the example inputs.
