Output State: **`t` must be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer, `b` is the third input integer, `ans1` is \(a \times n\), `ans2` is \(b \times n // 2 + a \times n \% 2\), the next input value must be greater than 0, `ans1` is updated to \(a \times n\)**.

Explanation: The code updates `ans1` to be the product of `a` and `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
