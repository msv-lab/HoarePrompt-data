Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts under the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each test case, it calculates the total cost without any promotion (`ans1 = a * n`).
   - It also calculates the total cost using the promotion (`ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`). This formula accounts for the fact that for every pair of yogurts, the cost is `b`, and if there's an odd number of yogurts left, the last yogurt will be bought at the regular price `a`.
3. **Comparison and Output**: The program then prints the minimum of these two calculated costs.

This approach ensures that the program considers both the regular price and the promotional price to find the minimum cost. The logic handles all edge cases, such as when `n` is less than or equal to 1, where the cost is simply `a`.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program correctly computes the minimum cost for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
