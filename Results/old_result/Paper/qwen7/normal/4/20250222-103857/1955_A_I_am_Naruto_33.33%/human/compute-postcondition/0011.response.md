Output State: **`t` must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n, a, b` are assigned the values from the input, `ans1` is `a * n` and `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` if `n` is greater than 1.**

This means that the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values provided by the input. Additionally, if `n` is greater than 1, then `ans1` and `ans2` are calculated based on the given formulas.
