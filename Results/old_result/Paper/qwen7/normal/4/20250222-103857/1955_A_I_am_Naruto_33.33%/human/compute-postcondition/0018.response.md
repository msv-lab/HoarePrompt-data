Output State: **`t` must be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer, `b` is the third input integer, `ans1` is \(a \times n\), `ans2` is \(b \times n // 2 + a \times n \% 2\), the next input value must be greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are now assigned the values from the input split into integers.**

This means that the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` have been updated to the integers provided by the input, while `t`, `ans1`, and `ans2` retain their original conditions and expressions.
