Given the initial state and the code snippet:

- `t` is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `a` is the second input integer.
- `b` is the third input integer.
- `ans1` is \(a \times n\).
- `ans2` is \(b \times n // 2 + a \times n \% 2\).
- The next input value must be greater than 0, and `ans2` is updated to \(b \times n // 2 + a \times n \% 2\).

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print(min(ans1, ans2))` executes.

First, let's break down the expressions for `ans1` and `ans2`:

- `ans1 = a * n`
- `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`

The expression `n // 2` gives the integer division of `n` by 2, and `n % 2` gives the remainder when `n` is divided by 2.

Let's consider the possible values of `n % 2`:
- If `n` is even, `n % 2` is 0.
- If `n` is odd, `n % 2` is 1.

Thus, `ans2` can be simplified as follows:
- If `n` is even, `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * 0 = b * (n // 2)`
- If `n` is odd, `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * 1 = b * (n // 2) + a`

Now, we need to find the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`:

- If `n` is even, `ans2 = b * (n // 2)`
- If `n` is odd, `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a`

To determine which is smaller between `ans1` and `ans2`, we compare `a * n` with `b * (n // 2)` if `n` is even, and with `b * (n // 2) + a` if `n` is odd.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `ans1` and `ans2`. However, we know that `ans1` is always `a * n`, and `ans2` depends on whether `n` is even or odd.

Therefore, the output will be the minimum of these two values.

Output: **min(a * n, b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2))**
