Output: **a (where a is an input integer)**

Explanation: 
- The initial state tells us that `n` is less than or equal to 1.
- Since `n` is less than or equal to 1, the value of `a` is not affected by any conditions involving `n`.
- Therefore, the `print(a)` statement will simply print the value of `a`, which is an input integer.
