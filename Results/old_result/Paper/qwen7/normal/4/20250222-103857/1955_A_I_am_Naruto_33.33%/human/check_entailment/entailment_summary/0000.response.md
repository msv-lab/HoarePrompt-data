Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the case when `n` is 1 or less by printing the price of a single yogurt (`a`).
2. For cases where `n` is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs:
   - `ans1 = a * n`: This represents the cost if each yogurt is bought individually.
   - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`: This represents the cost if pairs of yogurts are bought under the promotion, with any remaining single yogurt bought at the regular price.
3. The program then prints the minimum of these two calculated values, which ensures that Maxim spends the least amount of money.
4. The logic for calculating `ans2` is correct because:
   - `b * n // 2` accounts for the cost of as many pairs of yogurts as possible.
   - `a * n % 2` accounts for the cost of any remaining single yogurt after forming as many pairs as possible.
5. The program processes each test case correctly without any apparent errors.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
