Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer equal to the first input split by space.
- `k` is an integer equal to 1.
- The program continues the loop with `k` greater than 2 times `n`.

We need to determine the value of `k // 2 + 1` when the print statement is executed.

Given:
- `k = 1`
- `2 * n` would be twice the value of `n`.

Since the loop continues with `k` greater than `2 * n`, it means that `k` must be greater than `2 * n`. However, initially, `k` is set to 1. Therefore, the condition `k > 2 * n` implies that `n` must be very small (specifically, `n` must be 0 or 1 because if `n` were 2 or more, `k` would never start as 1 and still satisfy the condition).

Let's consider the smallest possible value for `n` which is 0:
- If `n = 0`, then `2 * n = 0`, and `k = 1` is indeed greater than `0`.

Thus, `k` is 1, and we need to evaluate `k // 2 + 1`:
- `k // 2` is `1 // 2`, which is 0 (integer division).
- Adding 1 to 0 gives us 1.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **1**
