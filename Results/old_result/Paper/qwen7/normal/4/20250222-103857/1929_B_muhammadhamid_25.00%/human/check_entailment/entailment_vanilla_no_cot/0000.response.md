Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all test cases. Let's analyze why:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - For \( k \leq 2n \):
     - The solution correctly calculates the minimum number of cells needed using `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
   - For \( k > 2n \):
     - The solution incorrectly prints `k // 2 + 1` instead of considering the optimal placement of cells to minimize the number of colored cells.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - For \( k \leq 2n \), coloring cells along the main diagonal and anti-diagonal can achieve the required \( k \) diagonals with the minimum number of cells.
   - For \( k > 2n \), we need to consider the placement of additional cells to cover the remaining diagonals efficiently.

Let's provide a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of cells needed
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            # For k > 2n, we need to place additional cells
            # The optimal strategy is to place cells such that they cover the remaining diagonals
            # We need to cover 2n diagonals already covered by the main and anti-diagonals
            # So we need to place additional cells to cover the remaining (k - 2n) diagonals
            additional_cells = max(0, k - 2 * n)
            print(n + additional_cells)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected solution ensures that for \( k > 2n \), it places the minimum number of additional cells to cover the remaining diagonals efficiently.
