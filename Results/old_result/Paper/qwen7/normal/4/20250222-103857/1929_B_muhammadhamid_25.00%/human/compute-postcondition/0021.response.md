Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer equal to the second input split by space.
- `k` is an integer equal to the first input split by space.
- The number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(math.ceil(k / 2))
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `math.ceil(k / 2)` expression calculates the ceiling of `k / 2`. This means it rounds up to the nearest integer if `k / 2` is not already an integer.
2. Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we need to consider the general case where `k` is an integer.
3. The `math.ceil()` function will round up `k / 2` to the next integer if `k` is odd, or leave it as is if `k` is even.

Given the precondition, the exact value of `k` is not specified, but we know it is an integer. Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `k`.

Output: **math.ceil(k / 2) (where k is the first input split by space)**
