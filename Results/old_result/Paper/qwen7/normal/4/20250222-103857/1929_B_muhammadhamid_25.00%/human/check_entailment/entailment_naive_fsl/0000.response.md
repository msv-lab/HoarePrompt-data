Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to provide the correct minimum number of cells to color for certain values of \( n \) and \( k \).

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `3 10`
- Expected Output: `6`

However, the program outputs `5` instead of `6`. This is because the program logic does not correctly account for the minimum number of cells needed when \( k \) is greater than \( 2n \). The program calculates the result using `k // 2 + 1`, which is incorrect for this specific case.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of cells required for all cases, especially when \( k > 2n \). A more accurate approach would involve a different calculation that takes into account the structure of the diagonals in the grid.
