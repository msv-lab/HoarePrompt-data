Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer equal to the second input split by space.
- `k` is an integer equal to the first input split by space.
- The number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 5`.
- If `k` equals 1, the number of iterations left remains unchanged from `int(input()) - 4`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(k // 2 + 1)`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The number of iterations left is derived from user input. For simplicity, let's denote the user input as `user_input`. The number of iterations left is `int(user_input) - 5` if `k` is not 1, and `int(user_input) - 4` if `k` is 1.

2. **Value of `k`**: The value of `k` is determined by the first input split by space. Let's denote this value as `k_value`.

3. **Expression Evaluation**: The expression `k // 2 + 1` will be evaluated based on the value of `k_value`.

   - If `k_value` is 1, then the number of iterations left is `int(user_input) - 4`. However, the value of `k_value` itself does not affect the number of iterations left; it only affects the expression evaluation.
   - If `k_value` is any other value (e.g., 2, 3, 4, ...), the number of iterations left is `int(user_input) - 5`.

4. **Expression Simplification**:
   - If `k_value` is 1, the expression becomes `1 // 2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.
   - If `k_value` is any other value, the expression becomes `k_value // 2 + 1`.

Since the exact value of `k_value` is not specified, we need to consider both cases:

- If `k_value` is 1, the output is `1`.
- If `k_value` is any other value, the output is `k_value // 2 + 1`.

Given the problem constraints and the need to provide a precise answer, we should consider the general case where `k_value` is not necessarily 1.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **k_value // 2 + 1 (where k_value is the first input split by space)**
