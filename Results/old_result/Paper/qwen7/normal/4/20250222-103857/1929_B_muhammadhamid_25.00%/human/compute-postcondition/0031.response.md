Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer equal to the second input split by space.
- `k` is an integer equal to the first input split by space.
- The number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 5`.
- If `k` equals 1, the number of iterations left remains unchanged from `int(input()) - 4`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(math.ceil(k / 2))
```

Let's break down the steps:

1. The value of `k` is determined by the first input split by space.
2. The `math.ceil(k / 2)` expression calculates the ceiling of `k / 2`, which means it rounds up to the nearest integer if `k / 2` is not already an integer.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we need to consider both cases:

- If `k` is even, `k / 2` is an integer, and `math.ceil(k / 2)` will simply return `k / 2`.
- If `k` is odd, `k / 2` is a non-integer, and `math.ceil(k / 2)` will round up to the next integer.

Given the conditions provided, the exact value of `k` does not affect the final output since the print statement only depends on `k` and not on the number of iterations left or any other variable.

Therefore, the output will be the ceiling of `k / 2`.

Output: **math.ceil(k / 2) (where k is the first input split by space)**
