Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the second input split by space, `k` is an integer equal to the first input split by space, the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1` before the `continue` statement, after executing the `continue` statement, the number of iterations left will be reduced by 1, making it `int(input()) - 2`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
