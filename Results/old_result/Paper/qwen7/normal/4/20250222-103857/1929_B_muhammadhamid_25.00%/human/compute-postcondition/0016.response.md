Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the second input split by space, `k` is an integer equal to the first input split by space, the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial value of `n` was an integer equal to the first input split by space, and the initial value of `k` was an integer equal to 1. After executing the code, `n` is updated to the second input split by space, and `k` is updated to the first input split by space. The number of iterations left remains as `int(input()) - 1`.
