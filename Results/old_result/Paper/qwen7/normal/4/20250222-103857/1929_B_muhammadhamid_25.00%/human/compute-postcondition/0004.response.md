Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input split by space, `k` is an integer equal to 1 and we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect the variables `n` and `k`. The value of `k` remains 1 as per the initial state, and the program continues to the next iteration (if there was a loop) or exits the function (if there was no loop).
