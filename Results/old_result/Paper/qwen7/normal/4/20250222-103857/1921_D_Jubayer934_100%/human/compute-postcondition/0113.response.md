Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n-1`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the corresponding element in `b`

The print statement `print(sum(ans))` will calculate the sum of all elements in the list `ans`.

Since `i` is equal to `n-1`, it implies that the loop has completed its iterations, and `ans` contains the required absolute differences. However, the specific values in `a` and `b` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact numerical sum of `ans`.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b`.

Output: **sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b`**
