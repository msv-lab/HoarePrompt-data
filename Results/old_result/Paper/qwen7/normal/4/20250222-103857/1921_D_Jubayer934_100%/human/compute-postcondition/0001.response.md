Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, splits them, and converts each to an integer before assigning them to `n` and `m`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer within the range 1 to 100.
