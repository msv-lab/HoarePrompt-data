Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `temp` is `i + 1`, `ans` is a list that now includes the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `temp`. Since `i` was previously `i + 1`, `temp` is also set to `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The `ans` list still contains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, which was calculated before this line of code.
