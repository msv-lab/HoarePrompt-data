Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from user input, `b` is a sorted list of the `m` largest integers from user input in descending order, `i` is `n - 1`, `temp` is `i`, `ans` is an empty list, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from user input, `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The line `temp = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is `n - 1`) to the variable `temp`. All other variables remain unchanged.
