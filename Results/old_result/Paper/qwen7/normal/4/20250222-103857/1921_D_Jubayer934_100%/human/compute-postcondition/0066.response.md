Output State: **`ans` is updated with the value of `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to the list `ans`. However, since no specific values for `a`, `b`, `i`, or `n` are given, we cannot determine the exact value that is appended to `ans`. We only know that `ans` has been updated with this new value, while `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.
