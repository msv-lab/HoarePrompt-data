Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `temp` is `i + 1`, `ans` is a list that now includes the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. Since `i` was previously `i + 1`, it is now updated to `i + 1`. The other variables (`temp` and `n`) remain unchanged, and the condition for appending the maximum absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` or `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` remains intact.
