Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `b` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is an index within the range of both lists.
   - `temp` is equal to `i`.
   - `ans` is a list that has appended the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was used in the loop, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `temp` will also be `i + 1` because `temp` is equal to `i`.
   - `ans` will have one more element, which is the absolute difference between `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `a` remains a list of integers.
- `b` remains a list of integers.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `i + 1`.
- `temp` is updated to `i + 1`.
- `ans` now contains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for the previous value of `i`, and will append the new difference for the next value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `temp` is `i + 1`, `ans` is a list that has appended the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`**.
