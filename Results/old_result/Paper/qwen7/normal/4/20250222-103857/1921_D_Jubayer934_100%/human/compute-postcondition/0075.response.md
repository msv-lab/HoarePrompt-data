Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from user input, `b` is a sorted list of the `m` largest integers from user input in descending order, `i` is -1, `temp` is `n - 1`, and `n` and `m` are integers obtained from user input.**

The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `temp` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new values of `n` and `m` are stored in the variables `n` and `m`, respectively.
