Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `temp` is `i + 1`, `ans` is a list that now includes the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no explicit loop or conditional block mentioned in the code snippet, the `break` statement is likely breaking out of a loop that was previously implied. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `temp`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their previous states, and the `break` statement indicates that we are exiting the loop or conditional block.
