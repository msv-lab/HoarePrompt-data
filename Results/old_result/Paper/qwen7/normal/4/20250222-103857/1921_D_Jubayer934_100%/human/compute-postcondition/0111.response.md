Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the corresponding element in `b`. If `temp` is less than or equal to `n-1` and has been decremented to its final value during the last iteration, then `i` equals `temp`.
