Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution attempts to solve the problem but contains several logical errors and inefficiencies. Here's a detailed breakdown of why it is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Choosing Elements**:
   - The code tries to decide whether to use `b[i]` or `b[-(n - i)]` for each element in `a`. However, the logic used to decide which one to use is flawed. It checks if using `b[-(n - i)]` gives a larger absolute difference than using `b[i]`, but this decision is made for just one element (`temp`) and then applied to the rest without considering the overall goal of maximizing the total difference.

2. **Sorting and Selection**:
   - While sorting both arrays `a` and `b` is a good idea, the way the elements are selected and appended to `ans` is incorrect. The code should aim to maximize the differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b`.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final summation of differences is done correctly, but the preceding steps to form `ans` are flawed.

### Correct Approach:

A better approach would involve sorting both arrays and then pairing the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` and vice versa to maximize the differences. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)
        
        # Pair smallest elements of a with largest elements of b
        diff = sum(abs(a[i] - b[i]) for i in range(n))
        
        print(diff)

# Example usage
func()
```

This approach ensures that the differences are maximized by always pairing the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b`, and vice versa, which aligns with the problem's requirement to maximize the total difference.
