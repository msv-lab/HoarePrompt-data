Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `temp` is -1.**

The code initializes `temp` to -1, which does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `m`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
