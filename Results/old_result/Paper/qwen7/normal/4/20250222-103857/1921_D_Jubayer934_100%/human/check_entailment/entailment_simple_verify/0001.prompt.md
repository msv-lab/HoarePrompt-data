You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

    #State: After all iterations, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `temp` is either `-1` or its final value determined during the loop, and `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the corresponding element in `b`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the sizes of arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It then reads `n` integers into array `a` and `m` integers into array `b`.

2. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - Array `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - Array `b` is sorted in descending order.

3. **Initialization:**
   - A variable `temp` is initialized to `-1` to track if a swap is needed.
   - An empty list `ans` is created to store the differences.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the first `n` elements of the sorted `b` array.
   - For each element in `a`, it calculates the absolute difference with the corresponding element in the sorted `b` array.
   - If at any point, swapping the current element in `a` with the corresponding element in `b` results in a larger difference, it updates `temp` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it appends the calculated difference to `ans`.

5. **Handling Swaps:**
   - If `temp` is updated, the program enters a second loop to handle the remaining elements in `a` by swapping them with the appropriate elements in `b` from the end.

6. **Summing Differences:**
   - Finally, it sums up all the differences stored in `ans` and prints the result.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - Sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order ensures that we consider the best possible match for minimizing the differences initially.

2. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The logic for checking if a swap is beneficial is flawed. The condition `if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is incorrect because it doesn't guarantee the maximum difference. Instead, it should ensure that the largest possible values in `b` are matched with the smallest possible values in `a`.

3. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - The handling of remaining elements after the initial loop is also incorrect. The logic for appending differences should directly use the sorted `b` array without needing to recompute.

### Correct Solution Approach:

A more straightforward approach would be to pair the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` and vice versa to maximize the differences.

### Revised Program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)
        ans = 0
        for i in range(n):
            ans += abs(a[i] - b[i])
        print(ans)
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has logical flaws in its approach to maximize the differences. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
