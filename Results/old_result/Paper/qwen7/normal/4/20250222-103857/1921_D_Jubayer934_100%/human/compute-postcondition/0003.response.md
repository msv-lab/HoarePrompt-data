Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `ans`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, or `temp`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and a new variable `ans` is introduced as an empty list.
