Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from user input, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `n - 1`, `temp` is `-1`, `ans` is an empty list, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input, converts them to integers, sorts them, and assigns the first `n` elements of this sorted list to `a`. The other variables (`b`, `i`, `temp`, `ans`, `n`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
