Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of both lists, and `temp` is equal to `i`. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If not, the same conditions hold as they did before the if-else block executed.
