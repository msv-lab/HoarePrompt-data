Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the sizes of arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It then reads `n` integers into array `a` and `m` integers into array `b`.

2. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - Array `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - Array `b` is sorted in descending order.

3. **Initialization:**
   - A variable `temp` is initialized to `-1` to track if a swap is needed.
   - An empty list `ans` is created to store the differences.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the first `n` elements of the sorted `b` array.
   - For each element in `a`, it calculates the absolute difference with the corresponding element in the sorted `b` array.
   - If at any point, swapping the current element in `a` with the corresponding element in `b` results in a larger difference, it updates `temp` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it appends the calculated difference to `ans`.

5. **Handling Swaps:**
   - If `temp` is updated, the program enters a second loop to handle the remaining elements in `a` by swapping them with the appropriate elements in `b` from the end.

6. **Summing Differences:**
   - Finally, it sums up all the differences stored in `ans` and prints the result.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - Sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order ensures that we consider the best possible match for minimizing the differences initially.

2. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The logic for checking if a swap is beneficial is flawed. The condition `if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is incorrect because it doesn't guarantee the maximum difference. Instead, it should ensure that the largest possible values in `b` are matched with the smallest possible values in `a`.

3. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - The handling of remaining elements after the initial loop is also incorrect. The logic for appending differences should directly use the sorted `b` array without needing to recompute.

### Correct Solution Approach:

A more straightforward approach would be to pair the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` and vice versa to maximize the differences.

### Revised Program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)
        ans = 0
        for i in range(n):
            ans += abs(a[i] - b[i])
        print(ans)
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has logical flaws in its approach to maximize the differences. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
