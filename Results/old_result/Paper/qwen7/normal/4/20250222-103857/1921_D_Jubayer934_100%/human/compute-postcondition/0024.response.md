Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `temp` is `i + 1`, `ans` is a list that now includes the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`**.

Explanation: The code snippet appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. Since the condition to append the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` if it is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` is not met (as it is only checking against `b[i]`), `ans` is updated with the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
