Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from user input, `b` is a sorted list of the `m` largest integers from user input in descending order, `i` is `n - 1`, `temp` is `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not affect the values of the variables `a`, `b`, `i`, `temp`, or `ans`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous values, and the only change is that the program breaks out of the loop or conditional block it was in.
