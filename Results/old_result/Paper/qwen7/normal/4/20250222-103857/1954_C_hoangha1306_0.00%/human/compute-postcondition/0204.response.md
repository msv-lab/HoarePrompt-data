Postcondition: `vt` is 1, `kq1` is either 'None' plus the string representation of `x` or the concatenation of `kq1` and the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is either an empty string plus the string representation of `y` or the concatenation of the previous value of `kq2` and the string representation of `x`.
