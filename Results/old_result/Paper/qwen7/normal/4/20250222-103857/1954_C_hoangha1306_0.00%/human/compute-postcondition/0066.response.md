Postcondition: `a` and `b` are lists of integers with the same length, `kq1` is a string that contains the concatenation of the string representations of `a[i]` and the previous value of `kq1`, `kq2` is a string that contains the concatenation of the string representation of `a[i]` with its previous value if `a[i] == b[i]`, otherwise it is updated by appending the string representation of the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])` to its current value, `vt` is either set to 1 or is not equal to 0, `i` is `n + 2`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. If `vt == 0` and `a[i] > b[i]`, then `kq1` is updated by appending the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `y`. If `vt == 0` and `a[i] <= b[i]`, then `kq1` is updated by appending the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `x`. If `vt != 0`, then `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `x` to its current value.
