Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `len(a)` is the length of the input string `a`, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + a[i]`, `kq2` is `kq2 + a[i]`, `kq2` is unchanged, `vt` is 1 if it was 0, `q` is `q + 1` and is now less than `t`, `b` is the newly input string, `a` is the input string from the user, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))**.

This means that the value of `kq2` has been updated to its previous value plus `a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states, with the exception of `i`, which has been incremented by 1, and `kq2`, which has been updated accordingly.
