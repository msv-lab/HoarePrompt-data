Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 and is now less than `t`, `len(a)` is the length of the input string `a`, `kq1` is concatenated with `a[i]`, `kq2` is concatenated with `a[i]`, `vt` is 1 if it was 0, `q` is incremented by 1 and is now less than `t`, `b` is the newly input string, `a` is the input string from the user, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))**, and we continue the loop.

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead moves the control to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of all the variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement.
