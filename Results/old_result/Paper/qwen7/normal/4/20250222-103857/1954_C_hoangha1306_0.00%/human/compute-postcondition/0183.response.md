Output State: **`vt` is 1, `kq1` is 'None+x', `kq2` is an empty string plus the string representation of `y`.**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `vt` is 1 and `kq1` is 'None+x'. The line of code `kq2 = kq2 + str(y)` attempts to concatenate `kq2` with the string representation of `y`. However, since `kq2` is not defined before this line, it is treated as an empty string. Therefore, `kq2` is updated to be the string representation of `y`. The values of `vt` and `kq1` remain unchanged.
