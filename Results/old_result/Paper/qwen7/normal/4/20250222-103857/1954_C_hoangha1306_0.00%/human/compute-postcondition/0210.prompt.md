Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0, `q` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `t`, `b` is the newly input string, `a` is the input string from the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `t`, `len(a)` is the length of the input string `a`, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings where if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, `kq1` remains unchanged and `kq2` remains unchanged; if `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, `kq1` is updated to the concatenation of `kq1` and either the string representation of `x` or `y` depending on which is greater, and `kq2` is updated to the string representation of the greater value between `x` and `y`; `vt` is 1 if it was 0 and `q` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `t`, `b` is the newly input string, `a` is the input string from the user, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is incremented by 1 and is now less than `t`, `len(a)` is the length of the input string `a`, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])` (either concatenating the string representation of the maximum value to the original `kq1` or setting it to 'None+x', and concatenating the string representation of the minimum value to the original `kq2` or setting it to an empty string plus the string representation of `y`), `vt` is 1 if it was 0, `q` is incremented by 1 and is now less than `t`, `b` is the newly input string, `a` is the input string from the user, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is incremented by 1, `len(a)` remains the same, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `vt` is 1 if it was 0, `q` is incremented by 1 and is now less than `t`, `b` is the newly input string, `a` is the input string from the user, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, then `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + a[i]` and `kq2` remains unchanged. If they are not equal, `kq1` is updated to either 'None' followed by the string representations of `x` and `y` (if `vt` was 0) or the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`. Similarly, `kq2` is updated to either the string representations of `y` and `x` (if `vt` was 0) or the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
