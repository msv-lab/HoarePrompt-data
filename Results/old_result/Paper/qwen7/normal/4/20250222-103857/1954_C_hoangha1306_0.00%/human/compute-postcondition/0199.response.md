Output State: **`vt` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `vt = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `vt`. Since no other variables are affected by this line of code, the only change is that `vt` is now explicitly set to 1. All other variables retain their previous states as per the initial conditions.
