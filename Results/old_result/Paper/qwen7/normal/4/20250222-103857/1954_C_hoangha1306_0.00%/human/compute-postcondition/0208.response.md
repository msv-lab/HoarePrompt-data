Postcondition: **`vt` is 1, `kq1` is a string containing 'None' followed by the string representations of `x` and `y` if `vt` was 0, otherwise `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`. `kq2` is a string containing the string representations of `y` and `x` if `vt` was 0, otherwise `kq2` is the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`. `i` is `i + 1`, `len(a)` is the length of the input string `a`, `q` is `q + 1` and is now less than `t`, `b` is the newly input string, `a` is the input string from the user, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))**.
