Postcondition: `i` is 1, `len(a)` is the length of the input string `a`, `kq1` is a string that includes either the string representation of `x` or `y` depending on the comparison result, `kq2` is a string that includes either the string representation of `y` or `x` depending on the comparison result, `vt` is 1, `q` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `t`, `b` is the newly input string, `a` is the input string from the user, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`.
