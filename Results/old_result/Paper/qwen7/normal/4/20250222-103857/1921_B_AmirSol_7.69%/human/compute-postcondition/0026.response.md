Output State: **`counter` is either 0 or 1, `i` is either 2 or 3, `n` must be greater than `i`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was initially 1, it becomes 2, and if `i` was initially 2, it becomes 3. The other variables (`counter` and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `counter` is either 0 or 1, `i` is either 2 or 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.
