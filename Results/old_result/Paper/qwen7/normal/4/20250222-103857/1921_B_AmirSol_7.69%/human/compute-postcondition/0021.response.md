Output State: **`counter` is either 3 or 4; `i` is either 3 or 4; `n` must be greater than `i`.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 2. Since `i` was either 1 or 2, adding 2 to it results in `i` being either 3 or 4. The value of `counter` is increased by 1, making it either 3 or 4 (depending on its original value). The condition that `n` must be greater than `i` remains unchanged.
