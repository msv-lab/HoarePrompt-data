Postcondition: `counter` is either 0 or 1, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` is greater than 0 and within the range 1 to 10^5 inclusive. If `counter` is 1, it means that `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` under certain conditions: if `i` is less than `n - 1`, then `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`. If `i` is not less than `n - 1`, then either `i` is equal to `n-1`, or `s1[i+1]` is equal to `s2[i+1]`, or `s1[i]` is equal to `s1[i+1]`. If `counter` is 0, it means that `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]` and `i` is 1.
