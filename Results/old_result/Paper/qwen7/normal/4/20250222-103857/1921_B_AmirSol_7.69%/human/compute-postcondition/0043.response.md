Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: an integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)), and two strings \( s1 \) and \( s2 \) of length \( n \) consisting of '0' and '1'. It returns the total number of positions where \( s1[i] \) is not equal to \( s2[i] \) and satisfies the conditions inside the if block. After the function execution, the variable \( i \) is set to \( n \), and the original values of \( n \), \( s1 \), and \( s2 \) remain unchanged.**
