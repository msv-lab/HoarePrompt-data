Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is:
  - `i` is `n-3`
  - `suff[i]` is `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`

- The for loop statement is:
  ```python
  for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `n-1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.
3. **State Adjustment**: We need to determine the new value of `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-3`.
2. **Next Iteration**: For the next iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `(n-3) - 1 = n-4`.

### New State:
- The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`.
- The new value of `i` is `n-4`.

### Final State:
- `i` is now `n-4`.
- `suff[i]` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the loop head.

### Answer:
State: **`i` is `n-4`, `suff[i]` is `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`**
