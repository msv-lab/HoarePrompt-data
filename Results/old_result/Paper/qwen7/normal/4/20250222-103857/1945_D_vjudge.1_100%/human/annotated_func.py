#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, a, b):
    c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]
    suff = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `-1`, and `suff[i]` will be the sum of all elements in the list `c`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates from `n-1` down to `0`. Each iteration updates `suff[i]` based on the value of `suff[i+1]` and the current element `c[i]` in the list `c`. Since the loop starts at `n-1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`, after all iterations, `i` will be `-1`. At this point, `suff[-1]` will hold the cumulative sum of all elements in `c`, as each `suff[i]` is built up from `suff[i+1]` plus `c[i]` in reverse order.
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k):
        ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i + 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is the minimum value among all `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for `i` in the range `[0, k-1]`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will hold the smallest value obtained from adding `a[i]` and `suff[i + 1]` for every possible `i` in the range from `0` to `k-1`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum value among all a[i] + suff[i + 1] for i in the range [0, k-1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for `i` in the range `[0, k-1]`, where `suff` is a list representing the cumulative sum of the minimum values of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`. The function returns the computed minimum value.
