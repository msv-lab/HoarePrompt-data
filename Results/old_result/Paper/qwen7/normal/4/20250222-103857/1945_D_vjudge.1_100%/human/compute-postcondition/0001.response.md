Output State: **`c` is a list of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for `i` in the range of `n`; `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` retain their original values; `suff` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is `0`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `suff` with `n+1` elements, all set to `0`. This does not affect the values of `c`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their original values, and `c` remains unchanged as well.
