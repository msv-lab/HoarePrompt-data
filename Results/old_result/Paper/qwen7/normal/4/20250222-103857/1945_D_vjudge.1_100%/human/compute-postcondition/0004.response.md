Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop starts from `n-1` and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` is no longer greater than or equal to 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is `n-2`
   - `suff[i]` is `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, the next value of `i` will be `n-3`.

5. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0. Given that `i` is currently `n-2`, the next value `i = n-3` will still satisfy this condition as long as `n > 3`.

6. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: 
   - `i` will be `n-3`.
   - The value of `suff[i]` will depend on the values of `suff[i+1]` and `c[i]`, but since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine the exact value of `suff[i]` without knowing the loop body. However, we know that the relationship `suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]` will hold true for the next value of `i`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is `n-3`, `suff[i]` is `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`**
