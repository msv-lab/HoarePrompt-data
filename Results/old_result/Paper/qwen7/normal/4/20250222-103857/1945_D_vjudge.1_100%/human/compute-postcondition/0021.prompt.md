You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, a, b):
    c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]
    suff = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `-1`, and `suff[i]` will be the sum of all elements in the list `c`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates from `n-1` down to `0`. Each iteration updates `suff[i]` based on the value of `suff[i+1]` and the current element `c[i]` in the list `c`. Since the loop starts at `n-1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`, after all iterations, `i` will be `-1`. At this point, `suff[-1]` will hold the cumulative sum of all elements in `c`, as each `suff[i]` is built up from `suff[i+1]` plus `c[i]` in reverse order.
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k):
        ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i + 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is the minimum value among all `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for `i` in the range `[0, k-1]`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will hold the smallest value obtained from adding `a[i]` and `suff[i + 1]` for every possible `i` in the range from `0` to `k-1`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum value among all a[i] + suff[i + 1] for i in the range [0, k-1])
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It returns a value based on the lists `a` and `b` and the integer `k`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
