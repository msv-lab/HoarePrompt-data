Output State: `ans` is the minimum value among all `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for `i` in the range `[0, k-1]`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will hold the smallest value obtained from adding `a[i]` and `suff[i + 1]` for every possible `i` in the range from `0` to `k-1`.
