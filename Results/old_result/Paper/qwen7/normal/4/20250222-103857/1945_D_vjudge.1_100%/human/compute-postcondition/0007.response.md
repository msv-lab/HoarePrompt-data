Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `suff[i]` is `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`**

Explanation: The code `suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]` updates the value of `suff[i]` to be equal to `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`. This means that the value of `suff[i]` is now updated, but the value of `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `i` is still `n-4` and `suff[i]` is now `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`.
