Output State: **`t` is 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers updated from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still 0. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the integers provided by the input.
