Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, but their specific values are not provided. They are updated from an input split by spaces.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(n * a)
```

Since `n` and `a` are updated from an input split by spaces, let's denote the values they take as `n_val` and `a_val` respectively. Therefore, the expression `n * a` becomes `n_val * a_val`.

Given this, the output will be:
Output: **n_val * a_val**
