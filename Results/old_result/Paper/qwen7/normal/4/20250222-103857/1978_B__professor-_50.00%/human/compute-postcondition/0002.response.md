Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**

The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The initial condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
