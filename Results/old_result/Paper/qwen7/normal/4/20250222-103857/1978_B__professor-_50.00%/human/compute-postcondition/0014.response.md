Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, no changes are made to `t`. Otherwise, if `b` is greater than `a`, no changes are made to `t` as long as the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.
