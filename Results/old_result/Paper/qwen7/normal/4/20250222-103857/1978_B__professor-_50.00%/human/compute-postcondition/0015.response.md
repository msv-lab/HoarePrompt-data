Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.

4. **Determine the adjustments needed for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.
   - Since the loop does not modify `t` directly within its body (it only checks the condition), `t` will be decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `t` must be greater than 0 and it will be decremented by 1, `t` must be 1 at the start of the next iteration to ensure it remains greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
