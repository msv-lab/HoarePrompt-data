Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for calculating the maximum profit Bob can obtain.

1. **Case 1: \( b \leq a \)**
   - If the modified price \( b \) is less than or equal to the usual price \( a \), Bob should sell all buns at the usual price \( a \). This is because selling even the first bun at the modified price would result in a lower total profit.
   - The program correctly handles this case by printing \( n \times a \).

2. **Case 2: \( b - a \geq n \)**
   - If the difference between the modified price \( b \) and the usual price \( a \) is greater than or equal to the number of buns \( n \), Bob should sell the first \( n \) buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price.
   - The program correctly calculates the sum of an arithmetic series for the first \( n \) buns using the formula \( \frac{n(2b - n + 1)}{2} \) and adds the remaining buns sold at the usual price \( a \).

3. **Case 3: \( b - a < n \)**
   - If the difference between the modified price \( b \) and the usual price \( a \) is less than the number of buns \( n \), Bob should sell the first \( b - a + 1 \) buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price.
   - The program correctly calculates the sum of the first \( b - a + 1 \) terms of an arithmetic series starting from \( b \) with a common difference of -1, which is \( \frac{(b - a + 1)(b - a + 2)}{2} \), and adds the remaining buns sold at the usual price \( a \).

Given that the program correctly handles all three cases as described in the problem statement, the provided solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
