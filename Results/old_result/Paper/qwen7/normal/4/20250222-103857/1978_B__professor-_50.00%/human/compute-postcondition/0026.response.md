Given the initial state where `t` is 0, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers updated from the input split by spaces, let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement:

1. The expression is `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`.
2. Since `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated from the input, they are unknown specific values at this point.
3. We need to evaluate the expression with these unknowns.

Let's denote the values of `n` and `b` as `n_val` and `b_val` respectively, since their exact values are not specified in the initial state.

The expression becomes:
\[ \text{int}((2 * b_val - n_val + 1) * n_val / 2) \]

This expression calculates a specific mathematical result based on the values of `n_val` and `b_val`.

Output: **int((2 * b_val - n_val + 1) * n_val / 2)** (where `n_val` and `b_val` are the values of `n` and `b` respectively, obtained from the input split by spaces)
