Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and splits them into three variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
