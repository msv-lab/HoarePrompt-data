Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split; `itest` is `t`.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `itest` is still equal to `t`.
