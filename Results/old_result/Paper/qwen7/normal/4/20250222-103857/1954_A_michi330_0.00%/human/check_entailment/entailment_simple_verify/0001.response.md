### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to ensure the logic is correct.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Conditions for "NO":**
   - The program checks two conditions to determine if the answer should be "NO":
     - If `n <= k`: This means Bob can repaint all parts, so Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.
     - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`: This condition checks if the number of parts with unique colors (at least `math.ceil(n / m)` parts will have different colors) is less than `k`. If this is true, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

3. **Conditions for "Yes":**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "Yes". This implies that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

#### Testing the Conditions:

1. **Case 1: \( n \leq k \)**
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer should be "NO".
   - Example: \( n = 5 \), \( k = 6 \). Here, `n <= k` is true, so the answer should be "NO".

2. **Case 2: \( n - \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil < k \)**
   - If the number of parts with unique colors (`math.ceil(n / m)`) is more than `k`, Bob cannot repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.
   - Example: \( n = 5 \), \( m = 2 \), \( k = 1 \). Here, `math.ceil(n / m) = 3` and `n - 3 = 2`, which is less than `k = 1`. So the answer should be "YES".

3. **Case 3: Neither Condition is Met**
   - If neither condition is met, the answer should be "YES".
   - Example: \( n = 5 \), \( m = 2 \), \( k = 2 \). Here, `n = 5` and `math.ceil(n / m) = 3`, so `n - 3 = 2` which is equal to `k`. Since neither condition is met, the answer should be "YES".

#### Correctness of the Program:

- The logic in the program correctly handles the conditions to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
- The program uses the correct mathematical conditions to check if Bob can achieve his goal.

#### Final Evaluation:

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The conditions are checked accurately, and the output matches the expected results for all provided examples.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
