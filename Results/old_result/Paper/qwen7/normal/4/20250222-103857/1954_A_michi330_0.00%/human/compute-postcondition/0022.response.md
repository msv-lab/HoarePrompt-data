Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes three integers t, n, and m (with constraints 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50). For each test case, it processes the values and returns different outputs based on the conditions specified.**

Given the constraints and the implied nature of the function, it appears the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing integers t, n, and m. However, since the function definition itself does not explicitly list any parameters, the function's role is inferred from the problem description. The function processes these test cases and returns outputs based on specific conditions related to the values of n, m, and k within each test case.
