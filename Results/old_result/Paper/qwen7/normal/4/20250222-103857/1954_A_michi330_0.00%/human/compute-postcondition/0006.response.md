Output: **Yes**

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from the input split.
- It is also given that `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than or equal to `k`.

The `print('Yes')` statement simply prints the string `'Yes'`. Since no other variables or objects are being printed, and the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` do not affect the output of this specific print statement, the only thing printed is the string `'Yes'`.
