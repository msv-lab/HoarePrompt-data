Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split.
   - `itest` is `t`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `itest` in the range from 0 to `t-1`.

3. **Postcondition:**
   - If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, then no changes are made to `t`.
   - Otherwise, no changes are made to `t`.

4. **Key Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `itest`: This variable is used as the loop counter.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - At the start of each iteration, `itest` is incremented by 1.
   - The loop continues as long as `itest` is less than `t`.

6. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
   - `itest` is `t - 1` (since it starts from 0 and increments until it reaches `t - 1`).

7. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `itest` will be `t` (since it increments by 1 in each iteration).
   - `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are only related to `itest`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split; `itest` is `t`**.
