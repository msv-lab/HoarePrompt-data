Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `m` (number of colors) is greater than `k` (number of parts Bob can repaint). According to the problem description, if `m > k`, Alice can always paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
5
5 3 2
```
Here, `n = 5`, `m = 3`, and `k = 2`. Since `m > k`, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. The program incorrectly outputs 'NO' in this case because it does not handle the condition where `m > k`.

To fix this, the condition `if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:` should be modified to `if n <= k or m > k:`.
