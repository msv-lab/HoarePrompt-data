Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `index` is `data[index + 2]`, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is an list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` equals 0, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of bisect_left(v1, l)**

Explanation: The code `it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)` calculates the index of the first occurrence in `v1` where the value is greater than or equal to `l`. The values of `q`, `index`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new variable `it1` is assigned the result of the `bisect_left` function, which depends on the values of `v1` and `l`.
