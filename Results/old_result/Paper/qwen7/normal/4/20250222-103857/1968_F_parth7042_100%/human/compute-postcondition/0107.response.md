Output State: `i` is `n + 1`; `index` is `x + n`; `pf[n + 1]` is `pf[n] ^ a[n + 1]`; `mp[pf[n + 1]]` includes the value `n + 1`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`. The `index` will be `x + n` since it starts at 29 and increments by 1 for each iteration. The final value of `pf` will be `pf[n] ^ a[n + 1]` as the loop updates `pf[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n + 1`. Finally, `mp[pf[n + 1]]` will include the value `n + 1` because the loop appends the index `i` to `mp[pf[i]]` for each iteration.
