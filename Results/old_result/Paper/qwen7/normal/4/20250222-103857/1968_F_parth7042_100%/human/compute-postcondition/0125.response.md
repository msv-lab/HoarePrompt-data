Postcondition: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. The condition `(it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] < v2[it2]))` is false.**
