You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, each test case consists of n and q where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, and each query is a pair of integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        q = int(data[index + 1])
        
        index += 2
        
        a = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        pf = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        mp = defaultdict(list)
        
        mp[0].append(0)
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            a[i] = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[index])
            r = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp[pf[r]]
            v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
            it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
        
    #State: `index` is 49, `q` is the original `q` minus 3, `results` is a list of 'YES' and 'NO' based on all the queries processed, and `a`, `pf`, and `mp` are reset to their initial states as defined in the initial state.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: YES\nNO\n... (where the list consists of 'YES' and 'NO' based on all the queries processed)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a predefined set of inputs including a positive integer `t`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. For each query defined by integers `l` and `r`, it returns a result based on the subarray of `a` from index `l` to `r-1`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
