Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
2. It initializes necessary variables and data structures such as `t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf` (prefix XOR array), and `mp` (dictionary to store indices of prefix XOR values).
3. The prefix XOR array `pf` is constructed, where `pf[i]` stores the XOR of the subarray `a[1]` to `a[i]`.
4. For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray from index `l` to `r-1` using the prefix XOR array.
5. If the XOR value is zero, it appends 'YES' to the results, indicating the subarray is interesting.
6. Otherwise, it checks if there exists a valid split point within the subarray using binary search (`bisect_left`) and appends 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
7. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given the execution summary and the detailed analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
