Output State: **`index` is 25, `q` is 1, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `l` is an integer value from `data[22]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[23]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` if such an occurrence exists, otherwise it is the insertion point where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order in `v1`, `it2` is reassigned to `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], r) - 1`, and `results` is `['YES', 'NO', 'NO']` if `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`; otherwise, `results` is `['NO', 'NO', 'NO']`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i` starting at 1 up to `n + 1`. Since the loop has executed 3 times, and `i` is currently 11, it implies that `n` is 10 (because `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `n + 1`).
- After 3 iterations, `index` is 21. The loop will continue to run until `i` reaches `n + 1`, which means it will run one more time, making it 4 total iterations.
- After 4 iterations, `index` will be 25 (`index` increases by 2 with each iteration, so \(21 + 2 \times (4 - 3) = 25\)).
- `q` decreases by 1 with each iteration, so after 4 iterations, `q` will be 1.
- The values of `x`, `l`, `r`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` will be determined by the current values of `pf[r]`, `pf[l - 1]`, `mp[pf[r]]`, `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, and the binary search operations.
- The `results` list will contain the outcomes of the conditions checked in the loop. Since the loop has run 4 times, the `results` list will have 3 elements from the previous iterations and one more check, resulting in 4 elements in total. Given the pattern, if the condition `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]` holds true, `results` will have `['YES', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES']` or similar, but based on the last state provided, it will likely end with `['NO']` again, leading to `['NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO']`.
