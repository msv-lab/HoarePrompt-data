Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 8, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `v2` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `results` is 'YES' because the append operation adds 'YES' to the list.**

Explanation: The code appends 'YES' to the `results` list. Since `results` was initially 'NO', appending 'YES' changes its value to 'YES'. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous values.
