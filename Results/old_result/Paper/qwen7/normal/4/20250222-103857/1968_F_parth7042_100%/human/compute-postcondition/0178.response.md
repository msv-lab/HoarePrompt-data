Output State: **`a[i]` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, `index` is 5 more than its previous value, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `pf[i]` is calculated as `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]`, `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value `i - 1`, and `mp[pf[i]]` now also contains the value `i`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current index `i` to the list `mp[pf[i]]`. Given the initial conditions, `mp[pf[i]]` was already a list containing `i - 1`. After executing the line `mp[pf[i]].append(i)`, the list `mp[pf[i]]` now includes both `i - 1` and `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
