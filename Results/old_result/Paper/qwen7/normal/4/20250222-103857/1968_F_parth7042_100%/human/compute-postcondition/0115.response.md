Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` contains 'YES'**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain the same as the initial state. The value of `x` is already given as 0, which does not change.
