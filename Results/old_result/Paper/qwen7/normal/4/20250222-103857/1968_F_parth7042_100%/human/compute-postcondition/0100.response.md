Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` must be greater than or equal to 3; `index` is increased by 1; `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `pf[3]` to be the bitwise XOR of `pf[2]` and `a[3]`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `index`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
