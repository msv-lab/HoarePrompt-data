Output State: **`index` is 17, `q` is 3, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `l` is an integer value from `data[15]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[17]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` if such an occurrence exists, otherwise it is the insertion point where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order in `v1`, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `results` list now contains 'YES' appended.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('YES')` appends the string 'YES' to the `results` list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
