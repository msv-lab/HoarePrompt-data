Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 3, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `results` is ['YES'], and `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('YES')` adds the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. Since `results` was previously defined as a list (though its exact content before this operation was not specified), appending `'YES'` to it changes its content to `['YES']`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
