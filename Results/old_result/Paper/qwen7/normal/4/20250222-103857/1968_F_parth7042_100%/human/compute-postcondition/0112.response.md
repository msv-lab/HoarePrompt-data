Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]**.

Explanation: The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. The other variables (`data`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged. Since `l` was previously the integer value of `data[index]` and `r` was the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, after incrementing `index` by 2, `l` now corresponds to `data[index - 2]` and `r` to `data[index - 1]`.
