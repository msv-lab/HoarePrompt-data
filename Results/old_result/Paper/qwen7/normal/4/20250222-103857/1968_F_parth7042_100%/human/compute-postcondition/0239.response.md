Based on the initial state provided:

- `index` is 49.
- `q` is the original `q` minus 3.
- `results` is a list of 'YES' and 'NO' based on all the queries processed.
- `a`, `pf`, and `mp` are reset to their initial states as defined in the initial state.

The `print('\n'.join(results))` statement will join all the elements in the `results` list with a newline character (`\n`) and then print them out.

Since the exact content of the `results` list is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe it in terms of its composition.

Output: **YES\nNO\n... (where the list consists of 'YES' and 'NO' based on all the queries processed)**
