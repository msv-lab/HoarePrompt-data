The code `results.append('YES')` appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. Since `results` was not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. After appending `'YES'`, `results` will contain `'YES'`.

The other variables (`q`, `index`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `l`, `r`, and `x`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `index` is `data[index + 2]`, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is an empty list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]` and equals 0, `results` is a list containing `'YES'`.**
