Output State: **`a[i]' is assigned the value of `int(data[index])', index is incremented by 1, n' remains greater than or equal to 1, pf[i]' is calculated as `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]', mp[pf[i]] is a list containing the value `i`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current index `i` to the list `mp[pf[i]]`. The values of `a[i]`, `index`, `n`, `pf[i]`, and `data[index]` remain unchanged except that `index` is incremented by 1. The dictionary `mp` now contains a key `pf[i]` which maps to a list that includes the current index `i`.
