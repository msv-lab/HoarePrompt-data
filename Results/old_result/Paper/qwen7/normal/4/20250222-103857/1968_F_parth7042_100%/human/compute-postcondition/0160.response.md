Output State: **The loop has executed all iterations, resulting in `data` remaining unchanged, `index` being `x + n + 1`, `results` containing a list of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the conditions checked within the loop, and the variables `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` being updated according to the loop's logic for each iteration.**

Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the `index` will be `x + n + 1` because it starts at `29` and increases by `2` with each iteration, so after `n` iterations, it will be `29 + 2 * n`. The `data` list remains unchanged throughout the loop. The `results` list will contain either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop. Variables like `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` will be updated according to the logic inside the loop for each iteration.
