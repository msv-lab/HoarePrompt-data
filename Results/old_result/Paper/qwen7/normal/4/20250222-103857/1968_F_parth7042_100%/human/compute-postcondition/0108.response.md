Output State: `i` is `n + 1`; `index` is `x + n`; `pf[n + 1]` is `pf[n] ^ a[n + 1]`; `mp[pf[n + 1]]` includes the value `n + 1`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`. The `index` will be `x + n` because it starts at `29` and increases by `1` each iteration, so after `n` iterations, it will be `29 + n`. The `pf` array will have been updated such that `pf[n + 1]` is the XOR of `pf[n]` and `a[n + 1]`. The `mp` dictionary will include the value `n + 1` in the list corresponding to `pf[n + 1]`.
