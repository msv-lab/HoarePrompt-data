Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 8, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `v2` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, and `results` is 'NO' because the value of `v1` does not change and `it1` remains the same.**

Explanation: The line `it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1` calculates the position of `r` in the list `v2` using binary search and subtracts 1 from the result. This operation does not affect any previously defined variables such as `data`, `index`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, or `results`. The value of `it2` is updated based on the current value of `v2`, which is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`. Since no new information about `v1` or `it1` is introduced, these remain unchanged. The final state includes the updated value of `it2` and retains the original values of all other variables.
