Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is now `x + n + 4`, `results` contains a list of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the conditions checked within the loop, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` are updated according to the loop's logic for each iteration, and `t` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Initially, `index` was `x + n + 2`. After executing the line of code, `index` becomes `x + n + 4`. All other variables (`data`, `results`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
