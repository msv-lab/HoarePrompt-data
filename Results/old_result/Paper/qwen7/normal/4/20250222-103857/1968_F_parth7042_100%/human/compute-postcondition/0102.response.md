Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3
   - `index` is increased by 1
   - `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`
   - `mp[pf[3]]` includes the value 3

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n + 1):`
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is currently 3
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 4.
   - `n` must remain greater than or equal to 3 (since it hasn't changed yet).
   - `index` is increased by 1, so if it was previously `index + 1`, it is now `index + 2`.
   - `pf[3]` remains unchanged as it is based on the previous values.
   - `mp[pf[3]]` includes the value 3, which also remains unchanged.

5. **New State:**
   - `i` must be 4
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3
   - `index` must be increased by 1 (let's assume the original `index` was `x`, so now it is `x + 1`)
   - `pf[3]` remains the same (`pf[2] ^ a[3]`)
   - `mp[pf[3]]` still includes the value 3

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `index` is increased by 1, `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`, `mp[pf[3]]` includes the value 3**
