The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the variables outside of any loop remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`index` is 14, `q` is 4, `x` is 0, `mp[pf[12]]` contains `12`, `l` is an integer value from `data[12]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[13]`, `results` contains 'YES'**
