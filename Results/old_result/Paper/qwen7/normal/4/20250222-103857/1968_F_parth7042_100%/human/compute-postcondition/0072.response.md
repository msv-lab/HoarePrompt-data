The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the execution simply moves to the next line without changing any variable values. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`index` is 21, `q` is 2, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `l` is an integer value from `data[18]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[19]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` if such an occurrence exists, otherwise it is the insertion point where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order in `v1`, `it2` is reassigned to `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `results` is `['NO', 'YES']`.**
