Output State: **`index` is 17, `q` is 3, `x` is 0, `l` is an integer value from `data[15]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[17]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` if such an occurrence exists, otherwise it is the insertion point where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order in `v1`, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and `results` list contains 'YES' if `it1` is less than `len(v1)`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`; otherwise, `results` list contains 'NO'**.

Explanation: The line `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Initially, `index` was 15, so after executing this line, `index` becomes 17. The values of `q`, `x`, `l`, `r`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, and the `results` list remain unchanged because no operations were performed on them within the given code snippet.
