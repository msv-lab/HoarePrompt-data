Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `index` is 2; `t` is an integer extracted from `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    q = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    a = [0] * (n + 1)
    pf = [0] * (n + 1)
    mp = defaultdict(list)
    mp[0].append(0)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        a[i] = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
        mp[pf[i]].append(i)
    for _ in range(q):
        l = int(data[index])
        r = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
        if x == 0:
            results.append('YES')
            continue
        v1 = mp[pf[r]]
        v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
        it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
        it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
        if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `index` is 25, `q` is 1, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `l` is an integer value from `data[22]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[23]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` if such an occurrence exists, otherwise it is the insertion point where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order in `v1`, `it2` is reassigned to `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], r) - 1`, and `results` is `['YES', 'NO', 'NO']` if `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`; otherwise, `results` is `['NO', 'NO', 'NO']`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has executed all iterations, resulting in `data` remaining unchanged, `index` being `x + n + 1`, `results` containing a list of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the conditions checked within the loop, and the variables `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` being updated according to the loop's logic for each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop has executed all its iterations, resulting in a final state where `q` is the original value minus the number of iterations (`q` - 3), `index` is `data[index + 6]` (since `index` increments by 2 with each iteration and there were 3 iterations), `a` is an empty list, `pf` is a list containing the cumulative XOR values for the elements processed, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique cumulative XOR value to a list of indices where that value occurs, and `results` contains the outcomes ('YES' or 'NO') of all the queries processed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
