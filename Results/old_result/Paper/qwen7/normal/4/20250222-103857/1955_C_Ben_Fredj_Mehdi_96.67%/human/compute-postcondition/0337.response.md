Output State: **`i` is 2; `k` is the second element of `a` and must be a positive integer such that `1 < k // 2`; `a[g]` is decreased by 1; `a[d]` is decreased by 1 and `d` is decreased by 1; if `a[g]` equals 0, then `g` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `d -= 1` decreases the value of `d` by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
