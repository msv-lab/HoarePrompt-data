Output State: **`a[g]` is 0, `a[d]` is -3, `g` is incremented by 2 compared to its initial value, `d` is decremented by 2 compared to its initial value, and the loop has completed all iterations.**

Explanation: Given the loop continues until `i` reaches `k // 2`, and we know from the output state after 3 iterations that the loop runs 3 times. Since `k` remains constant and `i` increments by 1 each time through the loop, the loop will run exactly 3 times. After 3 iterations, `a[g]` becomes 0, `a[d]` becomes -3, `g` is incremented by 2, and `d` is decremented by 2. The loop completes all its iterations as no exceptions were mentioned to break it prematurely.
