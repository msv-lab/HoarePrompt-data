Output State: **`a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 4` and equals 0; `a[d]` is `int(a[d]) - 3`; `i` is `i + 1`; `k` remains the same; `g` is increased by 1; `d` is decreased by 1 if `a[d]` equals 0; `d` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `d -= 1` decreases the value of `d` by 1. Since `a[d]` was previously `int(a[d]) - 3` and the condition for decreasing `d` by 1 was that `a[d]` equals 0, which is true here, `d` is decreased by 1 again. All other variables remain unchanged.
