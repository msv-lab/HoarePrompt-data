Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer (though its value is not relevant to the print statement).
- `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer, and it is explicitly stated that `n` is equal to 2.
- `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer, and it is explicitly stated that `k` is equal to 2147483648.
- `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces (though the exact list is not needed for this specific print statement).

The print statement is simply `print('2')`.

Output: **2**
