Postcondition: `a[d]` is `int(a[d]) - 1`, `a[g]` is `0`, and `g` is incremented by 1 if `a[g]` was initially `int(a[g]) - 1` and equals 0. If `a[d]` is `0`, then `a[d]` is `int(a[d]) - 2`, `a[g]` is `0`, `g` is incremented by 1, and `d` is decremented by 1. If `a[d]` is not `0`, then no changes occur to `a[d]`, `a[g]` remains `0`, and `g` is incremented by 1.
