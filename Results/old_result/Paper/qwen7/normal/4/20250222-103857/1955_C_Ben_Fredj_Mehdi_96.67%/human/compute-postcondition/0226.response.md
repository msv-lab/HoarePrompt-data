Output State: **`a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 2`, `a[d]` is either `int(a[d]) - 1` or `int(a[d]) - 2`, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` remains the same**

Explanation: The code `a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1` decreases the value of `a[g]` by 1. Since `a[g]` was either `int(a[g]) - 1` or `0` (if it was `int(a[g]) - 1` and became 0), after decrementing, it will now be `int(a[g]) - 2`. The other variables `a[d]`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged according to the initial state and the code provided.
