Output State: **`z` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers split from the input string, the first element of `a` is decreased by 1, `k` is the second element of `a` and must be a positive integer such that `1 < k // 2`, `d` is the length of `a` minus 2, `g` is 1, `i` is 1, `a[d]` is decreased by 1, `a[g]` remains 0, `a[d]` is now a value that is 1 less than its original value.**

Explanation: The variable `g` is incremented by 1, so `g` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
