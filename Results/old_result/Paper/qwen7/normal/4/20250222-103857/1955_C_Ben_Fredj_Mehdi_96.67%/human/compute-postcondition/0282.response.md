Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for z in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `z` and `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `z` is incremented by 1.
   - `t` is an input integer.
   - `n` is the first element of the list `a` before the first space.
   - `k` is the integer value of the substring of `a` starting right after the first space.
   - `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - If `k` equals 1999999998, `z` remains incremented by 1.
   - Otherwise, `z` remains incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `z` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, regardless of the condition, `z` will be incremented by 1 again.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is an input integer and does not change within the loop.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `z` will be incremented by 1.
   - `t` remains the same.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`z` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer, `n` is the first element of the list `a` before the first space, `k` is the integer value of the substring of `a` starting right after the first space, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

However, since we only need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head (`z` and `t`), the final answer is:

State: **`z` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer**.
