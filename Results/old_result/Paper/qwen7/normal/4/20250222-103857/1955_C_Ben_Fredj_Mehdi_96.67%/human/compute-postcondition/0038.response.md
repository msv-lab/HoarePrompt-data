Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer (though its value is not relevant to the print statement).
- `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer.
- `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer.
- `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.
- The conditions about `n`, `k`, and the first element of `a` are given, but they do not affect the execution of the print statement.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('10000')
```

This statement will print the string `'10000'`.

Output: **10000**
