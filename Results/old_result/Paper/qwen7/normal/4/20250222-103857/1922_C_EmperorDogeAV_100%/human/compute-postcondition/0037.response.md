Output State: **`i` is either `k + 3` or `k + 2`, `n` remains the same, `back` is `cities[i - 1]`, `forward` is `999999999999999999`, and `prog_cities[i]` is `999999999999999999`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `back` to the value of `cities[i - 1]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `forward`, and `prog_cities[i]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
