Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves finding the minimum cost to travel between two cities on a number line. The cost can either be the direct distance between the cities or the cost to travel to the closest city plus the distance from the closest city to the destination.

2. **Key Components**:
   - The `func_1` function is supposed to compute an array where each element represents the cost to travel to the closest city.
   - The prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) are used to quickly compute the cumulative costs for forward and backward travel.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly identifies the closest city for each city by comparing distances to the previous and next city.
   - However, the logic for setting `prog_cities[i]` is flawed. It should set `prog_cities[i]` to the index of the closest city, not the absolute distance.

4. **Issues with the Provided Code**:
   - The `func_1` function sets `prog_cities[i]` to the absolute distance to the closest city, but it should set it to the index of the closest city.
   - The `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` calculations are based on these incorrect values, leading to incorrect results.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Identify the closest city for each city.
   - Use the indices of these closest cities to compute the prefix sums.
   - Use the prefix sums to answer the queries efficiently.

Given the issues identified, the provided code is incorrect because it misidentifies the closest city and uses incorrect values for the prefix sums.

Correctness: **False**
