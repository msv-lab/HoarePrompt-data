Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables involved in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the value `n - 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `cities` is a list of \( n \) integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order.
   - `prog_cities` is a list of \( n - 1 \) zeros.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2` (inclusive), meaning `i` should be less than `n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time through the loop. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be 0.
   - The value `n - 1` determines the upper limit of the loop. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be a positive integer.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 0.
- `n - 1` must be a positive integer.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n - 1` must be a positive integer**.
