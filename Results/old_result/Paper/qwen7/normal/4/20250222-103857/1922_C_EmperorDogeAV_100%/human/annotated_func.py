#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, and n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        
        forward = 999999999999999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, `back` will be `cities[n - 2]`, and `forward` will be `cities[n - 1]` if `n > 1`. For each index `i` from `0` to `n - 2`, `prog_cities[i]` will be set to `1` if the distance to the next city (`forward`) is less than the distance to the previous city (`back`). Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` will be set to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` if `i < n - 1`, or it will remain `0` if `i` is the last index (`n - 1`).
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns a list `prog_cities` where each element is determined based on the conditions described. Specifically, for each index `i` from `0` to `n-2`:
    #
    #- If the distance to the next city (`forward`) is less than the distance to the previous city (`back`), then `prog_cities[i]` is set to `1`.
    #- Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is set to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` if `i < n - 1`, or it remains `0` if `i` is the last index (`n - 1`).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of city coordinates `cities` and an integer `n` indicating the number of cities. It returns a list `prog_cities` where each element is set to `1` if the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city; otherwise, it is set to the absolute difference between the distances to the next and current city if the index is not the last one, or `0` if it is the last index.
