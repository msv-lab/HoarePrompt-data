Output State: **`i` is either `k + 2` or `k + 1`, `n` remains the same, `back` is updated to `cities[i - 1]`, `forward` is either `cities[i + 1]` (if `i < n - 1`) or remains `999999999999999999` (if `i == n - 1`), and `prog_cities[i]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `prog_cities[i] = 1` updates the value of `prog_cities` at index `i` to 1. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `back`, or `forward`. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `back`, and `forward` remain as they were in the initial state. Additionally, `prog_cities[i]` is now set to 1.
