Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2` (since `range(n - 1)` generates values from 0 to `n-2`).

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value `k`. For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Postconditions**:
   - `back`: If `i` is not greater than 0, `back` remains `-99999999999999999999`. Otherwise, `back` is `cities[i - 1]`.
   - `forward`: This is `cities[i + 1]`.
   - `prog_cities[i]`: This is determined based on the comparison of `forward` and `cities[i]`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- If `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `back` and `forward` depend on the new value of `i` (which is `k + 1`).
- `prog_cities[i]` will be recalculated based on the new values of `back` and `forward`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `n` is the same, `back` is either `-99999999999999999999` if `k + 1` is not greater than 0 or `cities[k]` if `k + 1` is greater than 0, `forward` is `cities[k + 2]`, and `prog_cities[k + 1]` is the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[k + 1]` if `abs(forward - cities[k + 1]) < abs(cities[k + 1] - back)`, otherwise `prog_cities[k + 1]` is 1.**
