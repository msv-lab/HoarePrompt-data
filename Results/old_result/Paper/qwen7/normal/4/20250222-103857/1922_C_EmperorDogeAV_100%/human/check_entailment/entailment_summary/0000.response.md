Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum number of coins required to travel between two cities. The key operations are moving to any other city directly or moving to the closest city with a cost of 1 coin.
2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**: This function calculates the closest city for each city. However, the implementation seems to be incorrect because it only checks the next and previous cities without ensuring the unique closest city condition.
3. **Execution Summary Analysis**: The summary states that `func_1` sets elements to 1 if the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city; otherwise, it sets it to the absolute difference between the distances to the next and current city if the index is not the last one, or 0 if it is the last index. This logic does not correctly identify the closest city.
4. **Correct Approach**: To correctly identify the closest city, we should maintain a list of indices representing the closest city for each city. We need to iterate through the list and ensure that for each city, the closest city is uniquely identified.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the closest city for each city. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
