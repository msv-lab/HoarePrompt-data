Output State: **`i` is either `k + 2` or `k + 1`, `n` remains the same, `back` is updated to `cities[i - 1]`, `forward` is either `cities[i + 1]` (if `i < n - 1`) or remains `999999999999999999` (if `i == n - 1`), and `prog_cities[k + 1]` is 1; `prog_cities[i]` is `abs(forward - cities[i])`**.

In more detail, the value of `prog_cities[i]` is updated to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`. Since `forward` is either `cities[i + 1]` (if `i < n - 1`) or `999999999999999999` (if `i == n - 1`), the value of `prog_cities[i]` is now `abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i])` if `i < n - 1`, or `abs(999999999999999999 - cities[i])` if `i == n - 1`. All other variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
