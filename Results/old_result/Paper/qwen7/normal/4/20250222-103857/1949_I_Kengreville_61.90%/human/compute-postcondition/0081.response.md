Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `ok` will be True if the sum of `coef1[j]` for any `j` in all traversed `nodes` is not zero, otherwise `ok` remains False. The variable `nodes` will be empty since `i` starts from `n-1` and decreases with each iteration until it reaches `-1`. The variables `c0` and `c1` will be the cumulative sums of `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` for all elements `j` in all traversed `nodes` respectively. All other variables such as `visited` and `coef1` will retain their final states from the last iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `n`, `ok` will be True if any path through the nodes results in a non-zero `c1` value, and `nodes` will be empty. The values of `c0` and `c1` will reflect the sums of `coef0` and `coef1` across all traversed nodes.
