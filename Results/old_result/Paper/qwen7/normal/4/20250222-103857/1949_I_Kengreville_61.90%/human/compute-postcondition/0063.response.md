Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `nodes` is an empty list, `c0` is increased by `coef0[j]` for each element `j` in the empty list (which means `c0` remains unchanged), `c1` is increased by `1` for each element `j` in the empty list (which means `c1` remains unchanged), `ok` remains unchanged (since `c1` is 0 and does not change), `coef0[i]` is 0, `coef1[i]` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `nodes = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `nodes`. This affects the values of `c0` and `c1` since they are updated based on elements in `nodes`. Since `nodes` is now an empty list, `c0` and `c1` remain unchanged from their previous values. The value of `ok` also remains unchanged because `c1` is 0 and does not change. All other variables retain their initial states.
