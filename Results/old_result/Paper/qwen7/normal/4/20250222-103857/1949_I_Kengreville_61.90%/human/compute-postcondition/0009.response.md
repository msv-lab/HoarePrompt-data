Output State: **`j` is 0; `dx` is `x[i] - x[0]`; `dy` is `y[i] - y[0]`; `visited[j]` is True; `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`; `coef1[j] is `-coef1[i]`.**

Explanation: The `dfs(j)` function call is made, which typically stands for Depth-First Search. In this context, it marks the node `j` as visited, which changes the state of `visited[j]` from `False` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
