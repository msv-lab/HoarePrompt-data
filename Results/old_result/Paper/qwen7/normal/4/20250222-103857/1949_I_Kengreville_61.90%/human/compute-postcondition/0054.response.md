Output State: **`nodes` is a list containing at least two elements, `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` where `j` is the next element in `nodes`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `c1` by adding `coef1[j]`, where `j` is the next element in the list `nodes`. The initial state of `nodes` being a list containing at least two elements and `c0` being increased by `coef0[j]` remains unchanged. The only change is that `c1` is now increased by `coef1[j]` where `j` is the next element in `nodes`.
