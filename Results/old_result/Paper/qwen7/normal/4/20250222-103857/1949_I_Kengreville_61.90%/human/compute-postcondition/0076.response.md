Output State: The `nodes` list remains empty, `c0` is incremented by the sum of `coef0[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`, and `c1` is incremented by the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `nodes` list will still be empty since no elements were added to it during the loop's execution. The value of `c0` will be the sum of `coef0[j]` for all `j` present in `nodes`, which is zero because `nodes` is empty. Similarly, `c1` will be the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` present in `nodes`, which is also zero because `nodes` is empty. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `ok`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
