### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if we can adjust the radii of the disks such that:
     - Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent.
     - No two disks overlap.
     - The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code defines two functions: `func_1` and `dfs`.
   - `func_1` initializes variables and reads input.
   - `dfs` performs a depth-first search (DFS) to explore connected components of tangent disks.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The DFS function checks for tangency between disks using the condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`.
   - It updates coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) to ensure the tangency condition is maintained.
   - The main logic in `func_1` iterates through each disk, performs DFS, and checks if any valid adjustments can be made.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The DFS function correctly identifies pairs of tangent disks.
   - The coefficients are updated to maintain tangency while potentially decreasing the sum of radii.
   - The main loop in `func_1` ensures that all connected components are checked.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where disks are tangent and checks if the sum of radii can be decreased.
   - It correctly prints "YES" if a valid adjustment is found and "NO" otherwise.

However, upon closer inspection, there are some issues with the logic and the implementation:

- **Coefficient Update Logic:** The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to maintain tangency, but the update logic does not ensure that the sum of radii strictly decreases. Specifically, the update rule `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]` does not guarantee a strict decrease in the sum of radii.
- **No Strict Decrease Check:** The code does not explicitly check if the sum of radii strictly decreases. Instead, it only checks if `c1` (sum of `coef1[j]` values) is non-zero, which is not sufficient to ensure a strict decrease.
- **DFS Traversal:** While the DFS correctly identifies connected components of tangent disks, it does not ensure that the radii can be adjusted to meet the problem requirements.

Given these observations, the code does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that the sum of radii strictly decreases. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to check if the radii of the disks can be adjusted as required. It fails to ensure that the sum of radii strictly decreases.

### Correctness:

**False**

Final: **False**
