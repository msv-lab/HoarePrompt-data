Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `nodes` is an empty list, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 0, `ok` remains unchanged, `coef0[i]` is 0, `coef1[i]` is 1.**

The code simply reassigns the value of `c0` to 0, which does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `nodes`, `c1`, `ok`, `coef0[i]`, and `coef1[i]` remain unchanged.
