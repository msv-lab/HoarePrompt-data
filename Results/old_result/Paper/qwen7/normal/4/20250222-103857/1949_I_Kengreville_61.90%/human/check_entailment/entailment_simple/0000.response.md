Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of disks `n` and the coordinates and radii of each disk. This part is handled correctly.

2. **DFS Initialization**: The program initializes the `visited` list to keep track of which disks have been processed. It also initializes `coef0` and `coef1` lists to store coefficients used in the linear system derived from the tangency conditions.

3. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function is designed to traverse the graph formed by the tangency relationships between disks. It marks disks as visited and updates the `coef0` and `coef1` values based on the tangency conditions. This ensures that the relationships between the disks are correctly captured.

4. **Main Logic**: The main logic iterates over each disk, performing a DFS if the disk hasn't been visited yet. It checks if the sum of `coef1` values across all nodes visited during the DFS is non-zero. If this sum is non-zero, it indicates that it's possible to adjust the radii such that the tangency conditions are maintained and the total radius sum decreases.

5. **Output Determination**: Based on the result of the main logic, the program prints "YES" if it's possible to adjust the radii as required, and "NO" otherwise.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to adjust the radii of the disks while maintaining tangency and decreasing the total radius sum.

Correctness: **True**
