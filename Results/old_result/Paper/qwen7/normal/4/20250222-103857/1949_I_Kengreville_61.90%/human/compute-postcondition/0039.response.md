Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `nodes` is a non-empty list
   - `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`
   - `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`
   - `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, and the loop condition is `i < n`, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop head.
   - The values of `nodes`, `c0`, `c1`, and `ok` are not part of the loop head, so they remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `nodes` is a non-empty list, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`, and `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged**.
