Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` must be a positive integer, `nodes` will be a list that may contain elements based on the DFS calls but will be empty if no nodes are visited, `c0` will be the sum of all `coef0[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`, `c1` will be the sum of all `coef1[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`, and `ok` will be True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` will remain unchanged.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will have incremented to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The `nodes` list will reflect any nodes that were visited during the DFS calls within the loop, but it will be empty if no nodes were visited. The values of `c0` and `c1` will be updated based on the sum of `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` for all visited nodes, respectively. The `ok` variable will be True if there was at least one node with `coef1[j]` not equal to 0, otherwise, it will remain unchanged from its initial value.
