Output State: The `frequency_table` will contain the count of each number in the `arr` list, but capped at `k`. Specifically, for any number `num` in `arr`, if its count exceeds `k`, it will be set to exactly `k`. If the count does not exceed `k`, it will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `num` in `arr`.

This means that after the loop has executed all iterations, every entry in the `frequency_table` will represent the minimum of the actual count of each number in `arr` and the value `k`.
