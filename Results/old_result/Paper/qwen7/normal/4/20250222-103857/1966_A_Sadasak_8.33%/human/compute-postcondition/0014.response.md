Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one less element than before; `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code sets `frequency_table[num]` to `k`. This means that the frequency of `num` in the frequency table is now exactly `k`, regardless of its previous value. The precondition that `arr` must contain at least one less element than before remains unchanged.
