### Reasoning

The original assessment is incorrect because the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of cards that can be achieved through the given operations. Let's break down the issues and provide a corrected approach.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Handling of General Case:**
   - The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table, which is not sufficient. It needs to ensure that the minimum number of cards is calculated by reducing the counts appropriately.
   
2. **Frequency Table Update:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly updates the frequency table to ensure no number appears more than `k` times. However, this alone is not enough to determine the minimum number of cards.

3. **Minimum Number Calculation:**
   - The program needs to calculate the minimum number of cards by considering how many groups of `k` cards can be formed and how to optimally reduce the counts.

#### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Count the frequency of each card.
2. Determine how many groups of `k` cards can be formed.
3. Calculate the remaining cards after forming as many groups as possible.

Here is a revised version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each card
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in nums:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards
    min_cards = 0
    for freq in frequency_table.values():
        min_cards += (freq + k - 1) // k
    
    print(min_cards)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Count the Frequency of Each Card:**
   - We use a dictionary to count the frequency of each card.

2. **Calculate the Minimum Number of Cards:**
   - For each frequency, we calculate how many groups of `k` cards can be formed using the formula `(freq + k - 1) // k`.
   - This formula ensures that we form as many complete groups of `k` cards as possible and count the remaining cards.

### Final Evaluation

Given the corrected approach, the original program is incorrect. The revised program correctly calculates the minimum number of cards that can be achieved through the given operations.

**Final: False**

The original program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of cards.
