Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `ci1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is within the range defined by `1` to `len(path_ba) - ci1` with a step of `2`. This means `i` should be an odd number and it should be less than or equal to `len(path_ba) - ci1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `len(path_ba) - ci1` must be a positive even number.
   - `i` is 7.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by `2` each time, the next value of `i` would be `i + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9`.
   - We need to check if `9` is within the range `1` to `len(path_ba) - ci1`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `9` must be less than or equal to `len(path_ba) - ci1`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be updated to `9`.
   - `len(path_ba) - ci1` must still be a positive even number.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`len(path_ba) - ci1` must be a positive even number, `i` is 9**
