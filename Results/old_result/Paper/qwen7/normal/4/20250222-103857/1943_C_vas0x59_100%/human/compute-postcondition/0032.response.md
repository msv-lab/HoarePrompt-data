Postcondition: **`d` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the result of `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `n` is the value of `-1`, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by `-2`, `v` is one less than the integer from the input decreased by `-3`, and `u2vs[v]` contains all integers from `u-(-2)` to `u-1`; `path_ba` is a list containing `b`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
