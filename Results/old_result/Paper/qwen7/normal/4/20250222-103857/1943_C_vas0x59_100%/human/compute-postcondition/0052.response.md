Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `ci`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < ci + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`
   - `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c, 0)`

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop condition is `i < ci + 1`, the loop will execute once because `i` is currently 0 and `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`.
   - After the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - The value of `ci` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `ci` remains `len(path_ba) // 2`.
   - The state of `ops` does not change as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`, `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c, 0)`**
