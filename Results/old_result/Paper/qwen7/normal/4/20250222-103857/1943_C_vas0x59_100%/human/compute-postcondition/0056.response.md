Output State: `i` is `ci`; `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `ops` is a list containing `ci` tuples, each of the form `(c, index)` where `index` ranges from `0` to `ci-1`.

In this final state, the loop has executed `ci` times, which is equal to half the length of `path_ba`. The variable `i` will be equal to `ci` because the loop increments `i` in each iteration. The list `ops` will contain `ci` tuples, with each tuple consisting of the value `c` and an index ranging from `0` to `ci-1`.
