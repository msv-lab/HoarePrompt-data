Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by 1, `v` is an integer from the input decreased by 1, `u2vs[v]` contains `[u]`**

Explanation: The code `u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes two integers as input, splits them, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `u` and `v`. The value of `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0. The value of `v` is decreased by 1 compared to its initial state, and `u2vs[v]` is updated to contain `[u]`.
