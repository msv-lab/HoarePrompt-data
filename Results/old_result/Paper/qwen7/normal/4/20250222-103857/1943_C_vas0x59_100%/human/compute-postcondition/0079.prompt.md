You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^3, u2vs is a list of length n where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree, and the input format is correct according to the problem description.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by `n-1`, `v` is one less than the integer from the input decreased by `n-2`, and `u2vs[v]` contains all integers from `u-(n-2)` to `u-1` and `v`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `u2vs[v]` will contain a list of all the `u` values that were appended to `v` during the loop's execution, starting from `u-n+2` up to `u-1`. The exact values depend on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
    d, _ = bfs(0)
    a = func_1(d)
    d, previous = bfs(a)
    b = func_1(d)
    path_ba = [b]
    while True:
        n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
        
        if n == -1:
            break
        
        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: Output State: `d` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the result of `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `n` is the value of `-1`, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by `-2`, `v` is one less than the integer from the input decreased by `-3`, `u2vs[v]` contains all integers from `u-(-2)` to `u-1`; `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and all the values that were appended during the loop iterations until `n` became `-1`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to append the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` to `path_ba` as long as `n` (which starts as `previous[path_ba[-1]]`) is not equal to `-1`. After the loop exits, `n` will be `-1`, indicating that the path has ended. Therefore, `path_ba` will contain a sequence of nodes starting from `b` and ending at a node where no further path can be found, which is indicated by `n` being `-1`. The other variables (`d`, `previous`, `b`, `u`, `v`, `u2vs[v]`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    ops = []
    if (len(path_ba) % 2 == 1) :
        ci = len(path_ba) // 2
        c = path_ba[ci]
        for i in range(ci + 1):
            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `ci`; `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `ops` is a list containing `ci + 1` tuples, each in the form `(c, index)`, where `index` ranges from `0` to `ci`.
        #
        #Explanation: The loop runs `ci + 1` times, where `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2. After all iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `ci`. The list `ops` will contain `ci + 1` tuples, with each tuple being `(c, index)`, where `index` starts from `0` and increments by `1` up to `ci`.
    else :
        ci2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        ci1 = ci2 - 1
        c1 = path_ba[ci1]
        c2 = path_ba[ci2]
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2):
            ops.append((c1, i))
            
            ops.append((c2, i))
            
        #State: Output State: `len(path_ba) - ci1` must be a positive even number, `i` is equal to the second last index of `path_ba`, `ops` is a list containing tuples where each tuple consists of either `c1` or `c2` paired with every even index from 1 up to and including the second last index of `path_ba`.
        #
        #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `ops` will contain pairs of `c1` and `c2` with every even index from 1 to the second last index of `path_ba`. The variable `i` will be set to the second last index of `path_ba` since the loop increments by 2 each time and stops just before the last index.
    #State: `i` is equal to `ci`, where `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`. `ops` is a list containing `ci + 1` tuples, each in the form `(c, index)`, where `index` ranges from `0` to `ci` if `len(path_ba) % 2 == 1`. Otherwise, `len(path_ba) - ci` must be a positive even number, `i` is equal to the second last index of `path_ba`, and `ops` is a list containing tuples where each tuple consists of either `c1` or `c2` paired with every even index from 1 up to and including the second last index of `path_ba`.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: i + 1
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: - Given the initial state, `ops` contains tuples where each tuple consists of either `c1` or `c2` paired with every even index from `1` up to and including the second last index of `path_ba`.
    #   - For each tuple `(c, index)` in `ops`, the lambda function will generate a string in the format `'c + 1 index'`.
    #
    #Therefore, the output will be a series of lines, each containing a string in the format `'c + 1 index'` for each tuple in `ops`.
    #
    #Output:
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10³, and a list `u2vs` of length `n` where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree. The function does not return any value and returns None after processing the input.
