Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.**

The initial state is that `t` must be greater than 0. The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`. Since the input is converted to an integer, `n` is now an integer value obtained from user input. The condition about `t` remains unchanged.
