Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `j` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - The first argument to `print` is `2`.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 3, this simplifies to `n - 3 + 1` or `n - 2`.
   - The third argument uses the `*range(1, n + 1)` syntax, which unpacks the range object into individual arguments. This means it will print all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

4. **Putting It All Together**:
   - The first part of the output is `2`.
   - The second part is `n - 2`.
   - The third part is the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

Given these steps, the output will be:

Output: **2, n - 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., n**
