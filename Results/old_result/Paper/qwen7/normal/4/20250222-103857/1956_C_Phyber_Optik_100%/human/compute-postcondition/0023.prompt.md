Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4, `sum` is 30, `i` is 5.

To understand this, let's break down the loop and its effect on the `sum` variable. The loop updates `sum` as follows:

For each iteration \(i\) from 2 to \(n\), the loop adds \((i^2 - (i-1)^2) \times i\) to `sum`.

Simplifying the expression inside the loop:
\[
(i^2 - (i-1)^2) \times i = (i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1)) \times i = (2i - 1) \times i = 2i^2 - i
\]

So, the loop effectively updates `sum` as:
\[
sum = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
\]

We can verify the given states:
- After 1 iteration (`i=2`): 
  \[
  sum = 1 + (2 \cdot 2^2 - 2) = 1 + 6 = 7
  \]
  But the given state shows `sum` as 5, which seems to be a discrepancy based on the provided information. Assuming the pattern holds, we'll proceed with the given states.

- After 2 iterations (`i=3`):
  \[
  sum = 5 + (2 \cdot 3^2 - 3) = 5 + 15 = 20
  \]
  But the given state shows `sum` as 14, indicating a possible error in the problem statement. We'll continue based on the given states.

- After 3 iterations (`i=4`):
  \[
  sum = 14 + (2 \cdot 4^2 - 4) = 14 + 28 = 42
  \]
  But the given state shows `sum` as 18, again indicating a discrepancy. However, we will assume the final state after 3 iterations is correct for the purpose of this calculation.

Given the pattern and the final state after 3 iterations, if the loop runs until `i=5`, then:
\[
sum = 18 + (2 \cdot 5^2 - 5) = 18 + 45 = 63
\]

But the problem states the final `i` is 4, meaning the loop has completed its iterations up to `i=4`. Therefore, the final `sum` should be 18, and the next value of `i` would be 5, but since the loop has ended, `i` remains 4.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4, `sum` is 30, `i` is 5.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
    print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `j` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is 3, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
