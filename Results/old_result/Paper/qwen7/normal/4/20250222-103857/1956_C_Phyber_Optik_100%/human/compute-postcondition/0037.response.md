To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given print statement:

```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **`1`**: This is a constant value and will always be printed as `1`.

2. **`n - j + 1`**: 
   - `n` and `j` are variables whose values are not explicitly provided in the initial state.
   - Therefore, the expression `n - j + 1` represents the difference between `n` and `j` plus one. We cannot simplify this further without knowing the specific values of `n` and `j`.

3. **`*range(1, n + 1)`**: 
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
   - The `*` operator unpacks this range into individual arguments for the `print` function.
   - For example, if `n` is 5, then `range(1, 6)` would generate the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

### Conclusion:

Given the initial state does not provide explicit values for `n` and `j`, the print statement will output `1`, followed by `n - j + 1`, and then the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1, [n - j + 1], 1, 2, ..., n (where [n - j + 1] is the result of n - j + 1 and the sequence is from 1 to n)**
