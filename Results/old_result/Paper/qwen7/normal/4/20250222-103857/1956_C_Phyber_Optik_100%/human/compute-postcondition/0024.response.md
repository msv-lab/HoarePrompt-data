State: **`j` is 5, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 4, and `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4.
2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, where `t` is the number of iterations. Each iteration increments `j` by 1.
3. **Current Iteration**: Since `j` was 4 at the end of the previous iteration, the loop has executed one more time, incrementing `j` to 5.
4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must reach `n`. Since `j` is now 5, the loop will continue if `n` is greater than or equal to 5.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect `j` being incremented to 5, and `n` remaining as an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4 (since it hasn't been modified within the loop).
