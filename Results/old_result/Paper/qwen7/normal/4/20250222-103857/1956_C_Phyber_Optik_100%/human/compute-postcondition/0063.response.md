Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `j` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 4 but no specific value is provided.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Breakdown of the Print Statement**:
   - `1`: This is a constant value.
   - `n - j + 1`: Since `j` is 2, this expression becomes `n - 2 + 1` or `n - 1`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range object into individual arguments starting from 1 up to `n`.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - The first argument is `1`.
   - The second argument is `n - 1`.
   - The third argument onwards are the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

5. **Final Output**:
   - The output will be `1` followed by `n - 1` and then all integers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Given that `n` must be greater than 4, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n` which is 5 for clarity:
- If `n = 5`, the output would be `1 4 1 2 3 4 5`.

However, since `n` can be any number greater than 4, the general form of the output is:
- `1` followed by `n - 1` and then all integers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1 n - 1 1 2 3 ... n**
