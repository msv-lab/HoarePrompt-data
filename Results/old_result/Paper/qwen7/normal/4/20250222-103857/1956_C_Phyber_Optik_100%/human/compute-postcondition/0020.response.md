Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State:
   - `j` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4.

2. Code Snippet:
   ```python
   print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. Breakdown of the Print Statement:
   - `1`: This is directly printed as 1.
   - `n - j + 1`: Given `j` is 3, this expression simplifies to `n - 3 + 1` or `n - 2`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range from 1 to `n` inclusive into individual arguments for the print function.

4. Combining the Parts:
   - The print statement will output three parts separated by spaces: 
     1. The number 1.
     2. The value of `n - 2`.
     3. All numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

5. Final Output:
   - The output will be: `1`, followed by `n - 2`, followed by all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 n-2 1 2 ... (n-1) n** (where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4)
