Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 2` and increments `i` in each iteration.
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
   - `n` is an input integer (unchanged).
   - `sum` is 5 (unchanged).
   - `i` is 2 (unchanged).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i <= n`. Therefore, `i` must be 3 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

Given these points, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 3, `sum` is 5, `i` is 3**
