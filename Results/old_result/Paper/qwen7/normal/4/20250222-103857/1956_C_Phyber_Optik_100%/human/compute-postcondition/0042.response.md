Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `j` from 1 to `n` inclusive. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is `j_prev + 1`
   - `n` must be greater than `j_prev + 1`

4. **Determine the next value of `j`**: Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `j_prev + 2`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `j_prev + 2` must still be less than or equal to `n`.

6. **Adjust the state**: Update `j` to `j_prev + 2` and ensure `n` remains greater than `j_prev + 2`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`j` is `j_prev + 2`, `n` must be greater than `j_prev + 2`**
