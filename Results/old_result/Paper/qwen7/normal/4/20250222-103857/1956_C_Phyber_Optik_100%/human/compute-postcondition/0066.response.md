Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` must be greater than 3 but no specific value is provided for `n`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break it down:

1. `1` is directly printed as 1.
2. `n - j + 1`: Since `j` is 3, this expression simplifies to `n - 3 + 1` or `n - 2`.
3. `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range object into individual numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Given these points, the output will be:

Output: **1, n - 2, 1 2 ... (n-1) n**

Here, `n - 2` is the result of the expression `n - j + 1` with `j` being 3, and the `*range(1, n + 1)` part will print all numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.
