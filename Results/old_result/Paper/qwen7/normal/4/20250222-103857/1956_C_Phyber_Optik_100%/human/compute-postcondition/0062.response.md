Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved in the loop. In this case, the loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
   ```
   The variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: The current state is given as:
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 4

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `j < n` must be true. Given that `j` is currently 1, the loop will continue as long as `1 < n` or simply `n > 1`. Since it is already mentioned that `n` must be greater than 4, the condition `j < n` will always be true as long as `n` remains greater than 4.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 (from 1 to 2). Therefore, `j` will be 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 4.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 4**
