Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(t)` construct. The variables involved here are `t`.

2. **Understand the Loop Execution**: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning the loop condition `t > 0` was true until the last iteration. After the last iteration, the loop has finished executing.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**: Since the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` should be 0 because the loop runs for `t` times and once it reaches 0, the loop stops.

4. **Final State**: Given that the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` must now be 0. The other variables `j`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their last known state.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which is actually the state right after the loop completes) is:

**State: **`sum` is 120, `j` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `t` is 0**.
