Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer is the index (i + 1) of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to that index, starting from 0.**

Explanation: The code `preOne = list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))` creates a new list `preOne` where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to that index, starting from 0. This means that `preOne[i]` will be the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `pre`. The other variables (`totalOne`, `s1`, and `pre`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
