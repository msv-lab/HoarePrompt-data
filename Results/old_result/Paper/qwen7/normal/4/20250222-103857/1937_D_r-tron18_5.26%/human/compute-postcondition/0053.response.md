Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `el` is `s1[n - 3]`, `suffZero` is a list, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i]` by performing a calculation involving several variables. Specifically, `ans[i]` is set to the value of `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. The values of `i`, `el`, `suffZero`, `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, `totalOne`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi` are updated according to the operations described, but their exact numerical values are not specified in the initial state, so they remain as described.
