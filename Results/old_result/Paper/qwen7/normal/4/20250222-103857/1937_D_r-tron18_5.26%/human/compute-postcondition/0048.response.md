Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `el` is `s1[n - 3]`, `suffZero` is a list, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`**

Explanation: The code updates `ans[i]` to be the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd`. Since `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated using `func_1`, `suffZero`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, and their lengths, these values remain unchanged except for the assignment to `ans[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
