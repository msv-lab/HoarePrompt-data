Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `el` is `s1[n - 2]`, `suffZero` is a list with the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `zeroInd` by calculating `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `zeroInd` is now set to this expression. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
