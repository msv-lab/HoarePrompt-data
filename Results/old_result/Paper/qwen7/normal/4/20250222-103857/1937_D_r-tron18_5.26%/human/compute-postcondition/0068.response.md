Postcondition: `i` is `n - 3`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `suffZero` is a list, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are recalculated, `ans[i]` is either `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr <= ol`, or `zeroInd - oneInd` if `zr > ol`, and `fi` is undefined if `el == '>'`.
