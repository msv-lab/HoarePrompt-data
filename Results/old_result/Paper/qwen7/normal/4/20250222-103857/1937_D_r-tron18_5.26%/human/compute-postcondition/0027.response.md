Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `el` is `s1[n - 2]`, and `suffZero` is a list with the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `suffZero`. This new value is calculated as the last element of `suffZero` plus `i + 1`. Since `i` is `n - 2` and `el` is `s1[n - 2]`, and `el` is not '>', the value of `suffZero[-1]` remains unchanged from its previous state. The new value appended to `suffZero` is `suffZero[-1] + (n - 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `suffZero[-1] + n - 1`. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value in `suffZero`.
