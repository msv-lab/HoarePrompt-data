Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `el` is `s1[n - 2]`, `suffZero` is a list with the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` to the variable `zeroInd`. No other variables are affected. The previous values of `i`, `el`, `suffZero`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged.
