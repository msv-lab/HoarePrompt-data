Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `suffZero` is a list, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `oneInd - fi`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`**

Explanation: The code updates `ans[i]` by calculating `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. Since `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `fi`, `n`, and `i` are derived from other variables, they retain their relationships. The other variables (`el`, `suffZero`, `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, `totalOne`) remain unchanged.
