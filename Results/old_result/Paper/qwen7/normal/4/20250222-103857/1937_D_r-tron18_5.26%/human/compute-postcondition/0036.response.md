Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `el` is `s1[n - 2]`, `suffZero` is a list with the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns `2 * preOne[-1]` to the variable `oneInd`. Since `preOne` is a list, `preOne[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `preOne`. The value of `oneInd` is updated based on this, but no other variables are affected. Therefore, the values of `i`, `el`, `suffZero`, `ol`, `zr`, and `zeroInd` remain unchanged from their initial states.
