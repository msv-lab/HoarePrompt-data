Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and an integer `n`. It calculates and stores values in a list `ans` based on the positions of '>' in `s1`. For each character in `s1` from the last to the first, it determines a value to assign to the corresponding position in `ans` based on the counts of '>' and '<' encountered so far. Finally, it prints the contents of `ans`.**
