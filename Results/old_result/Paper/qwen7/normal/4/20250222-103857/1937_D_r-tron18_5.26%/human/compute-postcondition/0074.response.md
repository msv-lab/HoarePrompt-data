Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `suffZero` is a list, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `ol` is now `totalOne`, `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `oneInd` by calculating `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `preOne` is updated by removing its last element, and `ol` and `zr` are reassigned to reflect the new length of `suffZero`.
