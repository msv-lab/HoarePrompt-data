Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `el` is `s1[n - 3]`, `suffZero` is a list with the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `oneInd` to `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The function `func_1` is called with `preOne` and `zr` as arguments, and its result is multiplied by 2 to update `oneInd`.
