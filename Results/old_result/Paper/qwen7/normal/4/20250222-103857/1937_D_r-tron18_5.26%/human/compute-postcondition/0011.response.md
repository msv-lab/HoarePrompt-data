Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `el` is `'> '`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` to the variable `zeroInd`. Since the initial value of `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, and `func_1` is called with `suffZero` and `ol` as arguments, `zeroInd` will be updated to the result of this function call multiplied by 2. The other variables (`i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`) remain unchanged.
