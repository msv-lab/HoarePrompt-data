Postcondition: `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is `s1[n - 2]`, `suffZero` is a list with the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated as follows:
- If `zr <= ol`, then `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- Otherwise, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.
- In both cases, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.
