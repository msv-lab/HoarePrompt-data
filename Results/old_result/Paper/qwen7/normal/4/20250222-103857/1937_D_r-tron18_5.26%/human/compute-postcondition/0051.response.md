Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `el` is `s1[n - 3]`, `suffZero` is a list, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)**

Explanation: The code subtracts the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)` from `oneInd`. Since `oneInd` was previously calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`, after the subtraction, `oneInd` becomes `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
