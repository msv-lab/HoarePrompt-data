Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `suffZero` is a list with the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are recalculated, `el` is assigned the value of `s1[i]`**.

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the `suffZero` list. This new value is calculated as `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`. Since `suffZero[-1]` is the last element in the list before the append operation, the new last element of `suffZero` is the sum of the previous last element, `i`, and 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
