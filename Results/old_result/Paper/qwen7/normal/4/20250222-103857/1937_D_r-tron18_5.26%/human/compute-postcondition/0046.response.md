Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `el` is `s1[n - 3]`, `suffZero` is a list, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`, `oneInd` is recalculated, `el` is now `s1[i]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `zeroInd` by calculating `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`, where `ol` is `totalOne`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The function `func_1` is called with `suffZero` and `totalOne` as arguments, and its result is multiplied by 2 to assign to `zeroInd`. The other variables like `i`, `el`, `suffZero`, `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, `totalOne`, `oneInd`, and the updated `el` are kept as they were before the code execution.
