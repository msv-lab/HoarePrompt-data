Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `suffZero` is a list with the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`. Depending on whether `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are either calculated as `zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` and `oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1)`, or as `zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `oneInd = 2 * (preOne[-2])`. In both cases, `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr <= ol`, or `zeroInd - oneInd` if `zr > ol`, and `ol` and `zr` are updated accordingly.**
