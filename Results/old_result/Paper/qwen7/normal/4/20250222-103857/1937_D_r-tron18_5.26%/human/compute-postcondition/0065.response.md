Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `suffZero` is a list with the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * (preOne[-2])`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.**

Explanation: 
- The variable `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `n - 3`.
- The variable `el` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `s1[i]`.
- The variable `suffZero` remains unchanged as it was initially defined with the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`.
- The variable `ol` is decremented by 1 because `totalOne` is decremented by 1.
- The variable `zr` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- The variable `preOne` is updated by removing its last element.
- The variable `totalOne` is decremented by 1.
- The variable `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`.
- The variable `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * (preOne[-2])`.
- The variable `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `zeroInd - oneInd`.
