Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `suffZero` is a list with the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, `el` is assigned the value of `s1[i]`, `ol` is now `totalOne`, and `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `i` remains unchanged as `n - 4`.
- The variable `el` remains unchanged as `s1[i]`.
- The variable `suffZero` remains unchanged except for its last element, which is `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`.
- The variable `ol` is updated to `totalOne - 1`.
- The variable `zr` is updated to `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- The variable `preOne` is updated by removing the last element.
- The variable `totalOne` is updated to `totalOne - 1`.
- The variable `zeroInd` remains unchanged as `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`.
- The variable `oneInd` is updated to `2 * func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1)`.
- The variable `ans[i]` is assigned the value `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.
- The variable `el` is reassigned the value of `s1[i]`.
- The variable `ol` is updated to `totalOne`.
- The variable `zr` is updated to `len(suffZero) - 1`.
