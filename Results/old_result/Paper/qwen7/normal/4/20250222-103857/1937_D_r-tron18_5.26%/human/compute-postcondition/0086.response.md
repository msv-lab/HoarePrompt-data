Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `suffZero` is a list with the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are recalculated, `el` is assigned the value of `s1[i]`, `ol` is now `totalOne`, and `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the values of `ol` and `zr` to be `totalOne` and `len(suffZero) - 1` respectively. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
