Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the logic implemented in `func_2` correctly calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each query.

1. **Initialization and Preprocessing**:
   - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'.
   - `totalOne` is the count of such indices.
   - `preOne` is the prefix sum of `pre`, initialized with an extra 0 at the beginning.
   - `suffZero` is a list that accumulates the indices where the character is '<' from the end.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - For each position `i` from the end to the start of the string `s1`:
     - If the character is '>', it calculates the time to exit the grid based on the counts of '>' and '<'.
     - If the character is '<', it also calculates the time to exit the grid similarly but considering the suffix zeros.

3. **Calculation Details**:
   - The calculations involve using `func_1` to compute differences in prefix sums, which helps in determining the exact time taken for the pinball to leave the grid based on the current position and the counts of '>' and '<'.

Given the detailed execution summary and the logic described, the function `func_2` appears to correctly implement the rules for calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid. The use of prefix sums and suffix sums, along with the proper handling of the boundary conditions, ensures that the solution is accurate for all possible inputs.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the logic described, the program seems to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
