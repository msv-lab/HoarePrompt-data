Based on the initial state provided, `ans` is a list of elements calculated based on conditions within a loop. However, since no specific conditions or values are given for the elements of `ans`, we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in `ans`.

Therefore, the output will be the elements of `ans` printed in a space-separated format, but without knowing the exact values, we can only describe it as such.

Output: **elements of ans (where each element is calculated based on conditions within the loop)**
