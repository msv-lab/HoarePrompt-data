Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves simulating the movement of pinballs on a one-dimensional grid where each cell contains either '<' or '>'. The direction of movement changes after each move, and the pinball stops once it leaves the grid.

2. **Key Components**:
   - The grid is defined by a string `s1` where each character represents the direction of movement.
   - For each cell, the program calculates how long it takes for a pinball to leave the grid if placed there.
   - The solution uses dynamic programming and prefix sums to efficiently compute these values.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function computes a value based on the prefix sums of a list. However, its usage in `func_2` seems to be misaligned with the problem requirements.
   - **func_2**: This function correctly computes the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. It uses prefix sums and suffix sums to efficiently calculate the required values.

4. **Algorithm Correctness**:
   - The algorithm in `func_2` correctly handles both directions ('<' and '>') and updates the prefix and suffix sums accordingly.
   - The logic for calculating the time taken for each cell is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm handles edge cases where the pinball starts at the boundary cells, ensuring it stops immediately.
   - The dynamic programming approach ensures that the calculations are efficient even for large grids.

6. **Output**:
   - The final output is correctly formatted, printing the time taken for each cell in each test case.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
