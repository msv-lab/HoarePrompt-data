The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is equal to the number of zeros found in the original list starting from the second element, and `a` is a list containing only the non-zero elements from the original list, starting from the second element. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`res` is equal to the number of zeros found in the original list starting from the second element, and `a` is a list containing only the non-zero elements from the original list, starting from the second element, `t` must be greater than 0**
