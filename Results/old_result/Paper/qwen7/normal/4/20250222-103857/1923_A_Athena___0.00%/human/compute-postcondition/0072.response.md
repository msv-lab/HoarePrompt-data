Output State: **`res` is equal to the number of zeros found in the original list starting from the second element, and `a` is a list containing only the non-zero elements from the original list, starting from the second element.**

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `res` will hold the total count of zeros found in the original list starting from the second element. The list `a` will contain only the non-zero elements from the original list, starting from the second element, with no changes to the order or values of these non-zero elements.
