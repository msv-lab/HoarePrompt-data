Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `res` is 0, `a` contains at least one element and its last element is no longer 0**

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` was 0, after executing this line, the last element of `a` is no longer 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
