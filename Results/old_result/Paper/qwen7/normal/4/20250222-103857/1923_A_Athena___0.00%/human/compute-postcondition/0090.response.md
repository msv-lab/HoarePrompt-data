Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `a` is not empty (`a`) and the last element of `a` is 0 (`a[-1] == 0`).

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is 0
   - `a` is a non-empty list where all leading zeros have been removed and the last two elements are 0
   - `t` is greater than 0
   - `n` is an input integer

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop condition involves `a` and `a[-1]`.
   - Since `a` is non-empty and the last two elements are 0, `a[-1]` is 0.
   - For the loop to continue, `a` must still be non-empty and `a[-1]` must still be 0.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `a` must remain non-empty and `a[-1]` must remain 0.
   - Since `a` is non-empty and the last two elements are 0, removing the last element (which is 0) would make `a` non-empty and `a[-1]` would still be 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `a` and `a[-1]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`res` is 0, `a` is a non-empty list where all leading zeros have been removed, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, and `a[-1]` is 0**
