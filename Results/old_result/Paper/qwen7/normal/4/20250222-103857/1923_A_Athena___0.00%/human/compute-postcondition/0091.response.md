Output State: **`res` is 0, `a` is a non-empty list where all leading zeros have been removed and the last element is no longer 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since `a[-1]` was originally 0, after executing `a.pop()`, `a[-1]` will no longer be 0. All other variables (`res`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
