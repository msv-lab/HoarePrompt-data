To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

The loop condition is `a and a[-1] == 0`.

1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop continues as long as `a` is not empty (`a`) and the last element of `a` is 0 (`a[-1] == 0`).

2. **Current State Before Loop**:
   - `res` is 0 (unchanged).
   - `a` is a list where all elements starting from the first one have been removed because they were initially 0.

3. **Loop Head Variables**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `a`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `a` must not be empty (`a`), and the last element of `a` must be 0 (`a[-1] == 0`).

Given that `a` is a list with all elements starting from the first one having been removed because they were initially 0, we need to ensure that the remaining list `a` is not empty and that the last element of `a` is 0.

Since the list `a` has had all its initial elements (which were 0) removed, the list `a` must have at least one element left, and this element must be 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state of `a` needs to be adjusted to ensure that it is not empty and that its last element is 0.

**State:**
- `res` is 0 (unchanged).
- `a` must not be empty and its last element must be 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`res` is 0, `a` must not be empty and its last element must be 0**
