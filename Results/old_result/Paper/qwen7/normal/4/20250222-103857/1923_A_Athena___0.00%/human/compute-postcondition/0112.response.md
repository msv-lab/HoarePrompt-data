Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of the list), and a list `a` of `n` integers (each either 0 or 1). For each test case, it removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a`. Then, it counts the number of zeros remaining in the list and prints the list followed by the zero count. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the final state where `t` is 0, `n` retains its original value, `a` is either empty or contains the remaining non-zero elements, `res` is the total count of zeros from all test cases, and `i` reflects the length of the final list `a`.**
