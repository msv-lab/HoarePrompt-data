You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        print(a)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of the list), and a list `a` of `n` integers (each either 0 or 1). For each test case, it removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a`. Then, it counts the number of zeros remaining in the list and prints the list followed by the zero count. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the final state where `t` is 0, `n` retains its original value, `a` is either empty or contains the remaining non-zero elements, `res` is the total count of zeros from all test cases, and `i` reflects the length of the final list `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` representing the cells.

2. **Removing Leading and Trailing Free Cells:**
   - The program removes leading free cells (`0`s) by popping from the start of the list `a` until the first non-free cell is encountered.
   - It also removes trailing free cells (`0`s) by popping from the end of the list `a` until the last non-free cell is encountered.

3. **Counting the Number of Operations:**
   - After removing the leading and trailing free cells, the program counts the number of free cells (`0`s) in the remaining list `a`. This count represents the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the modified list `a` after removing the leading and trailing free cells.
   - It then prints the count of free cells in the modified list `a`.

### Issues with the Given Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Operations:**
   - The program incorrectly counts the number of free cells (`0`s) in the list `a` after removing leading and trailing free cells. This does not correctly represent the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block.
   - The logic should focus on moving chips to the leftmost possible position, which is not achieved by simply counting free cells.

2. **Misunderstanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires moving chips to the leftmost possible position to form a single block. The current implementation does not simulate the actual movement of chips.

### Correct Approach

To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the process of moving chips to the leftmost possible position. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the index of the rightmost chip
        rightmost_chip_index = None
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            if a[i] == 1:
                rightmost_chip_index = i
                break
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of operations
        res = 0
        for i in range(rightmost_chip_index):
            if a[i] == 1:
                res += rightmost_chip_index - i
        
        print(res)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Finding the Rightmost Chip:**
   - We find the index of the rightmost chip in the list `a`.

2. **Calculating the Minimum Number of Operations:**
   - For each chip to the left of the rightmost chip, we calculate the distance to the rightmost chip and add it to the result.

3. **Output:**
   - Print the result, which is the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the process of moving chips to the leftmost possible position. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
