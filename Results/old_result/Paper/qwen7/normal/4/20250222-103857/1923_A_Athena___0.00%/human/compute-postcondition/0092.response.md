Output State: `res` is 0, `a` is a non-empty list where all leading zeros have been removed and the first element is not 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will no longer start with any zeros. The loop continues to remove elements from the end of the list `a` as long as the last element is 0. This process will continue until `a` no longer ends with any 0s. The variable `res` remains 0 because it is not modified within the loop, and `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
