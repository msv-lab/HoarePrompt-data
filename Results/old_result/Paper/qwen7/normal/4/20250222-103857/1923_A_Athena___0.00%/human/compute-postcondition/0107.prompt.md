Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `res` is 0, `a` is a non-empty list where all leading zeros have been removed and the first element is not 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will have had all its leading zeros removed. Since the loop continues to run as long as the last element of `a` is 0, once the last 0 is removed, the loop will terminate. At this point, `a` will no longer end with any 0s, but it will still be a non-empty list (since the initial state required `a` to be non-empty). The variable `res` remains 0 because it is not modified within the loop. The variables `t` and `n` also remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == 0:
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `res` is 1, `a` is a non-empty list where all leading zeros have been removed and the first element is not 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `res` is 2, `a` is a non-empty list where all leading zeros have been removed and the first element is not 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 1, and the current value of `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`) is still undefined.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `res` is 3, `a` is a non-empty list where all leading zeros have been removed and the first element is not 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 2, and the current value of `a[i]` (which is `a[2]`) is still undefined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
