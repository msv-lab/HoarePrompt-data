Output State: `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1 each time until it reaches a value less than `m`, and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]` for all iterations until the loop condition `j < m and b[j] != a[i]` is no longer satisfied.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will have been incremented multiple times (specifically, as many times as the loop ran), `n` will still be greater than or equal to 1 (assuming it was initially so), `j` will be incremented by 1 each iteration until it either meets or exceeds `m`, and throughout all these iterations, `b[j]` will never be equal to `a[i]`.
