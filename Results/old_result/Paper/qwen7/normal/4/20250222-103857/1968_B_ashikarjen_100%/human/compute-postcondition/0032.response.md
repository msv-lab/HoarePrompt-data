Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 for each iteration until `i` is no longer within the bounds of `a`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is increased by 1, `j + 2` is less than `m`, and `b[j + 2]` is not equal to `a[i]`; `k` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Since `j` was previously increased by 3 for the first 3 iterations and then increased by 1 for each subsequent iteration, the only change here is that `j` is now increased by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
