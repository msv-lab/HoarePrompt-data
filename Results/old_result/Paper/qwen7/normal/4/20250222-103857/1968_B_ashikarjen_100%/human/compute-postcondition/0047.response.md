Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is incremented by 1.**

The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Since `j` was previously incremented by 1 each time until it either meets or exceeds `m`, and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`, the condition for incrementing `j` remains valid. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `k`) are not affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged.
