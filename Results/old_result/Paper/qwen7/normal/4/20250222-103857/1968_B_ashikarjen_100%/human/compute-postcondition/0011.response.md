Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` must be less than `m - 1` and `b[j + 1]` must not be equal to `a[0]`**.

The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 is still valid. The value of `j` is increased by 1, but the exact new value of `j` is not specified. The conditions that `j` must be less than `m - 1` and `b[j + 1]` must not be equal to `a[0]` are still valid after the increment.
