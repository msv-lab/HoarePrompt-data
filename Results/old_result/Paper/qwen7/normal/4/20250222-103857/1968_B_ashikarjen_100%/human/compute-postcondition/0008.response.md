Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head conditions**: The loop condition is `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
   - `j` is increased by 1 and `j` must still be less than `m`
   - `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[0]`

3. **Determine which states need to be adjusted**:
   - The loop head checks two conditions: `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]`.
   - Since `i` is 0, the second condition becomes `b[j] != a[0]`.
   - The first condition `j < m` depends on the value of `j` and `m`.
   - The second condition `b[j] != a[0]` depends on the value of `b[j]`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` is increased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, so `j` is now `j + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j + 1` must be less than `m` (to satisfy `j < m`).
   - Additionally, `b[j + 1]` must not be equal to `a[0]` (to satisfy `b[j] != a[0]`).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `b[j + 1]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` must be less than `m - 1` and `b[j + 1]` must not be equal to `a[0]`**
