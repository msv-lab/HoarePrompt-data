Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1 to `j + 1` and must now be less than `m`, and `b[j + 1]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.**

This means that `j` has been incremented by 1, and all other conditions and constraints remain the same as before the code execution.
