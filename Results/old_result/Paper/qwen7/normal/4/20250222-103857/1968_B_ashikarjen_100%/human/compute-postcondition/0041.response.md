Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]`.
2. **Determine the current state**:
   - `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m`.
   - `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]` must be true.
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `j + 1` must be less than `m` (i.e., `j + 1 < m`), and `b[j + 1]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The current value of `j` is such that `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be incremented to `j + 1`, and the new value of `j` must still satisfy the conditions.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `j` must be incremented to `j + 1` and must still be less than `m` and `b[j + 1]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1 to `j + 1` and must be less than `m`, and `b[j + 1]` must not be equal to `a[i]`**
