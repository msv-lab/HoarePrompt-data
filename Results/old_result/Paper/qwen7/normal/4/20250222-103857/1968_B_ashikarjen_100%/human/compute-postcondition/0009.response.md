Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` must be less than `m - 1` and `b[j + 1]` must not be equal to `a[0]`; `j` is increased by 1.**

The value of `j` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. The conditions for `n`, `j`, and the relationship between `b[j + 1]` and `a[0]` are preserved.
