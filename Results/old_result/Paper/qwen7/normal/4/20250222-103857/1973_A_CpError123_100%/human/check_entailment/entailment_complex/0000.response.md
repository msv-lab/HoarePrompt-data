Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case individually.
2. **Sum Check**: The function correctly checks if the sum of the scores `a + b + c` is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case, which is correct because an odd sum cannot be achieved through the given scoring system.
3. **Calculation of `x` and `y`**: The function calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2` and `y` as `a + b`. These calculations are based on the fact that the total points distributed among the three players should be even, and the maximum possible number of draws is calculated using these values.
4. **Output**: The function prints the minimum of `x` and `y`, which represents the maximum possible number of draws. This is correct because each draw gives 1 point to each player, and the maximum number of draws would be the minimum of the total points divided by 2 and the sum of the points of the two lowest-ranked players.
5. **Loop Termination**: The loop correctly terminates when all test cases have been processed, and the function does not produce any output after the loop, which is appropriate.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
