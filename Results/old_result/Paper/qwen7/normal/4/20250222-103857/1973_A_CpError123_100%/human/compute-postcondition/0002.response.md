Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
