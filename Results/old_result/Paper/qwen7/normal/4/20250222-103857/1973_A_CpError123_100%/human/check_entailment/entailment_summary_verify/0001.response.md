### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores of the three players.
   - This part is correct.

2. **Check for Consistency**:
   - The program checks if `(a + b + c) % 2 == 0`. This condition ensures that the total number of points scored is even, which is necessary because each game contributes either 2 points (to the winner) or 2 points split between two players (in case of a draw).
   - If this condition fails, the program prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because an odd total score is inconsistent with the rules of the game.
   - This part is correct.

3. **Calculate Maximum Draws**:
   - If the total score is even, the program calculates `x = (a + b + c) // 2`, which represents half of the total points scored.
   - It then calculates `y = a + b`, which is the sum of the points of the two players with the lowest scores.
   - The program prints `min(x, y)`, which should be the maximum number of draws. This logic is based on the observation that the maximum number of draws can be calculated by considering the sum of the points of the two players with the lowest scores and ensuring that the remaining points are distributed as draws.
   - This part is almost correct but has an issue with the specific case `1 1 2`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the scores are all zero (`0 0 0`) correctly by printing `0`.
   - The program also handles the case where the scores are `0 1 1` correctly by printing `1`.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where the scores are `1 1 2` correctly. According to the problem statement, the scores `1 1 2` are inconsistent because it is impossible to achieve these scores through a series of games under the given rules. The program should print `-1` for this case, but it prints `2` instead.
   - The program also incorrectly handles the case `3 4 5`. The correct maximum number of draws for these scores is `6`, but the program prints `6` which is correct. However, the logic used to calculate the maximum number of draws is flawed for the case `1 1 2`.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because it fails to handle the specific case `1 1 2` correctly. The program should print `-1` for this case, but it prints `2`. Additionally, the logic used to calculate the maximum number of draws is flawed for certain cases, leading to incorrect results.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
