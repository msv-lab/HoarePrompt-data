Output State: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, `x` is equal to `(a + b + c) // 2`, `y` is equal to `a + b`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) and `t` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the value of `y` to `a + b`. Since `y` was previously defined as `a + b`, this assignment does not change the value of `y`. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, `t`) remain unchanged. The condition that the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd also remains valid.
