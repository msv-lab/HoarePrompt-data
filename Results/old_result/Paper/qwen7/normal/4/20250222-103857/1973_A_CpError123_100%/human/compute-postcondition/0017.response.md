Output State: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, `x` is equal to \((a + b + c) // 2\), `y` is equal to `a + b`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) and `t` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code sets `x` to the integer division of the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` by 2, which is already defined in the precondition. It also keeps `y` as `a + b` and decrements `t` by 1, maintaining its range constraint.
