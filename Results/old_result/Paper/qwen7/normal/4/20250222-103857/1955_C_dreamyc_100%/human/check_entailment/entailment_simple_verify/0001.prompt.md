You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is `n`, `s_b` is the sum of the last `n // 2` elements of `nums` (or the sum of the last `n // 2 + 1` elements if `n` is odd), `i` is `n - 1`, `s_a` is the sum of the first `n // 2` elements of `nums` (or the sum of the first `n // 2 - 1` elements if `n` is odd).
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `n - 1` because the loop increments `i` from `0` to `n - 1`. The variable `s_a` accumulates the sum of the first half of the list `nums` (or the first half minus one element if `n` is odd), and `s_b` accumulates the sum of the second half of the list `nums` (or the second half plus one element if `n` is odd). The variable `ans` is incremented each time either `s_a` or `s_b` is less than or equal to their respective thresholds `a` and `b`. Since the loop iterates over all elements of `nums`, `ans` will be equal to `n` if every prefix sum of the first half and the suffix sum of the second half satisfy their conditions.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is equal to `n` because every prefix sum of the first half and the suffix sum of the second half of the list `nums` satisfied their respective conditions during the loop iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Problem**: The problem involves simulating the attacks of the Kraken on a sequence of ships with varying durability. The Kraken attacks in a specific pattern: alternating between the first and last ship until all ships are sunk or the attacks are exhausted.

2. **Analyze the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`, followed by the durability of each ship.
   - It calls a function `func_1` to compute the number of sunk ships and prints the result.

3. **Examine the Function `func_1`**:
   - The function checks if `k` is greater than or equal to the total durability of all ships. If true, it returns `n` because all ships would sink.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of attacks on the first and last ships separately (`a` and `b`).
   - It then iterates through the durability list, keeping track of the cumulative durability for the first and last ships.
   - The function increments the answer `ans` whenever the cumulative durability for either the first or last ship is less than or equal to the corresponding number of attacks (`a` or `b`).

4. **Identify Potential Issues**:
   - The logic for counting the sunk ships seems flawed. Specifically, the function incorrectly counts the number of sunk ships by checking if the cumulative durability is less than or equal to the number of attacks, which doesn't accurately simulate the Kraken's attack pattern.
   - The function should simulate the actual attack pattern more closely, reducing the durability of ships and tracking which ships sink.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Simulate the Kraken's attacks by iterating through the list and reducing the durability of the first and last ships alternately.
   - Keep track of the number of sunk ships and stop when there are no more attacks left or no more ships to attack.

Given these observations, the current implementation is incorrect because it does not properly simulate the Kraken's attack pattern.
