Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is 0, `s_b` is `nums[n - 1]`, `i` is 0, `s_a` is `nums[0]`**.

Explanation: The code updates `s_b` by adding the element `nums[n - i - 1]` to `s_b`. Since `i` is initially 0, `n - i - 1` simplifies to `n - 1`. Therefore, `s_b` is now equal to `nums[n - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
