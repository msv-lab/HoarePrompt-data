Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5. `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15. `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function returns either the value of `n` or `ans`, which is equal to `n` if every prefix sum of the first half and the suffix sum of the second half of the list `nums` satisfy their respective conditions during the loop iterations.**
