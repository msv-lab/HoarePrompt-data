Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is 0, `s_b` is 0, `i` is 0, `s_a` is `nums[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `s_a += nums[i]` increments the value of `s_a` by the value of `nums[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `s_a` is updated to be the first element of the list `nums`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
