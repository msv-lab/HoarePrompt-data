Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is 2, `s_b` is `nums[n - 1]`, `i` is 0, `s_a` is `nums[0]`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was initially set to 1, after executing this line, `ans` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
