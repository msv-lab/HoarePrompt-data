Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is `n`, `s_b` is the sum of the last `n // 2` elements of `nums` (or the sum of the last `n // 2 + 1` elements if `n` is odd), `i` is `n - 1`, `s_a` is the sum of the first `n // 2` elements of `nums` (or the sum of the first `n // 2 - 1` elements if `n` is odd).

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `n - 1` because the loop increments `i` from `0` to `n - 1`. The variable `s_a` accumulates the sum of the first half of the list `nums` (or the first half minus one element if `n` is odd), and `s_b` accumulates the sum of the second half of the list `nums` (or the second half plus one element if `n` is odd). The variable `ans` is incremented each time either `s_a` or `s_b` is less than or equal to their respective thresholds `a` and `b`. Since the loop iterates over all elements of `nums`, `ans` will be equal to `n` if every prefix sum of the first half and the suffix sum of the second half satisfy their conditions.
