The function accepts a 2D list `l` as input and returns a 2D list `p`. The returned list `p` has dimensions `(n+1) x (m+1)`, where `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the input list `l`. The element `p[n+1][m]` contains the sum of all elements in the list `l` plus adjustments for overlapping regions, while all other elements in `p` retain their original values from the initial state.
