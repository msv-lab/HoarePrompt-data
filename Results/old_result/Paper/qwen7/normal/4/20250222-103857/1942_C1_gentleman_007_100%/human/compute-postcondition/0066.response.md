Output State: **All nodes that are reachable from the starting node `ver` have been visited, and `q` contains the original elements plus all the nodes that were added to it during the loop iterations.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, all nodes that are reachable from the starting node `ver` will have been visited, as indicated by the `vis` list where every reachable node will have `vis[node]` set to 1. The queue `q` will contain the original elements plus all the nodes that were added to it during the loop iterations, which are all the nodes that are reachable from the starting node and have not been visited before.
