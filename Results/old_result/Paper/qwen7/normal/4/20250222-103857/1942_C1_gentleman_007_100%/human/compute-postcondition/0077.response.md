Output State: **`i` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `j` is `len(b)`, the `dp` matrix contains the lengths of the longest common subsequences for all pairs `(a[k], b[l])` where `0 <= k < len(a)` and `0 <= l < len(b)`, `l` is a list containing `a[i]`, and `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, and `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`**.

Explanation: The code appends `a[i]` to the list `l`. The values of `i`, `j`, `dp`, and the condition regarding `dp[i][j]` remain unchanged. The list `l` now includes the element `a[i]`.
