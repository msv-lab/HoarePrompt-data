Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` is a deque() instance with `ver` appended to it; `vis[ver]` is set to 1
Code of the loop:
while len(q):
    ver = q.popleft()
    print(ver, end=' ')
    for node in graph[ver]:
        if not vis[node]:
            q.append(node)
            vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: All nodes that are reachable from the starting node `ver` through the graph's edges have been visited (i.e., `vis[node] == 1` for all such nodes), and these visited nodes are stored in the deque `q`. The deque `q` contains all the nodes that were added during the iterations of the loop, ensuring that each node is visited exactly once if it is reachable from the starting node.

This means that starting from the initial node `ver`, the loop continues to explore all connected nodes in the graph until no more unvisited nodes are found. The deque `q` accumulates all these nodes as they are visited, and the `vis` dictionary ensures that each node is marked as visited once it has been processed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: All nodes in the graph that are reachable from the starting node `ver` have been visited, and `q` is empty.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: All nodes that are reachable from the starting node `ver` have been visited, and `q` contains the original elements plus all the nodes that were added to it during the loop iterations.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
