Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is the first element in the deque `q`, and `q` is updated to remove the first element. All nodes that are reachable from the starting node `ver` through the graph's edges have been visited (i.e., `vis[node] == 1` for all such nodes).
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ver` is the first element in the deque `q`, and `graph[ver]` must contain at least one unvisited neighbor. If `vis[node]` is currently `False`, then after executing the if statement, `q` now contains the elements `[ver, node]`, and `vis[node]` is set to `True`. If `vis[node]` is already `True`, the condition remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `q` contains the node that was appended, `ver` is the first element in the deque `q`, `vis[ver]` is set to 1, and `graph[ver]` must contain at least one unvisited neighbor.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `q` now contains the node that was appended plus the previously appended node, `ver` is the next unvisited neighbor in `graph[ver]`, `vis[node]` is set to 1, and `graph[ver]` must contain at least one unvisited neighbor.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
