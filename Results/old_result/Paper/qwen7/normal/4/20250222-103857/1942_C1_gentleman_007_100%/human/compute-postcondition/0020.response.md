Output State: **`graph[ver]` must contain at least one element, `node` is the next element from `graph[ver]`, `vis[node]` is 1, and `q` contains the node**.

Explanation: The code sets `vis[node]` to 1, indicating that the node has been visited. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
