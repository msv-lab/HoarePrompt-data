Output State: **`graph[ver]` must contain at least one element, `node` is the next element from `graph[ver]`, `vis[node]` is True, and `q` contains the node**.

Explanation: The code `q.append(node)` appends the value of `node` to the list `q`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `graph[ver]` still must contain at least one element, `node` is still the next element from `graph[ver]`, and `vis[node]` is still True. The list `q` now includes the node.
