d is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to n and values are non-negative integers such that the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. However, this function does not seem to be directly related to the main problem described. It appears to be a separate utility function that calculates a sum based on the input dictionary.
