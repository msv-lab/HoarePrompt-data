You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

    #State: Output State: `i` is `0`, `j` is `len(b)`, the `dp` matrix contains the lengths of the longest common subsequences for all pairs `(a[k], b[l])` where `0 <= k < len(a)` and `0 <= l < len(b)`, `l` is either an empty list or a list containing elements from `a` up to index `i`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be `0` because the loop continues to decrement `i` until it reaches `0`. The value of `j` remains `len(b)` because whenever `dp[i][j]` does not equal `dp[i][j - 1]`, `j` is set to `len(b)`. The `dp` matrix retains its computed values from the longest common subsequence calculations. The list `l` will contain elements from `a` up to the index `i` (which is `0`), so it will either be an empty list or contain the last element added during the loop's iterations.

def func_23(arr):
    l = []
    for i in arr:
        pos = bisect_left(l, i)
        
        if pos == len(l):
            l.append(i)

#Function 24:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is an integer representing a vertex of the polygon, and graph is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices. The variable vis is a list or array of boolean values indicating whether a vertex has been visited, with the same length as the number of sides of the polygon (n).
def func_24(ver):
    stack = []
    stack.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1

                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: Output State: The `stack` will be empty because all nodes reachable from the initial vertex (`ver`) have been processed. The `vis` list will have all elements corresponding to the vertices in the graph set to 1, indicating that every vertex has been visited. The `ver` variable will hold the last vertex that was processed, and the `graph` dictionary will remain unchanged as it was initially provided.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, every vertex in the graph that is reachable from the initial vertex will have been visited, and the `stack` will be empty since there are no more nodes to process. The `vis` list marks all vertices as visited, and the `graph` structure remains the same.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: 
def func_25(ver):
    q = deque()
    q.append(ver)

        ver = q.popleft()

        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                q.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: Output State: All nodes that are reachable from the starting node `ver` in the graph have been visited, and the deque `q` is empty.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, all nodes in the graph that can be reached from the starting node `ver` have been visited at least once. The deque `q` is now empty because all nodes that were added to it during the loop iterations have been processed. This means that the loop has successfully traversed the entire connected component of the graph starting from `ver`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using the given vertices. The key observation here is that any convex polygon can be divided into triangles by drawing non-intersecting diagonals.
2. **Key Observation**: For a polygon with \( n \) vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is \( n - 2 \). This is because each triangle uses 3 vertices, and we need to use all \( n \) vertices exactly once.
3. **Given Constraints**: 
   - \( n \) (number of sides of the polygon) ranges from 4 to \( 10^9 \).
   - \( x \) (number of vertices already chosen by Bessie) ranges from 2 to \( \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) \).
   - \( y \) (maximum number of additional vertices you can choose) is 0 in this version of the problem.
4. **Solution Approach**: Since \( y = 0 \), Bessie cannot choose any additional vertices. Therefore, the maximum number of triangles Bessie can form is limited to the number of triangles that can be formed using the \( x \) vertices she has already chosen. However, since \( x \geq 2 \), the minimum number of vertices required to form a triangle is 3. Hence, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using \( x \) vertices is \( x - 2 \) if \( x \geq 3 \). If \( x = 2 \), no triangles can be formed.
5. **Implementation Check**: The given code does not implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Instead, it defines numerous utility functions that are not used in solving the specific problem at hand. The relevant logic should directly compute the maximum number of triangles based on the given constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. It lacks the necessary logic to determine the maximum number of triangles based on the given constraints.
