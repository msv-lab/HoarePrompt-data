Output State: **`i` is a non-zero integer decremented by 1, `j` is `len(b)` decremented by 1, the `dp` matrix contains the lengths of the longest common subsequences for all pairs `(a[k], b[l])` where `0 <= k < len(a)` and `0 <= l < len(b)`, `l` is either an empty list or a list containing `a[i]`, and if `dp[i][j]` equals `dp[i][j - 1]`, then no change is made to `i` and `j`. Otherwise, `i` is decremented by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `i` is decremented by 1 since it was a non-zero integer. The value of `j` is also decremented by 1 as it was originally `len(b)`. The conditions regarding the `dp` matrix and the lists remain unchanged.
