The function accepts three parameters: `n`, the number of sides of the polygon; `m`, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen; and `v`, a list of `m` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. After executing, it returns a 2D list where each row contains the list of `m` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, repeated `n` times.
