Output State: **`q` now contains the elements `[ver, node]`, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one unvisited neighbor, `node` is a neighbor of `ver` in the graph, and `vis[node]` is currently `False`.**

Explanation: The code `q.append(node)` appends the value of `node` to the deque `q`. Since `q` initially contained only the first element `ver`, after appending `node`, `q` now contains both `ver` and `node`. The conditions regarding `graph[ver]`, `node` being a neighbor of `ver`, and `vis[node]` remaining `False` remain unchanged.
