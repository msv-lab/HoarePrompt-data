Output State: All nodes that are reachable from the starting node `ver` through the graph's edges have been visited (i.e., `vis[node] == 1` for all such nodes), and these visited nodes are stored in the deque `q`. The deque `q` contains all the nodes that were added during the iterations of the loop, ensuring that each node is visited exactly once if it is reachable from the starting node.

This means that starting from the initial node `ver`, the loop continues to explore all connected nodes in the graph until no more unvisited nodes are found. The deque `q` accumulates all these nodes as they are visited, and the `vis` dictionary ensures that each node is marked as visited once it has been processed.
