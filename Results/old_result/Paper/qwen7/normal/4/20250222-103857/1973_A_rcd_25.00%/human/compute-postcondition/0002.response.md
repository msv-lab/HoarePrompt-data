Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the user input separated by spaces and assigns them to the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still must be greater than 0.
