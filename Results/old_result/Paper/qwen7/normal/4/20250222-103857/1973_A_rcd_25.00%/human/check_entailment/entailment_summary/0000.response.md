Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
3. It checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If not, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case, which is correct because the total score must be even for the given scoring rules.
4. If the sum is even, it proceeds to calculate the maximum possible number of draws.
5. The logic for calculating the maximum number of draws seems to be flawed. Specifically:
   - The condition `if p3 >= p1 + p2:` is not sufficient to determine the maximum number of draws.
   - The calculation `(low, high) = (min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2))` does not correctly represent the number of draws.
   - The while loop and the conditions inside it do not accurately reflect the scoring system and the maximum possible number of draws.

Given the provided examples and the nature of the problem, the current implementation does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws.

Correctness: **False**
