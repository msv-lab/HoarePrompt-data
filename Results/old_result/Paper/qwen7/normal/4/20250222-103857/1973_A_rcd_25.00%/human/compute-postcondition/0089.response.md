Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is updated to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is updated to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is set to `high`, and `cur` is increased by 1.**

This means that the current value of `cur` has been incremented by 1. All other variables (`t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high`) retain their previously calculated values based on the initial conditions.
