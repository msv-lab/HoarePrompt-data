Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
   - `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 < p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 > p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`.
   - `cur` must be less than or equal to `high`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(p1 - cur + p3)
   ```

Given these conditions, let's determine the value of `p1 - cur + p3`:

- Since `cur` must be less than or equal to `high`, and `high` is either `p3 - p1` or `p3 - p2`, `cur` can take any value between `0` and `high` inclusive.
- The expression `p1 - cur + p3` simplifies to `p1 + p3 - cur`.

To find the exact value, we need to consider the constraints on `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`:

- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. This means one of them must be odd and the other two even, or vice versa.
- `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`. This gives us a relationship between `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

Without specific values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, we can only express the result in terms of these variables. However, since `cur` can vary but is constrained by `high`, the expression `p1 + p3 - cur` will range from `p1 + p3` (when `cur = 0`) to `p1 + p3 - high` (when `cur = high`).

Since the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not provided, we can't determine a single numerical value for the expression. However, we can describe the output in terms of the variables involved.

Output: **p1 + p3 - cur (where cur is a value between 0 and high, and high is either p3 - p1 or p3 - p2)**
