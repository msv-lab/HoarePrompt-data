Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low`, `high`, and `cur` retain their values from the previous iteration, we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and `cur` remain unchanged. The precondition that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd also remains valid.
