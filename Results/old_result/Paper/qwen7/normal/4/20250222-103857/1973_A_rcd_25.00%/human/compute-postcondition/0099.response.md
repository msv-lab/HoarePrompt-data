Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is updated to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is updated to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is set to either `low` or `high` depending on whether `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, `cur` is increased by 1 if it was set to `high`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or if statement it is within. Since no further operations are specified after the `break`, the values of the variables remain as they were before the `break`.
