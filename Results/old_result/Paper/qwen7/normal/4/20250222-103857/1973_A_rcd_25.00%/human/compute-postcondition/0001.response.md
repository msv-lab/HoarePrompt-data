State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop uses `range(t)` to determine how many times it will iterate.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be a positive integer.
3. Since `t` is given as an input integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), the minimum value `t` can take is 1.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.
