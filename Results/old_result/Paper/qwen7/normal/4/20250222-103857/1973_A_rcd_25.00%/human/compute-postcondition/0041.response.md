Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low`, `high`, and `cur` are as calculated in the previous iteration, `p1` is the first integer input, `p2` is the second integer input, `p3` is the third integer input.**

Explanation: The code `p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The conditions about `t`, `low`, `high`, and `cur` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet. The new variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are assigned the integer values from the input, and the condition that their sum is odd remains valid.
