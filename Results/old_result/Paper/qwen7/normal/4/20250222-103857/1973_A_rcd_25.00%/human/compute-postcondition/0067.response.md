Output State: **`cur` is equal to `high` - 1**

Explanation: The initial state is that `cur` is less than `high`. After executing `cur += 1`, `cur` is incremented by 1. Since `cur` was initially less than `high`, incrementing it by 1 makes it equal to `high - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
