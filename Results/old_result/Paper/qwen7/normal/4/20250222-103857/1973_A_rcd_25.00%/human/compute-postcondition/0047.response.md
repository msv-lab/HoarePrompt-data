Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is set to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is set to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.**

This means that after executing the given code snippet, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` remain as per the initial conditions, except that `low` is now the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is now the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
