To determine what will be printed, let's break down the expression `p1 - cur + p3`:

- `p1` is a variable whose value is not explicitly provided.
- `cur` is a variable whose value is not explicitly provided.
- `p3` is a variable whose value is not explicitly provided.

Given that none of the variables (`p1`, `cur`, `p3`) have explicit values provided in the initial state, we cannot determine their specific values. Therefore, the expression `p1 - cur + p3` will remain as it is, without any simplification.

Output: **p1 - cur + p3**
