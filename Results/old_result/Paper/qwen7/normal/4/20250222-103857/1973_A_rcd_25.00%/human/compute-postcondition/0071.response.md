Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`. After all iterations, `cur` will eventually reach a value where `high < cur`, which triggers the `else` block, causing the program to print `p3`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the value of `cur` will be equal to `high`, and since the loop condition `high >= cur` will no longer be true, the loop will exit. As a result, the program will print the value of `p3`.
