Based on the initial state provided:

- `xylist` is a list of strings, where each string is split into two elements (a string for `x` and a string for `y`).
- `x` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the first element of each `xylist`.
- `y` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the second element of each `xylist`.
- `i` is 1.

When the code snippet `print(y[i], ' ', x[i])` is executed, it will print the value at index `i` of the `y` list followed by a space, and then the value at the same index `i` of the `x` list.

Since `i` is 1, the code will print the first element of the `y` list and the first element of the `x` list.

Output: **y[1] x[1]**
