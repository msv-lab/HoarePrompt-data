Reasoning:
- The problem description specifies that there will be `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100. Each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y`, both between 0 and 9.
- The annotated program incorrectly reads 10 pairs of integers instead of reading `t` pairs. This can be seen from the loop that runs 10 times (`for i in range(10)`), which is not aligned with the problem statement.
- The program should read `t` lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y`, and then process each test case individually.
- The logic inside the loop is correct for comparing and printing the minimum and maximum of each pair of integers `x` and `y`.

Given these points, the program as annotated is incorrect because it does not correctly read the number of test cases specified in the input. It reads a fixed number of 10 pairs instead of reading `t` pairs.

Correctness: **False**
