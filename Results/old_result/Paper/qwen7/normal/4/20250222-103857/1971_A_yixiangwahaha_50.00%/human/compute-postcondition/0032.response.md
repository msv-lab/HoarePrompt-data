Based on the initial state provided:

- `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input.
- `x` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the first element of each `xylist`.
- `y` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the second element of each `xylist`.
- `i` is 2.

The `print(x[i], ' ', y[i])` statement will access the third element (index 2) of both lists `x` and `y`.

Therefore, the output will be the third element of `x` followed by a space and then the third element of `y`.

Output: **x[2] y[2]**
