Output State: **`xylist` is a list of strings split from the input; `x` is the list `xylist` with the first element converted to an integer appended to it; `y` is the list `x` with the second element converted to an integer appended to it; `i` is `k + 2`; the first element of `x` is an integer; the second element of `x` is an integer; the third element of `x` is the integer version of the first element of `xylist`.**

Explanation: The code `x.append(int(xylist[0]))` appends the integer version of the first element of `xylist` to the list `x`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
