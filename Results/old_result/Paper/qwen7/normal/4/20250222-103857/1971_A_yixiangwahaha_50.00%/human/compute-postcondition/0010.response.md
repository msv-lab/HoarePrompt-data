Output State: **`xylist` is a list of strings split from the input; `x` is the list `xylist` with the first element converted to an integer appended to it; `y` is the list `x` with the second element converted to an integer appended to it; `i` is `k + 1` and the first element of `x` is an integer; `y` is the list `x` with the second element converted to an integer appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the integer version of the second element of `xylist` to the list `y`. Since `y` was already the list `x` with the second element of `xylist` converted to an integer appended to it, appending the same value again does not change `y`. All other variables remain unchanged.
