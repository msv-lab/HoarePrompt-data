Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input format specified in the problem description. According to the problem description, the input should be read from standard input, and the first line should contain the number of test cases `t`, followed by `t` lines each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y`. However, the program reads `t` from input but then proceeds to read 10 fixed pairs of integers, which does not match the expected input format. This mismatch will cause the program to fail for any input that does not consist of exactly 10 pairs of integers, making the program incorrect.
