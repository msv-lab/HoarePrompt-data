Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the input format specified in the problem description. The problem states that the first line contains the number of test cases `t`, and each subsequent line contains two space-separated integers `x` and `y`. However, the program incorrectly assumes that there will be exactly 10 pairs of integers (from indices 0 to 9) instead of reading `t` pairs of integers.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x = int(xylist[0])
        y = int(xylist[1])
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)

func()
```

This corrected version reads the number of test cases `t` first, then processes each test case individually, which aligns with the problem description.
