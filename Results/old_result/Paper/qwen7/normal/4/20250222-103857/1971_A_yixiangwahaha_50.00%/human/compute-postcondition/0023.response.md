Based on the initial state provided:

- `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input.
- `x` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the first element of each `xylist`.
- `y` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the second element of each `xylist`.
- `i` is 0.
- `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]`.

When the code snippet `print(y[i], ' ', x[i])` is executed, it will print the value of `y[i]` followed by a space and then the value of `x[i]`.

Since `i` is 0, `y[i]` corresponds to the first element of the `y` list, and `x[i]` corresponds to the first element of the `x` list. Given that `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]`, the exact values are not specified but we know their relationship.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **y[0] [space] x[0]** (where `y[0]` is the first element of the `y` list and `x[0]` is the first element of the `x` list, and `x[0]` is greater than or equal to `y[0]`)
