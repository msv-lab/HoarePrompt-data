Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
        
    #State: `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input; `x` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the first element of each `xylist`; `y` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the second element of each `xylist`; `i` is 9 (since the loop runs from 0 to 9, inclusive).
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all 10 iterations. The variable `i` is now 10. For each iteration, the code compared the values of `x[i]` and `y[i]` and printed either `x[i]` followed by `y[i]` or `y[i]` followed by `x[i]` based on which value was smaller. After all iterations, the lists `x` and `y` remain unchanged because the loop only prints values and does not modify `x` or `y`. The `xylist` also remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
