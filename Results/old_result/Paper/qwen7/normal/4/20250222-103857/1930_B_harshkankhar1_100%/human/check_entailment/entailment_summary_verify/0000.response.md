### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary step-by-step to validate the original assessment.

1. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` takes no explicit arguments but relies on the global input.
   - It creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `t` (where `t` is the number of test cases).
   - It reverses every second element starting from the first element.
   - It prints the modified list.

2. **Program Execution**:
   - The main loop iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it creates a list `a` with integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It reverses every second element in the list `a`.
   - It prints the modified list.

3. **Verification of Correctness**:
   - We need to check if the generated permutation satisfies the condition: there should not exist two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i\) divides \(p_{j+1}\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j}\).

4. **Testing Specific Cases**:
   - For \(n = 4\):
     - The list `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
     - Reversing every second element gives `[4, 2, 3, 1]`.
     - Checking pairs: 
       - \(4 \nmid 2\)
       - \(2 \nmid 3\)
       - \(3 \nmid 1\)
       - \(1 \nmid 4\)
     - All conditions are satisfied.
   - For \(n = 3\):
     - The list `a` is `[1, 2, 3]`.
     - Reversing every second element gives `[3, 2, 1]`.
     - Checking pairs:
       - \(3 \nmid 2\)
       - \(2 \nmid 1\)
       - \(1 \nmid 3\)
     - All conditions are satisfied.

5. **General Case Analysis**:
   - For any \(n\), the list `a` will be `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
   - Reversing every second element will result in a list where the odd-indexed elements are in descending order and the even-indexed elements are in ascending order.
   - This ensures that no two adjacent elements in the permutation satisfy the divisibility condition because the odd-indexed elements (which are larger) cannot divide the even-indexed elements (which are smaller).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly generates a permutation that satisfies the given condition. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function, and the provided examples and general analysis confirm the correctness of the program.

**Final: True**
