Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `a` is a list where every second element starting from the first (index 0) is reversed, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.**

Explanation: The code `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses every second element of the list `a`, starting from the first element (index 0). This means that elements at even indices in the original list are now in reverse order. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
