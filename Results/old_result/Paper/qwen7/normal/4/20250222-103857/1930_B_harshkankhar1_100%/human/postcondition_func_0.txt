The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( t \) and an integer \( n \). It then creates a list of integers from 1 to \( t \), reverses every second element starting from the first, and prints the modified list. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints a list based on the input parameters.
