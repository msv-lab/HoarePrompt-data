Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each test case, the function determines whether the conditions for t and n are met and returns appropriate results based on these conditions.**

This means the function `func_1` indirectly accepts parameters through a series of test cases, each containing a value for `t` and `n`, and checks if these values meet the specified constraints. It then returns results based on whether these conditions are satisfied for each test case.
