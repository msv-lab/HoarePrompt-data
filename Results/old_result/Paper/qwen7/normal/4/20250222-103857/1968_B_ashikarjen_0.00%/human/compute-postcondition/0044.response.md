Output State: **`j` is equal to `j + 1`, `m` is greater than `j`, `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`, and `j + 1` is less than `m` and `b[j + 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`**.

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The conditions involving `m`, `b[j]`, `a[i]`, and `b[j + 1]` remain unchanged because they were not directly affected by the operation `j += 1`.
