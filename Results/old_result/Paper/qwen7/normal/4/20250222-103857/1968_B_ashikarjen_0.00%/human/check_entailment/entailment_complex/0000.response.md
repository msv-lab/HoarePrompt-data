Reasoning:

1. **Function Logic Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` correctly reads the input values for each test case.
   - It initializes `k` to 0 and `j` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character of string `a` using index `i`.
   - Inside the loop, it uses a while loop to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in string `b` starting from index `j`.
   - If a match is found, it increments both `k` and `j`.
   - If no match is found within the bounds of `b`, it breaks out of the loop.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `k`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `a` is a subsequence of `b` correctly.
   - It also correctly handles cases where `a` is not a subsequence of `b` and stops at the first mismatch.
   - The function correctly prints 0 after processing all test cases, which is consistent with the problem statement.

3. **Output Validation**:
   - The provided example outputs match the expected results based on the logic of the function.
   - The function prints the correct count of matching prefixes for each test case.

Given the analysis, the function `func_1()` correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
