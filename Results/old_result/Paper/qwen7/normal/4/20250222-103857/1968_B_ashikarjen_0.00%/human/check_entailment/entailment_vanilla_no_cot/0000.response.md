Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1()` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum prefix length `k` of string `a` that forms a subsequence of string `b`. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `k` to 0 and `j` to 0. `k` will store the length of the prefix of `a` that matches a subsequence in `b`, and `j` will iterate through `b`.

2. **Iterate Through String `a`**: The function uses a loop to go through each character in string `a`.

3. **Find Matching Character in String `b`**: For each character in `a`, it searches for a matching character in `b` starting from the current position `j`.

4. **Update Count and Position**: If a match is found, it increments both `k` and `j` to move to the next character in `a` and the next character in `b`. If no match is found, it breaks out of the loop since further characters in `a` cannot form a subsequence in `b`.

5. **Output Result**: Finally, it prints the value of `k`.

This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`. The logic handles all the given constraints and examples accurately.
