Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is less than `m`.
   - `b[j + 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`.

3. **Determine What Needs to Change**:
   - For the loop to continue, both parts of the condition (`j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]`) must be true.
   - Since `j` is already less than `m`, we don't need to change this part.
   - We need to ensure that `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]` for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - The only way to ensure the loop continues is to change the value of `b[j]` so that it is not equal to `a[i]`.
   - However, since we cannot directly change `b[j]` without knowing its exact value, we need to ensure that the condition `b[j] != a[i]` holds true for the next iteration.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]` for the next iteration. Since `b[j + 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, we can infer that `b[j]` should not be equal to `a[i]` either to ensure the loop continues.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`**
