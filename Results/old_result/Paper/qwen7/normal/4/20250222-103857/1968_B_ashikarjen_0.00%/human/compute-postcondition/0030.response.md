Output State: `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than 0, for every index `i` where `i` ranges from `0` to `m-1`, `b[i]` must not be equal to `a[i]`, and `i` is `n`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will eventually reach or exceed `m`. The condition `j < m` in the while loop will no longer be satisfied, causing the loop to terminate. At this point, `j` will be equal to `m` because it keeps incrementing until the condition fails. The other conditions remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
