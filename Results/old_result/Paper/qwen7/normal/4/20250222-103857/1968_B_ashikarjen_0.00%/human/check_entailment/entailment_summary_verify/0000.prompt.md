You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Output

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \), followed by two binary strings \( a \) and \( b \) of lengths \( n \) and \( m \) respectively. It then counts the number of positions where the characters in \( a \) and \( b \) match and prints this count. After processing all test cases, the function prints 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum prefix length `k` such that the first `k` characters of string `a` form a subsequence of string `b`. The program iterates through each character of string `a` and checks if it exists in string `b` while maintaining the order. If a character is found, it increments the counter `k` and moves to the next character in `b`. If a character is not found, the loop breaks, and the current value of `k` is printed.

Given the problem description and the examples, the program handles all potential cases correctly. It ensures that the characters of `a` are checked in order and only increments `k` when a matching character is found in `b`. The program also correctly handles cases where no matching subsequence is found, resulting in `k` being 0. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for all given inputs and potential cases.
