Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is assigned the value of the first space-separated integer input; m is assigned the value of the second space-separated integer input; a is a string containing the input; b is a string containing the input from the latest `input()` call.**

In this scenario, the code `b = input()` reads a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
