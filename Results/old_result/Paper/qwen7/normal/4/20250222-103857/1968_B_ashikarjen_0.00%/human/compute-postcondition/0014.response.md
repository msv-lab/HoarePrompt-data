Output State: `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than 0, and for every index `i` where `i` ranges from `0` to `m-1`, `b[i]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will have reached the value of `m`, indicating that either the loop has iterated through all elements of `b` without finding a match with `a[i]` for any `i`, or it has found a match but continued to iterate until `j` equals `m`. Additionally, `m` must still be greater than 0, and no character in `b` up to index `m-1` should match the corresponding character in `a`.
