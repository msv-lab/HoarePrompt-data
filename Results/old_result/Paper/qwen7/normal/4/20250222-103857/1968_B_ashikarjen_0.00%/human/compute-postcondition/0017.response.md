Output State: **`j` is equal to `m` + 1, `m` is greater than 0, and `k` is increased by 1; for every index `i` where `i` ranges from `0` to `m-1`, `b[i]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Since `j` was initially equal to `m`, after executing the code, `j` becomes `m + 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
