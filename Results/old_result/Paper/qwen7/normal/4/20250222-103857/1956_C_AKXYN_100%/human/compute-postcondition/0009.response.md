Output State: **`res` is 28, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3**

Explanation: The initial value of `res` is 6. The code updates `res` by adding the value of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to it. Given that `i` is 3, we calculate `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` as follows: `(3 + 1) * (2 * 3 + 1) = 4 * 7 = 28`. Therefore, `res` is updated to `6 + 28 = 34`. However, since the exact value of `t` and the condition on `n` remain unchanged, they are included in the output state as they were initially. The value of `i` remains 3.
