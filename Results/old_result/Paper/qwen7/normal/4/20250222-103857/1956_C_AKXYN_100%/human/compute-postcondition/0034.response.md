Output State: **`res` is 36, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 4**.

Explanation: The value of `res` is updated by adding \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\) to its current value. Given that `i` is 4, we substitute `i` into the expression:

\[
(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) = (4 + 1) * (2 * 4 + 1) = 5 * 9 = 45
\]

So, `res` is updated from 24 to \(24 + 45 = 36\). The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
