Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `res` is 204.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). The specific value of `t` is not needed for this print statement.
   - `n` is 6.
   - `i` is 4.
   - `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to 6. The specific content of `mat` is not needed for this print statement.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement is `print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))`.

3. **Breakdown of the Print Statement:**
   - `'2 %d' % i`: This part of the string uses string formatting. Since `i` is 4, it will replace `%d` with `4`, resulting in the string `'2 4'`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range object into individual arguments. Given `n` is 6, `range(1, 7)` generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. Unpacking this sequence will result in the individual numbers being printed as separate arguments.

4. **Combining the Parts:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'2 4'` followed by the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2 4 1 2 3 4 5 6**
