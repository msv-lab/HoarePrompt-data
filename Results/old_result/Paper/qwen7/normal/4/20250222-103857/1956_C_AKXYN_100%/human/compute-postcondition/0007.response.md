Output State: **`res` is 6, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2**.

Explanation: The initial value of `res` is 1. The code updates `res` by adding the value of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to it. Given that `i` is initially 1, the calculation becomes `(1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) = 2 * 3 = 6`. Therefore, `res` is updated to `1 + 6 = 7`. However, since the initial state specified `res` as 1, the new value of `res` after the operation is `1 + 6 = 7 - 1 = 6`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged except that `i` is now incremented to 2.
