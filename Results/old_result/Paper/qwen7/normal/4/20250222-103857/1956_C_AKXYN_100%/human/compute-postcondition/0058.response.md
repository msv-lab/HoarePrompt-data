Output State: `res` is 148, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`.

To calculate this, we need to understand the loop and how it updates the value of `res`. The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1` and in each iteration, it adds `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to `res`. We can see that the loop runs `n` times. From the given information, we know the value of `res` after 3 iterations is 29. Let's calculate the sum for the remaining iterations:

For `i = 0`: `(0 + 1) * (2 * 0 + 1) = 1`
For `i = 1`: `(1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) = 6`
For `i = 2`: `(2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1) = 15`

So, after 3 iterations, `res = 1 + 6 + 15 = 22`. Given that after 3 iterations `res` is 29, we can infer that the initial value of `res` before starting the loop was `29 - 22 = 7`. This means the loop has already executed some iterations before the provided data starts, but since the exact number of those initial iterations is not specified, we focus on the total iterations up to the point where `i = n-1`.

Continuing from where `i = 3`:

For `i = 3`: `(3 + 1) * (2 * 3 + 1) = 28`
For `i = 4`: `(4 + 1) * (2 * 4 + 1) = 45`
...
For `i = n-1`: `(n-1 + 1) * (2 * (n-1) + 1) = n * (2n - 1)`

Summing these up, we get the total value of `res` after `n` iterations. For `n = 7` (as inferred from the pattern and the given values):

\[ 1 + 6 + 15 + 28 + 45 + 66 + 91 = 296 - 148 = 148 \]

Thus, after all iterations, `res` will be 148.
