Given the initial state:
- `res` is 204
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `i` must be greater than or equal to 0

We need to determine what will be printed by the following code snippet:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break down the components of the print statement:

1. `'2 %d' % i`: This part of the print statement uses string formatting. It will replace `%d` with the value of `i`. Since `i` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, let's denote it as `i_value`.

2. `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range object into separate arguments. The range function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, let's denote it as `n_value`.

Combining these parts, the print statement will output a string that starts with "2" followed by the value of `i` (denoted as `i_value`), and then a space-separated list of numbers starting from 1 up to `n_value`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2 i_value 1 2 ... n_value** (where `i_value` is the value of `i` and `n_value` is the value of `n`)
