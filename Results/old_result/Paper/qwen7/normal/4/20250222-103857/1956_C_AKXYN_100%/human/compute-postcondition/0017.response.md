Given the initial state:
- `res` is 204
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `i` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break down the components of the print statement:

1. `'1 %d' % i`: This part of the string will be formatted to include the value of `i`. The `%d` is a placeholder for an integer, so it will be replaced with the value of `i`.

2. `*range(1, n + 1)`: The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` inclusive. The `*` operator unpacks this sequence into separate arguments for the `print` function.

Since `i` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, let's consider a specific example to illustrate the output. For simplicity, let's assume `i = 3` and `n = 5` (these values satisfy the conditions).

The formatted string `'1 %d' % i` would become `'1 3'` when `i = 3`.

The `range(1, n + 1)` would generate the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

So, the `print` statement would output:
```
1 3 1 2 3 4 5
```

Output: **1 [i] 1 2 ... [n]** (where [i] is the value of `i` and [n] is the value of `n`)
