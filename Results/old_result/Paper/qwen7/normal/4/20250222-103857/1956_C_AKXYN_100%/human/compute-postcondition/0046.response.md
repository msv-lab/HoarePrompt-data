Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `res` is explicitly given as 140.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). However, this variable is not used in the print statement.
   - `n` is explicitly given as 7.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 5.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))`.

3. **Breaking Down the Print Statement**:
   - `'2 %d' % i`: This part formats the string with the value of `i` inserted into the string. Since `i` is 5, this becomes `'2 5'`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range object into separate arguments. Given `n` is 7, `range(1, 8)` generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`. When unpacked, it will be treated as individual arguments.

4. **Combining the Parts**:
   - The formatted string `'2 5'` is combined with the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` into a single print statement.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **2 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7**
