Output State: **`s` is 1 if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is `@`; otherwise, `s` is 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `b` is the same as before, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is the same as the initial value, and `d` is the same as before and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the loop or if statement has been broken out of, but the values of `s`, `j`, `b`, `i`, `a`, and `d` remain as they were in the initial state, except that `i` has been incremented by 1.
