Postcondition: `s` is 0, `b` is a non-empty input string, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is the same as the initial value, `d` is an input integer, and if the current character `b[j]` is '*', or the next character `b[j + 1]` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken; otherwise, no changes occur.
