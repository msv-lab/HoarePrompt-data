Output State: **`s` is 2, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is an index within the string `b` where `b[j]` equals '@' or `j` is 1 if `s` is 0, `d` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The value of `s` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `b`, `j`, and `d` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the executed code.
