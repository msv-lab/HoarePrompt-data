Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `a`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < a`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is 0
   - `b` is the same non-empty string as the initial state
   - `j` is the last index where `b[j]` equals '@'
   - `d` is the input integer

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `i` and `a`, we need to update `i` to `i + 1`.
   - `a` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.
   - `s`, `b`, `j`, and `d` are not part of the loop head and thus remain the same.

Given that the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration, if the loop is to continue, `i` must be less than `a`.

5. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - Therefore, if `i` was previously `k`, it will now be `k + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `k + 1` must be less than `a`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `a` or `i` from the previous iteration, we can only express the state in terms of the updated `i`.

**Final State**:
State: **`s` is 0, `b` is the same non-empty string as the initial state, `j` is the last index where `b[j]` equals '@', `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is the same as the initial value**
