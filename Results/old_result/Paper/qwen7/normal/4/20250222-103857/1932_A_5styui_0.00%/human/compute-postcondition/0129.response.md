Postcondition: `s` is 1 if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is either `@` or `*`; otherwise, `s` is 0, `j` is incremented by 1, `b` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` remains the same as the initial value, and `d` remains the same as before, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
