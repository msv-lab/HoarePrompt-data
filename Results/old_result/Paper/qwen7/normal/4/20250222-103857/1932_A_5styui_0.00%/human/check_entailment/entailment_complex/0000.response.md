Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the maximum number of coins (`@`) that can be collected while moving from the leftmost cell to the right, with the constraints that you can move one or two cells at a time and cannot move onto a cell with thorns (`*`).
- The provided function `func()` does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. Instead, it simply counts the number of `@` characters in each input string without considering the movement rules and thorns.
- The function does not handle the movement logic, which is crucial for determining the maximum number of coins that can be collected. It also does not account for the fact that you can skip thorns or make optimal moves to maximize coin collection.
- Therefore, the function does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
