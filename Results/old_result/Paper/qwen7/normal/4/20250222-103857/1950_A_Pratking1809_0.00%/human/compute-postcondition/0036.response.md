Functionality: **The function processes `q` sets of three integers (`a`, `b`, `c`) within the range 0 to 9. For each set, it checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR', if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK'. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'. After processing all sets, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each set.**
