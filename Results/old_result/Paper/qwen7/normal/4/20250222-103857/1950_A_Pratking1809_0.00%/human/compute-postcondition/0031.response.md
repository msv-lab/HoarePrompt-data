Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `q` must be at least 1.
- `mn` is 100.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `c` is an input integer.
- The condition `a < b < c` holds true.
- `i` is `q + 1`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('NONE')
```

The `print` statement here directly outputs the string `'NONE'`. Since no other variables or conditions affect this output, the value printed is simply the string `'NONE'`.

Output: **NONE**
