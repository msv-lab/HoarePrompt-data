Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `q` must be at least 1.
- `mn` is 100.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
- The current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` do not satisfy the condition `a < b > c`.

The `print('NONE')` statement simply prints the string `'NONE'`.

Output: **NONE**
