Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `q` must be at least 1, `mn` is 100, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and after the execution of the if-else block, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` either satisfy the condition `a < b > c` or they do not satisfy it.
