Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` must be at least 1, `mn` is 100, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and `i` is `q + 1`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `c` is the third input integer. If `a < b < c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds. Otherwise, the condition does not hold.
