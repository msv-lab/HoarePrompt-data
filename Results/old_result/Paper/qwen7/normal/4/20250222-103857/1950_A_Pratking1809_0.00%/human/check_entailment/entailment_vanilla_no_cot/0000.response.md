Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has an issue with how it processes multiple test cases. The variables `mn`, `a`, `b`, and `c` should be reset for each test case, but they are not. This leads to incorrect results for multiple test cases because the values from the previous test case might still be used.

To fix this, you need to initialize `a`, `b`, and `c` inside the loop that processes each test case. Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that `a`, `b`, and `c` are re-initialized for each test case, thus correctly processing all test cases independently.
