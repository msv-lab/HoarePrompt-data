Reasoning:
1. The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `q`.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case.
3. For each set of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it checks two conditions:
   - `a < b < c` to determine if the numbers form a stair.
   - `a < b > c` to determine if the numbers form a peak.
4. The function prints 'STAIR' if the first condition is true, 'PEAK' if the second condition is true, and 'NONE' if neither condition is met.
5. However, there is an issue with the logic in the function. The variables `mn` and the subsequent check for `mn` are not used and do not affect the outcome of the program. More importantly, the function should handle all three possible outcomes for each test case, but the current implementation does not properly handle the case where neither a stair nor a peak is formed.

Given the example provided, the function should work correctly for the given test cases. However, the logic can be simplified and made more clear:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for _ in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This corrected version ensures that all three conditions are checked properly and handles the 'NONE' case explicitly.

# Overall, the original function logic is correct but can be simplified. Given the provided code, it will produce the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
