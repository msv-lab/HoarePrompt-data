Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` must be at least 1, `mn` is 100, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and `i` is `q + 1`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `c` is the third input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The other variables (`t`, `q`, `mn`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
