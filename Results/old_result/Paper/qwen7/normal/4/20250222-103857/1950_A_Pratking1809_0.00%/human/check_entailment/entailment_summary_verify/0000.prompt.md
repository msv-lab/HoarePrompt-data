You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `q` sets of three integers (`a`, `b`, `c`) within the range 0 to 9. For each set, it checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR', if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK'. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'. After processing all sets, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each set.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the conditions for a stair and a peak. Specifically, the conditions for checking if the digits form a stair or a peak are not properly implemented. The current implementation uses a single `if` statement for both conditions, which will cause the program to print "STAIR" or "PEAK" for both conditions if either of them is met, instead of checking both conditions separately.

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

Input:
```
1 3 2
```

Expected Output:
```
PEAK
```

Actual Output:
```
STAIR
```

The program should check both conditions independently and print "PEAK" since `1 < 3 > 2`. However, due to the current implementation, it incorrectly prints "STAIR" because the first condition `a < b < c` is not met, but the second condition `a < b > c` is also not met, so it defaults to printing "STAIR" without considering the correct condition.
