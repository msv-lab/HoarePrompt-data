Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers assigned the values from the input split, `a` is less than or equal to `c`, `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, and the current value of `x` is odd, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `l` the value of the maximum of 1 and `d - x`. Since `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2 and is currently odd, `d - x` will be calculated using the current value of `d` and `x`. The value of `l` will be `d - x` if `d - x` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise it will be 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
