Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) and is equal to the original value of `t` minus 1.
- `r` is the minimum of `w` and either `d + x` (if `x` is odd) or `b + x` (if `x` is even).
- `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, and `l` keep their original values.
- `l` is the maximum of 1 and either `d - x` (if `x` is odd) or `b - x` (if `x` is even).
- `r` is assigned the value of `int(input().split()[0])`.
- `w` is assigned the value of `int(input().split()[1])`.
- `a` is assigned the value of `int(input().split()[2])`.
- `b` is assigned the value of `int(input().split()[3])`.
- `c` is assigned the value of `int(input().split()[4])`.
- `d` is assigned the value of `int(input().split()[5])`.

The `print('Draw')` statement will simply print the string "Draw" without any additional context or variables being evaluated.

Output: **Draw**
