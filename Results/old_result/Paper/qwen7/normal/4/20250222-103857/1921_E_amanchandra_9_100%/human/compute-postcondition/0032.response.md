Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) and is equal to the original value of `t` minus 1.
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `b + x`.
   - `w` is the value of the first input integer.
   - `a` is the value of the second input integer.
   - `b` is the value of the third input integer.
   - `c` is the value of the fourth input integer.
   - `d` is the value of the fifth input integer.
   - `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2.
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   ```python
   print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - Calculate `x`: 
     \[
     x = \frac{|a - c|}{2}
     \]
   - Calculate `r`:
     \[
     r = \min(w, b + x)
     \]
   - Calculate `l`:
     \[
     l = \max(1, b - x)
     \]

4. **Condition Check:**
   - Evaluate the condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x`:
     - `abs(l - d) <= x` checks if the absolute difference between `l` and `d` is less than or equal to `x`.
     - `abs(r - d) <= x` checks if the absolute difference between `r` and `d` is less than or equal to `x`.

5. **Output Determination:**
   - If both conditions are true, the expression `(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[0]` will be evaluated, which results in `['Draw']`.
   - If either condition is false, the expression `(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[1]` will be evaluated, which results in `['Bob']`.

Given the conditions and the structure of the code, the output will depend on the specific values of `l`, `d`, and `r`. However, without specific values for `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `w`, and `x`, we cannot determine the exact boolean outcome of the conditions.

Thus, the output will be either `['Draw']` or `['Bob']` depending on the evaluation of the conditions.

Output: **['Draw'] or ['Bob']**
