Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `t` is set to the original value of `t` minus 2.
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`.
   - `w` is the value of the first input integer.
   - `a` is the value of the second input integer.
   - `b` is the value of the third input integer.
   - `c` is the value of the fourth input integer.
   - `d` is the value of the fifth input integer.
   - `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2.
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`.
   - `r` is updated to be the minimum of `w` and `d + x`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - First, let's determine the values of `l` and `r`:
     - `x = abs(a - c) / 2`
     - `d - x` could be positive, negative, or zero, but since `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`, `l` will be either `d - x` if it is greater than or equal to 1, or 1 otherwise.
     - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`.
   - Next, we need to evaluate the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`:
     - `abs(l - b) <= x + 1` checks if the absolute difference between `l` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.
     - `abs(r - b) <= x + 1` checks if the absolute difference between `r` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.
   - If both conditions are true, the expression `(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[condition]` will return `['Alice']`, otherwise it will return `['Draw']`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the exact values of `l`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact boolean outcome of the condition. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either `'Draw'` or `'Alice'`.

Given the nature of the problem and the lack of specific values, the output will depend on the condition being evaluated. Therefore, the output can be either `'Draw'` or `'Alice'`.

Output: **['Draw', 'Alice'][boolean condition]**
