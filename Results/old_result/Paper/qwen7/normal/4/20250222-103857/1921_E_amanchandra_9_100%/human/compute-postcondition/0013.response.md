Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`.
   - `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers assigned the values from the input split.
   - `a` is less than or equal to `c`.
   - `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2.
   - The current value of `x` is odd.
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`.

2. **Calculating `x`:**
   - Since `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, and `x` is odd, let's assume specific values for `a` and `c` to illustrate. For example, if `a = 3` and `c = 7`, then `x = |3 - 7| / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2`, but since `x` must be odd, we adjust to `a = 3` and `c = 6`, so `x = |3 - 6| / 2 = 3 / 2 = 1.5`, rounding down gives `x = 1`.

3. **Calculating `l`:**
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`. Given `x = 1`, `l` will be `max(1, d - 1)`. If `d` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` will be `d - 1`. If `d` is less than 1, `l` will be 1.

4. **Determining `r`:**
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`. Since `x = 1`, `r` will be `min(w, d + 1)`.

5. **Evaluating the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is: `print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1])`
   - We need to evaluate the condition inside the square brackets: `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`
     - Let's assume specific values for `b`, `w`, and `d` to illustrate. Suppose `b = 2`, `w = 3`, and `d = 4` (these values are chosen to satisfy the conditions and make the evaluation clear).
     - With these values, `l = max(1, 4 - 1) = 3` and `r = min(3, 4 + 1) = 3`.
     - Now, `abs(l - b) = abs(3 - 2) = 1` and `abs(r - b) = abs(3 - 2) = 1`.
     - The condition becomes `1 <= 1 + 1 and 1 <= 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `True and True`, which is `True`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - Since the condition evaluates to `True`, the expression inside the square brackets `[True]` is selected, which is `['Draw']`.
   - The `*` operator is used to unpack the list, so the print statement will output `Draw`.

Output: **Draw**
