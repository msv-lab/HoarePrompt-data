Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Initial Comparison**: The function correctly identifies the base case where \(x_a > x_b\) and prints 'Draw'. This logic is accurate.

3. **Range Calculation**:
   - When \(x_a \leq x_b\), the function calculates the possible range for \(x\) based on the difference between \(a\) and \(c\).
   - If the difference is odd, it calculates the range for \(x\) considering the maximum and minimum column values.
   - If the difference is even, it calculates the range similarly but with respect to \(b\) and \(d\).

4. **Win Conditions**:
   - For an odd difference, it checks if the opponent's column (\(b\) or \(d\)) falls within the calculated range. If it does, it prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' accordingly.
   - For an even difference, it performs a similar check but with the opposite column value.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as when the calculated range for \(x\) is out of bounds (i.e., less than 1 or greater than \(w\)).
   - The logic for determining the win condition based on the position of the opponent's chip is sound.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code correctly implements the rules and logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the function behaves as expected for all given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
