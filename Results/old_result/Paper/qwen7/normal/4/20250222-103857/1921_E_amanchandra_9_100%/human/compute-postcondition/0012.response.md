Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers assigned the values from the input split, `a` is less than or equal to `c`, `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, and the current value of `x` is odd, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `r` to be the minimum of `w` and `d + x`. The values of `t`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, and `l` remain unchanged except for `r`, which is now set to the minimum of its original value and `d + x`. The conditions regarding the relationships between the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, and `l` also remain valid.
