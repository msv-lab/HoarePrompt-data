Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `r` is the minimum of `w` and either `d + x` or `b + x` depending on whether `abs(a - c) % 2` is true or false. If `abs(a - c) % 2` is true (i.e., `x` is odd), then `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`. Otherwise, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.
