You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (r, w, a, b, c, d) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if a > c:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(a - c) // 2
            if abs(a - c) % 2:
                l = max(1, d - x)
                r = min(w, d + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, b - x)
                r = min(w, b + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers \(h\), \(w\), \(x_a\), \(y_a\), \(x_b\), and \(y_b\). For each test case, it compares \(x_a\) and \(x_b\). If \(x_a > x_b\), it prints 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates the possible range for \(x\) based on the difference between \(a\) and \(c\). Depending on whether this difference is odd or even, it determines a range for \(x\) and checks if \(b\) or \(d\) falls within this range. Based on these conditions, it prints either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob'. After processing all test cases, the function prints nothing and ends.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining the winner is flawed. Let's consider a few test cases:

1. **Test Case**: `6 5 2 2 5 3`
   - Alice starts at (2, 2), Bob at (5, 3).
   - Alice can move down, down-right, or down-left. Bob can move up, up-right, or up-left.
   - Alice can move to (3, 2), (3, 1), or (3, 3). Bob can move to (4, 3), (4, 2), or (4, 4).
   - If Alice moves to (3, 2), Bob can move to (4, 3), and so on. The program incorrectly determines the result based on the relative positions without considering the optimal moves.

2. **Test Case**: `4 1 2 1 4 1`
   - Alice starts at (2, 1), Bob at (4, 1).
   - Alice can only move down to (3, 1). Bob can move up to (3, 1).
   - Since both players can move to the same cell, the game should end in a draw. However, the program incorrectly prints "Alice".

The program fails to account for the optimal moves and the game rules correctly. Therefore, it is not fully correct.
