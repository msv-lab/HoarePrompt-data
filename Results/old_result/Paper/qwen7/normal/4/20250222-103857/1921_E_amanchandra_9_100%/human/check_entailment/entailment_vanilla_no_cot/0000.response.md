Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the outcome of the game based on the given rules. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Initial Position Comparison**: The program checks if Alice's initial row position (`a`) is greater than Bob's initial row position (`c`). If so, it immediately prints "Draw" because Alice cannot reach Bob's initial position.
3. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the absolute difference between Alice's and Bob's initial row positions (`abs(a - c)`).
4. **Even and Odd Distance Handling**:
   - If the distance is odd, it calculates the possible column range for Alice's moves (`l` and `r`) and checks if Bob's initial column position falls within this range.
   - If the distance is even, it calculates the possible column range for Bob's moves (`l` and `r`) and checks if Alice's initial column position falls within this range.
5. **Win Condition Check**: Depending on whether the calculated ranges include the opponent's initial column position, it determines if Alice or Bob can win or if the game is a draw.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly identifies the outcome for each test case as specified in the example. Therefore, the provided solution is correct.
