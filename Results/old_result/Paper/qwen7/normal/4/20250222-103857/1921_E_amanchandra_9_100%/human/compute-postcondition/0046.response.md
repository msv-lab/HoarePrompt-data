Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `t` is equal to the original value of `t` minus 2.
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `b + x`.
   - `w` is the value of the first input integer.
   - `a` is the value of the second input integer.
   - `b` is the value of the third input integer.
   - `c` is the value of the fourth input integer.
   - `d` is the value of the fifth input integer.
   - `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2.
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Calculate `x`**:
   \[
   x = \frac{|a - c|}{2}
   \]

2. **Calculate `r`**:
   \[
   r = \min(w, b + x)
   \]

3. **Calculate `l`**:
   \[
   l = \max(1, b - x)
   \]

4. **Evaluate the Condition**:
   \[
   \text{Condition} = (|l - d| \leq x) \land (|r - d| \leq x)
   \]

5. **Determine the Output**:
   - If the condition is true, the output will be `['Draw']`.
   - If the condition is false, the output will be `['Bob']`.

### Detailed Calculation:

- Let's assume the inputs are:
  - `w = 10`
  - `a = 5`
  - `b = 8`
  - `c = 3`
  - `d = 6`

- Calculate `x`:
  \[
  x = \frac{|5 - 3|}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1
  \]

- Calculate `r`:
  \[
  r = \min(10, 8 + 1) = \min(10, 9) = 9
  \]

- Calculate `l`:
  \[
  l = \max(1, 8 - 1) = \max(1, 7) = 7
  \]

- Evaluate the condition:
  \[
  |7 - 6| \leq 1 \quad \text{(True)}
  \]
  \[
  |9 - 6| \leq 1 \quad \text{(False)}
  \]

Since one part of the condition is false, the overall condition is false.

### Final Output:
Output: **['Bob']**
