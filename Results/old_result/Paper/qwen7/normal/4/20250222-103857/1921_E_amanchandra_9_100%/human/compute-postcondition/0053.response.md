Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers \(h\), \(w\), \(x_a\), \(y_a\), \(x_b\), and \(y_b\). For each test case, it compares \(x_a\) and \(x_b\). If \(x_a > x_b\), it prints 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates the possible range for \(x\) based on the difference between \(a\) and \(c\). Depending on whether this difference is odd or even, it determines a range for \(x\) and checks if \(b\) or \(d\) falls within this range. Based on these conditions, it prints either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob'. After processing all test cases, the function prints nothing and ends.**
