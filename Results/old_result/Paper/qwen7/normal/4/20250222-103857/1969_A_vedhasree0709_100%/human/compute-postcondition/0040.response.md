Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[n-2]`, `q` is `l[l[n-2] - 1]`, `l` is updated to a new list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `l`. This updates the value of `l` but does not affect the other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`, `p`, `q`).
