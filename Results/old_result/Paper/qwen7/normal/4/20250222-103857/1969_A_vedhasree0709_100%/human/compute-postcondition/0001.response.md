Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, which is that they can hold any values. Since the initial state only mentions `n` as being assigned by an integer input, the output state is that `n` is an input integer.
