Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`.
2. **Determine the current state**:
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `j` is currently 0.

3. **Check the loop condition with the current state**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`.
   - Currently, `i` is 0, so we need to ensure that `0 <= n - 1` is true.
   - This simplifies to `n - 1 >= 0`, which means `n >= 1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time.
   - No other states need adjustment because they do not affect the loop condition directly.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 0**
