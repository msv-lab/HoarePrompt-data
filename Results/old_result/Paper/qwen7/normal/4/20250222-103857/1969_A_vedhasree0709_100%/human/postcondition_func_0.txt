The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list \( p \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it checks if there exists an index \( i \) (where \( 0 \leq i < n \)) such that the element at index \( p[i] - 1 \) in the list equals \( i + 1 \). If such an index is found, the function prints 2 and breaks out of the loop. If no such index exists after checking all possible \( i \), the function prints 3. The function does not return any value but outputs the result for each test case.
