Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `p` is `l[n-1]`, `q` is `l[l[n-1] - 1]`, `j` is 0, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, `i` will always be equal to `n`, `p` will be the last element of the list `l`, `q` will be the element at the index `l[n-1] - 1` in the list `l`, and `j` will be 0, assuming the condition `j == 0` was true when the if statement was executed. If the condition `j == 0` was false, `j` would remain unchanged (either 1 or 0).
