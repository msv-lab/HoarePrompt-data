Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[n-1]`, `q` is `l[p - 1]`, and if `q` equals `i + 1`, we break out of the loop; otherwise, `i` reaches `n`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches `n`. During each iteration, it checks if `q` (which is `l[p - 1]`) equals `i + 1`. If this condition is met for any `i`, the loop breaks and sets `j` to 1. Since `j` is initially set to 1 and remains unchanged unless the condition inside the loop is met, `j` will stay as 1 after the loop completes. The final value of `i` will be `n`, and the values of `p` and `q` will be based on the last index checked, which is `n-1`.
