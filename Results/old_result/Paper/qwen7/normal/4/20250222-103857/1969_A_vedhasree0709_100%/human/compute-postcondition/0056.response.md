Output State: **`i` is 1, `p` is `l[1]`, `q` is `l[0]`**

Explanation: The code `q = l[p - 1]` updates the value of `q` to be the element at index `p - 1` in the list `l`. Given that `p` is initially `l[1]`, substituting `p` into the expression gives `q = l[l[1] - 1]`. Since `l[1]` is the second element of the list `l`, and assuming `l[1]` is an integer index (let's say it is `n`), then `q` becomes `l[n - 1]`, which is the same as `l[0]` if `n` is 1. However, without the exact value of `l[1]`, we express it generally as `l[0]`. The values of `i` and `p` remain unchanged.
