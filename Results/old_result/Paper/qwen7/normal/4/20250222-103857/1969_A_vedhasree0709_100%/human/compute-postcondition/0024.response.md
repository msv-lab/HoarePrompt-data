The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i <= n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`.

Given that `i` is currently 2, `n` must be greater than 3 (since `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 3.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[1]`, `q` is `l[0]`, `q` is equal to `l[p - 1]`**
