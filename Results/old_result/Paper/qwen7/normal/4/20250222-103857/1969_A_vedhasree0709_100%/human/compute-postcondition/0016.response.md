To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i <= n - 1`.
2. **Current State**: 
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `p` is `l[0]`.
   - `q` is `l[p - 1]`.
   - If `q` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1; otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, `l`, `j`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i <= n - 1` must be true. Given that `i` is currently 1, the loop will execute again if `n - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure it is greater than 1.

**State:**
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `j` is 1.
- `p` is `l[0]`.
- `q` is `l[p - 1]`.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[0]`, `q` is `l[p - 1]`**
