Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[1]`, `q` is `l[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `p = l[i]` updates the value of `p` to be the element at index `i` in the list `l`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `p` becomes `l[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
