Output State: **`i` is 3, `p` is `l[2]`, `q` is `l[l[0] - 1] - 1`, `j` is either 1 or 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 2, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 3. The values of `p`, `q`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
