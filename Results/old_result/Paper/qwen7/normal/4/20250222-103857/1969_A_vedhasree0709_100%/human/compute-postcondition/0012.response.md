Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[0]`, `q` is `l[p - 1]`, and the current value of `q` is equal to `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `l`, `j`, `p`, and `q`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional statement. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and the condition that `q` is equal to `i + 1` also remains valid.
