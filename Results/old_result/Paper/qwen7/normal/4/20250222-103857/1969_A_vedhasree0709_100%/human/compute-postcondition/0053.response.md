Output State: **`i` is 1, `p` is `l[0]`, `q` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 0, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 1. The values of `p` and `q` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code. `p` is still `l[0]`, and `q` is still `i + 1`, which now evaluates to 2.
