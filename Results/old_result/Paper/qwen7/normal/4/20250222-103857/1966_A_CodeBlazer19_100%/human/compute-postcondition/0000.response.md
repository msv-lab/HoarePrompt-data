Output State: **t is an input integer, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100; the list of integers c contains n integers such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100 for each c_i in c.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`, after executing the code, `t` is now explicitly an input integer. The conditions for `n` and `k`, and the list `c` remain unchanged and are still valid as per the initial state.
