Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer converted to an integer, `k` is an input integer converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l`, and `l` is updated to a list of integers from the input split, `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
