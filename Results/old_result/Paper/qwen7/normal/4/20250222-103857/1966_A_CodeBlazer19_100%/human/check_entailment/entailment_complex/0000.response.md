Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of cards remaining after performing the specified operations any number of times.
2. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, followed by the list of card numbers `c`.
3. It then calculates the count of each unique card number using `p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]`.
4. The logic checks if the maximum count of any unique card number (`max(p)`) is greater than or equal to `k`. If true, it prints `k - 1` because we can reduce the maximum count by `k - 1` through the operations. If false, it prints `n` because no reduction can be achieved.
5. The provided explanation matches the logic of the code and aligns with the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the annotated program accurately implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
