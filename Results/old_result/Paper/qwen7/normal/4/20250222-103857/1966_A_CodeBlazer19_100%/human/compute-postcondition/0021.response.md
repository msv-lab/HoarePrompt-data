Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer converted to an integer, `k` is an input integer converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l`, and `l` is updated to a list of integers from the input split, `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l`**.

Explanation: The code `p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]` creates a list `p` where each element is the count of occurrences of the corresponding unique element in the list `l`. Since `l` is already a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, the code does not change the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, or `l`. It only updates `p` to contain the counts of each unique element in `l`.
