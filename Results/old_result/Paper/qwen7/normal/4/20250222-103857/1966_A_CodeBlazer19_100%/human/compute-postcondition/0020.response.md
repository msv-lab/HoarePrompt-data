Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer converted to an integer, `k` is an input integer converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l`, and `l` is updated to a list of integers from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `l`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `p`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
