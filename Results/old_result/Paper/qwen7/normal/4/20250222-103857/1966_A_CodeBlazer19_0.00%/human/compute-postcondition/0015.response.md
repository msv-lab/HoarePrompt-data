Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to `t-1`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` will be an integer ranging from 0 to `t-1`. After the loop completes, `n` and `k` will have the values from the last input split by space, and `l` will be the list of integers obtained from splitting the last input string and converting each element to an integer. All other variables outside the loop remain unchanged.

In summary, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer, `k` is the last input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the last input string split by spaces and converted to integers.
