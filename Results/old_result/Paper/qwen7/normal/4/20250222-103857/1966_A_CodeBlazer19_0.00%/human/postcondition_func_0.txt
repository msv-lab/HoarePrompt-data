The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), followed by pairs of integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100), and then a list of n integers. It prints the value k - 1 for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ends with t set to the last value of t read, i set to t-1, n and k set to the values of the last test case, and l set to the list of integers from the last test case.
