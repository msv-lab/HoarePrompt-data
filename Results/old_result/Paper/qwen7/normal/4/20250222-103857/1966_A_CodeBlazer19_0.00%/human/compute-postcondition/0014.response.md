Output State: The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 3 (since the loop runs for `t` times, and `i` starts from 0), and no new assignments or changes are made to `n`, `k`, or `l` after the loop completes. Therefore, `n` and `k` retain their last assigned values from the third iteration, and `l` remains as the list of integers obtained from the third input split by spaces.

In summary, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will still be within the range of 1 to 500, `i` will be 3, and `n`, `k`, and `l` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop.
