Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer (not directly involved in the loop head).
   - `k` is an input integer (not directly involved in the loop head).
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer (not directly involved in the loop head).

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < t`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Calculate the new state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - Since `i` is now 2, `t` must still be within its original range (1 to 500) for the loop to continue.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
   - `l` remains unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**
