Postcondition: **`x` is an integer (next element from `c`), `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `no` is True.**

Explanation: If `x` is not found in either list `a` or `b`, the condition in the if statement is satisfied, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, setting `no` to True. Since there is no else part, the postcondition only considers the case where `x` is not in `a` or `b`, leading to `no` being set to True.
