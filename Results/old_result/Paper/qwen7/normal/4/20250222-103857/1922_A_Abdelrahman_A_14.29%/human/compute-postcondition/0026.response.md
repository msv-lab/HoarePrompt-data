Output State: **`c` is a non-empty string, `x` is the next character in the string `c`, `no` is `False`**

Explanation: The line `no = False` does not affect the values of `c` or `x`. It only changes the value of `no` from its previous state to `False`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
