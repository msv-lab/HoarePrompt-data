Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tests` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(tests):
    slength = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    c = input()
    no = True
    if c == a or c == b:
        no = False
        print('NO')
    else:
        for x in c:
            if x not in a and x not in b:
                print('YES')
                no = False
                break
    if no:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `no` is False, `tests` must be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 0, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is the value entered by the user, `c` is the value entered by the user, and the variable `x` is the last character in the string `c` that was checked, which means `x` is neither in `a` nor in `b`. The if condition is true because `no` is True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `no` remains False if there exists at least one character in `c` that is not in `a` and not in `b`. Otherwise, `no` remains True and `c` is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `no` is False, `c` is an input string, `i` is `tests`, `b` is an input string, and `x` is the last character from the string `c` that was not found in either list `a` or `b`. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the variable `i` remains as `tests`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
