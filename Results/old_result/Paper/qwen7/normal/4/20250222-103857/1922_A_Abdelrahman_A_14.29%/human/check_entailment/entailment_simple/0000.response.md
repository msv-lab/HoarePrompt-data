Reasoning:
- The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads the length `n`, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- It then checks if `c` is identical to either `a` or `b`. If it is, it prints "NO" immediately because `c` would match the same template as `a` or `b`.
- If `c` is not identical to `a` or `b`, it iterates through each character in `c` and checks if the character is present in both `a` and `b`. If any character in `c` is not found in both `a` and `b`, it prints "YES" and sets `no` to `False` to avoid further checks.
- If no such character is found, it prints "NO".
- The logic ensures that the program only prints "YES" if there exists a template where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not, which aligns with the problem statement.

Given this analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
