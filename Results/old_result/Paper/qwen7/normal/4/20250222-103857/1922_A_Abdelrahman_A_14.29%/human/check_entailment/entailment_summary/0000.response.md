Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but has a few issues in its logic:

1. **Initial Check for Exact Matches**: The program correctly identifies if `c` is exactly the same as `a` or `b`, in which case it prints 'NO'.
2. **Check for Characters Not in `a` or `b`**: The program incorrectly assumes that if `c` contains any character not present in either `a` or `b`, it should print 'YES'. This logic is flawed because the problem requires a template where both `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. The current implementation would incorrectly print 'YES' if `c` contains characters not in `a` or `b`, even if `a` and `b` do not match this template.
3. **Final 'NO' Print**: The program prints 'NO' for all remaining test cases after the loop, which is unnecessary and incorrect since the output should depend on the specific conditions of each test case.

To fix these issues, the program needs to:
- Check if `a` and `b` match the same template.
- Ensure that `c` does not match this template.
- Only print 'YES' if both conditions are met.

Given these points, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
