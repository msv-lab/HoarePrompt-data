Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `x` and `c`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `c`.
   - The variable `x` takes on the value of the next character in `c` during each iteration.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `c` is a non-empty string.
   - `x` is the next character in the string `c`.
   - `no` is `False`.
   - The loop continues as long as `x` is a valid character in `c`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is the next character in `c`, it means we have already processed one character from `c`.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `x` will be the next character in `c`.
   - The string `c` remains the same unless modified within the loop body, but since no modification is mentioned, `c` stays the same.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The variable `x` will be the next character in `c`.
   - The variable `no` remains `False` unless set to `True` within the loop body, but since no such action is mentioned, `no` stays `False`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`c` is a non-empty string, `x` is the next character in the string `c`, `no` is `False`**.
