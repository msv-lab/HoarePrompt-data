Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a list of integers where each test case consists of three integers n, f, and k such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, followed by a list of n integers a_i where 1 <= a_i <= 100. For each test case, if the conditions are met, it returns a specific value or performs a specific action based on the given integers and list.**
