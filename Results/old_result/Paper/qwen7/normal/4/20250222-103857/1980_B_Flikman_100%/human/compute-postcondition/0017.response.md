Output State: **`removed_count` is 3, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 1, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f - 1` in the list `a`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers which is a sorted version of `a` in descending order, and `i` is incremented by 1 such that the element at index `i + 1` in `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value`**.

Explanation: The variable `removed_count` was initially set to 2. After executing `removed_count += 1`, `removed_count` is incremented by 1, making its new value 3. All other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by the given code snippet.
