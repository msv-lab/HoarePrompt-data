Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 1, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in `a`. The variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `f`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
