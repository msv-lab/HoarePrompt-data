Postcondition: **`favorite_count` is either 0 or equal to the number of times `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value` for `i` in the range of `k`, `removed_count` is either 0 or equal to the number of times `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value` for `i` in the range of `k`. In both cases, these counts retain their values from the initial state or as described in the postconditions after 3 iterations. If `removed_count` equals `favorite_count`, the function continues with these counts unchanged. If `removed_count` does not equal `favorite_count`, the function also continues with these counts unchanged.**
