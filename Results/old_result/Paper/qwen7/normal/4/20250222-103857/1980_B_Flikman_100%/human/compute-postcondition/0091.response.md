Output State: **The value of `i` is `k`, `removed_count` is either 0 or equal to the number of times `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value` for `i` in the range of `k`, and all other variables (`k`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `favorite_value`, `sorted_a`, `t`) retain their values from the initial state or as described in the postconditions after 3 iterations.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the value of `k`. The variable `removed_count` will be incremented each time an element in `sorted_a` at index `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`) matches the `favorite_value`. Therefore, `removed_count` will be the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`. All other variables will keep their values from the initial state or as specified in the postconditions after 3 iterations.
