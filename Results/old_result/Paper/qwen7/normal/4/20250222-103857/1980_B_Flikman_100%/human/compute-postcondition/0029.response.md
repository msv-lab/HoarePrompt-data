Based on the initial state provided:

- `removed_count` is `0`.
- `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 1000`.
- `_` is `1`.
- `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.
- `favorite_value` is the element at index `f - 1` in the list `a`.
- `sorted_a` is a list of integers which is a sorted version of `a` in descending order.
- `favorite_count` is the count of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`.
- `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`.

The print statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NO'`. Since no other variables or conditions affect this print statement, the output will be exactly as written.

Output: **NO**
