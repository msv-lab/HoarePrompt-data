Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is 2 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` and `x` are assigned the values from the input split into integers.**

Explanation: The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `a` and `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
