Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes variables to track the minimum (`ax`) and maximum (`bx`) values for constraints of type 1 and 2, respectively.
2. It uses a set (`cx`) to store values of `x` for constraints of type 3.
3. The logic checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it means there's no overlap between the ranges, and thus no valid `k` exists, resulting in appending 0 to the result list.
4. If `bx` is not greater than `ax`, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of values in `cx` that lie within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total number of integers in that range (`ax - bx + 1`).
5. The final result is printed correctly.

Given the execution summary and the provided example, the program appears to handle all constraints and produce the correct results as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
