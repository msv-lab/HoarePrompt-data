Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the constraints when there are multiple `not equal to` constraints (type 3). Specifically, the program calculates the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the count of values in `cx` that fall within this range. However, this approach fails to account for the fact that the values in `cx` might overlap with the range `[bx, ax]` in such a way that they should not be subtracted.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```
- The first constraint (`1 3`) means `k >= 3`.
- The second constraint (`2 10`) means `k <= 10`.
- The third constraint (`3 1`) means `k != 1`.
- The fourth constraint (`3 5`) means `k != 5`.

The correct range for `k` is `[3, 10]`, but we need to exclude `1` and `5`. The program will calculate the range `[3, 10]` and subtract the count of `1` and `5`, which is incorrect because `1` and `5` are already excluded by the range calculation.

The program should instead directly count the valid integers in the range `[bx, ax]` and subtract the count of values in `cx` that fall outside this range. This would ensure that the program correctly handles overlapping constraints.
