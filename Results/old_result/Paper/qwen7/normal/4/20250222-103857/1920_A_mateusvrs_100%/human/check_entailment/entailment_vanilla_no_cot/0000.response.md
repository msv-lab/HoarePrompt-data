Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Constraints**: For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and then iterates through each constraint to update the relevant variables (`ax`, `bx`, and `cx`).
   - `ax` is updated to the minimum value from constraints of type 2.
   - `bx` is updated to the maximum value from constraints of type 1.
   - `cx` is a set that stores values from constraints of type 3.
3. **Checking Feasibility**: After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it means there are no feasible values for `k`, and it appends `0` to the result list.
4. **Counting Valid Values**: If `bx` is not greater than `ax`, it calculates the number of valid values for `k` by subtracting the count of invalid values (stored in `cx`) from the total range `[bx, ax]`.
5. **Outputting Results**: Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

Given the constraints and the guarantees provided in the problem statement, this implementation should correctly handle all valid inputs and produce the expected outputs.
