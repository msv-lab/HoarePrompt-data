Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `ax` is updated to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`. Since `x` and `ax` are both input integers, `ax` will take the smaller of the two values. All other variables remain unchanged.
