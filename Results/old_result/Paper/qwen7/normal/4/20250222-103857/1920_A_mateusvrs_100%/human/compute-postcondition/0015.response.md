Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer not equal to 2, `x` is an input integer**.

The code adds the input integer `x` to the set `cx`. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer not equal to 2, and `x` is an input integer is still valid.
