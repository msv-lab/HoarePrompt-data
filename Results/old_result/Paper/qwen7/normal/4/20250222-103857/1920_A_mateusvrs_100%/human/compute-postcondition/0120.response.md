Output State: **`t` is 1, `r` is [0, 0], `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000000, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values provided as inputs, `a` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, `x` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)` assigns the value `1000000007` to the variable `ax`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
