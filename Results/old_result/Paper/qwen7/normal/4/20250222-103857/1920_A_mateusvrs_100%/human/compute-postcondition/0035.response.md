Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be 0, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values that were added during the loop's iterations, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 1, and `a` and `x` are the last input integer values provided before the loop terminates.

This final state indicates that after all iterations of the loop have completed, `n` will be 0 because all iterations have been exhausted. The set `cx` contains every unique `x` value that was added to it during the loop. The variable `ax` holds the smallest `x` value among those where `a` was 2. The variable `bx` holds the largest `x` value among those where `a` was 1. The values of `a` and `x` from the last input before the loop ends are stored for reference.
