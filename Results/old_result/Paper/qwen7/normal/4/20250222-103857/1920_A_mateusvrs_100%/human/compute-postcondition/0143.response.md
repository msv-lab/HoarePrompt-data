Output State: **`t` is 1, `r` is [0, 0], `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is 1000000000, `bx` is -1, `a` is the first input integer value, `x` is the second input integer value, `n` is the original value of `n` minus 1.**

Explanation: The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `cx` was initially either an empty set or a set containing `x`, after adding `x` again (if it wasn't already there), `cx` will now be a set containing `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
