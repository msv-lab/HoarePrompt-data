Output State: **`t` is 1, `r` is [0, 0], `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values provided as inputs, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values provided as inputs, `a` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, `x` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `cx = set()` creates an empty set and assigns it to the variable `cx`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
