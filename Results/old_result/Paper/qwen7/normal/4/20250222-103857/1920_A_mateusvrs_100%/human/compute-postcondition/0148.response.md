Output State: **`t` is 1, `r` is [0, 0], `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000000, `bx` is -1, `a` is the first input integer value, `x` is the second input integer value, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.**

The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `a` and `x` respectively. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
