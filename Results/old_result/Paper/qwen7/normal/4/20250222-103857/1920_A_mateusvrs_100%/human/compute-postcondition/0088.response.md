Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `x` is an integer equal to the second input number, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `a`.**

Explanation: The line `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `a`. Since `a` and `x` are initially defined as the first and second input numbers respectively, `ax` will take the smaller value between `a` and `x`.
