Output State: **`i` is 7, `bx` is 3, `ax` is 8, `tmp` is 5, `r` is a list containing the value 2**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to the list `r`. Given the values `ax` is 8, `bx` is 3, and `tmp` is 5, the calculation is `8 - 3 + 1 - 5`, which equals 1. So, `r` now contains the value 1. All other variables retain their original values.
