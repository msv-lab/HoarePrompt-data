Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007.**

The code assigns the value of `1000000000.0 + 7` to `ax` after converting it to an integer. Since `1000000000.0 + 7` equals `1000000007.0`, and then it is converted to an integer, `ax` becomes `1000000007`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
