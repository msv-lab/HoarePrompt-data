Output State: **`i` is 1; `pattern` is a list containing 'AB'**

Explanation: The code snippet `pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])` checks the value of `i % 2 ^ 1`. Given that `i` is 1, `i % 2` equals 1 (since 1 modulo 2 is 1), and `1 ^ 1` equals 0 (since XOR of 1 with itself is 0). So, `'AB'[0]` is 'A', which is already in the list `pattern`. Therefore, the list `pattern` remains unchanged.
