Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `range(n // 2)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 because `range(n // 2)` generates a sequence starting from 0 up to `n // 2 - 1`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n // 2`. Therefore, the loop will execute at least once if `n // 2` is greater than 0.

4. **Check the given state information**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (not directly relevant to the loop execution).
   - `n` is an input integer and `n` is even.
   - `pattern` is an empty list (not directly relevant to the loop execution).

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, we need to ensure that `i` is 0.
   - We need to ensure that `n // 2` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given that `n` is even, `n // 2` will be a positive integer. Therefore, the loop will always execute at least once if `n > 0`.

So, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0 (since `n` is even, this ensures `n // 2` is greater than 0).

The final state is:
**`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**.

Thus, the answer is:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
