Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an input integer, and `n` must be greater than 12. The variable `pattern` will be a string consisting of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters with a length of `n // 2`.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` will have been decremented by at least 3 (since it must have executed at least 3 times), so `t > 2`. Additionally, `n` must be greater than 12 because each iteration of the loop effectively halves `n` (rounding down) until it reaches a value greater than 12. The final value of `pattern` will be a string of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, with a length of `n // 2`.
