Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n // 2)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `i` is 2
   - `pattern` has elements `['B', 'AB']`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n // 2`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - For the loop to execute, `n // 2` must still be greater than `i`. Therefore, `n // 2` must be greater than 3.

5. **Formulate the new state**: The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 6** (since `n // 2 > 3` implies `n > 6`).

Note that the `pattern` list remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
