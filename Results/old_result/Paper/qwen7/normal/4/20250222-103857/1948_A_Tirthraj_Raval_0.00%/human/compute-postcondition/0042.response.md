Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 1 (though its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement).
- `n` is an input integer (its value is not specified and does not affect the print statement).
- `pattern` is a list of 9 alternating 'A' and 'B' characters. Since it alternates starting from the first character, the pattern would be: ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A'].
- `i` is 4.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Output: **YES**
