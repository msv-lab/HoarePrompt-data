Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.

2. **Checking for Validity:**
   - It checks if `n` is odd.
     - If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because an odd number of special characters cannot be achieved with the given rules.
     - If `n` is even, it proceeds to generate a string.

3. **Generating the String:**
   - It initializes an empty list `pattern`.
   - It generates a pattern using 'A' and 'B' such that each pair of adjacent characters is different.
   - Specifically, it alternates between 'A' and 'B' for the first half of the pattern and repeats this for the second half.
   - Finally, it joins the list into a string and prints it.

4. **Special Character Check:**
   - Each character in the generated string will have exactly one neighbor that is different from it.
   - This ensures that every character in the string is special.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1 (`n = 6`):**
  - The program will generate a string like "ABABAB" or "BAABBA".
  - In both cases, each character has exactly one different neighbor, making all characters special.
  - The output will be:
    ```
    YES
    ABABAB
    ```

- **Test Case 2 (`n = 1`):**
  - Since `n` is odd, the program will print 'NO'.
  - Output:
    ```
    NO
    ```

- **Test Case 3 (`n = 2`):**
  - The program will generate a string like "AB" or "BA".
  - Both strings have exactly one special character.
  - The output will be:
    ```
    YES
    AB
    ```

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all cases where `n` is even by generating a suitable string and correctly reports when `n` is odd. The generated strings meet the criteria of having exactly one special character per position.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
