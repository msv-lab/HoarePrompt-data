### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- The task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters.
- A character is considered special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- The program should handle multiple test cases, each with a different `n`.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func()` processes a series of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.
- If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'.
- If `n` is even, it prints 'YES' and generates a string of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters of length `n/2`, then prints this string.
- The function does not return any value after processing all test cases.

#### Program Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))
```

1. **Odd `n` Case**: 
   - When `n` is odd, the program correctly prints 'NO', which is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Even `n` Case**:
   - When `n` is even, the program generates a string of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters of length `n/2`.
   - For example, if `n = 6`, the pattern generated is `ABABAB`, which has 4 special characters (at positions 2, 3, 4, and 5).
   - However, the problem requires exactly `n` special characters. For `n = 6`, we need 6 special characters, not 4.

#### Verification Using Function Summaries:
- The function summary states that the program generates a string of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters of length `n/2`. This does not guarantee that the generated string will have exactly `n` special characters.
- The example provided (`AAABAACC`) has 6 special characters, but the program does not generate such a pattern.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the requirement of generating a string with exactly `n` special characters. The function summary and the example in the problem description suggest that a more complex pattern generation is needed, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not generate a string with exactly `n` special characters as required by the problem description.
