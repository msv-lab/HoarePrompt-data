Based on the initial state provided:
- `i` is 3
- `v2` is 3
- `v1` is 2

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

This statement will print a formatted string with the values of `v1` and `v2` inserted into the placeholders. Specifically:
- `{v1}` will be replaced by the value of `v1`, which is 2.
- `{v2}` will be replaced by the value of `v2`, which is 3.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 2 2 3 3**
