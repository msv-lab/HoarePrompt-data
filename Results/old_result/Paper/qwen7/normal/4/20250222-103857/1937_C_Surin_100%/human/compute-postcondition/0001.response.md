Output State: **A lambda function `R` is defined which takes no input but reads a line of space-separated integers from input and returns them as a list of integers.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line of space-separated integers from input and returns them as a list of integers. This function replaces the initial state where `I` was defined to read a line of space-separated integers and return them as a list of integers. Since the lambda function `R` serves the same purpose, the output state remains the same as the initial state, just with `R` instead of `I`.
