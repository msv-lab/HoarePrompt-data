Based on the initial state provided:

- `prev` is `n-1`
- `i` is `3`
- `n` must be greater than `3`
- `v2` is `3`
- `v1` is `2`
- `g` is `0`
- `r` is an input string

The print statement is:

```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Here, `v1` is explicitly given as `2`, and `v2` is explicitly given as `3`. Therefore, the placeholders `{v1}` and `{v2}` in the formatted string will be replaced with their respective values.

So, the print statement will output:

Output: **? 2 2 3 3**
