Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `v2` is defined as `n-1`. Since `n` is not explicitly given, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know it is `n-1`.
- `v1` is also defined as `n-1`, so it has the same value as `v2`.
- `prev` is either 0 or 1, but its exact value is not specified.
- `r` is an input string from the user, but its value is not specified.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

Given the values:
- `{i}` will be replaced with the value of `i`, which is 3.
- `{prev}` will be replaced with the value of `prev`, which is either 0 or 1.

Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `prev`. If `prev` is 0, the output will be `? 3 3 0 0`. If `prev` is 1, the output will be `? 3 3 1 1`.

Since `prev` can be either 0 or 1, the output could be either of these two strings.

Output: **? 3 3 0 0 or ? 3 3 1 1**
