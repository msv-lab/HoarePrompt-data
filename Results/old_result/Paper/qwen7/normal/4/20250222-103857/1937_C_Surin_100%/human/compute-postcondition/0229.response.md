Output State: **`i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is either 0 or 1, the system output buffer is flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. However, it does not change the values of the variables `i`, `v2`, `v1`, `prev`, or the fact that `r` is an input string from the user. Therefore, these variables and their states remain unchanged.
