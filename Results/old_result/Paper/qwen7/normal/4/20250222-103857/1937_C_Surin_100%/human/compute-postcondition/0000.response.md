Output State: **A lambda function `I` is defined which takes no input but reads a line of space-separated integers from input and returns them as a list of integers. No variables are initialized with specific values.**

This lambda function `I` allows the program to read multiple integers from the input in one go and return them as a list. However, no variables are explicitly initialized or modified within this code snippet. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the definition of the lambda function `I`.
