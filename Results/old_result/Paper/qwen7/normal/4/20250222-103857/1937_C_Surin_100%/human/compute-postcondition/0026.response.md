Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3
- `n` must be greater than 2 (though `n` is not used in the print statement)
- `v2` is 3

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

From the initial state, we know the value of `v2` is 3, but there is no information about `v1`. Since `v1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, the placeholders `{v1}` will remain as they are in the output string.

Output: **'? {v1} {v1} 3 3'**
