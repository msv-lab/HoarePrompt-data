Output State: **`prev` is `n-1`, `i` is `3`, `n` must be greater than `3`, `v2` is `3`, `v1` is `2`, `g` is `0`, `r` is an input string**

The code `r = input('')` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `r`. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than `3` is still valid.
