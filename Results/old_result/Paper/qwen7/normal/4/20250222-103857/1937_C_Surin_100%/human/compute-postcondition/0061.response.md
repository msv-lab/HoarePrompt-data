Based on the initial state provided:

- `prev` is `n-1`
- `i` is `1`
- `n` must be at least 2
- `v2` is `n-1` (though `v2` is not used in the print statement)
- `r` is the new input string from the user (but it is not used in the print statement)

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

Given the values:
- `i` is `1`
- `prev` is `n-1`

Since `n` must be at least 2, let's denote `n` as some integer greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, `prev` is `n-1`.

So, the print statement will output:
```
? 1 1 n-1 n-1
```

Output: **? 1 1 n-1 n-1**
