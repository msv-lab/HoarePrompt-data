Output State: **`i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is either 0 or 1, `r2` is '<', the system output buffer is flushed.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change the values of any variables. It only flushes the output buffer, meaning any buffered data in the standard output stream is written out immediately. Therefore, the values of `i`, `v2`, `v1`, `prev`, and `r2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
