Functionality: **The function interacts with an external entity to perform queries and determines the maximum XOR value of any two indices in a hidden permutation. It handles up to 3n queries, where n is the size of the permutation (ranging from 2 to 10^4). After completing all iterations, it outputs the maximum XOR value found.**
