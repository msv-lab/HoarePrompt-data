Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range definition involving `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - The loop iterates over `range(1, n)`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop starts with `i = n-1` and decrements `i` until it reaches 1 (inclusive).

4. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be in the range `1` to `n-1` inclusive.
   - Given `i = n-1`, the loop will start when `n > 1`. However, since `n` must be greater than 3 (as given in the initial state), this condition is already satisfied.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is set to `n-1` and the loop starts from `1` to `n-1`, `i` will decrement through all values from `n-1` down to `1`.
   - The value of `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute properly.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` must be greater than 3**
