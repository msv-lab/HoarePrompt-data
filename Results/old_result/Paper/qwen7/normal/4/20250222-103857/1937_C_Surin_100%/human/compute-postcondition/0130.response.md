Based on the initial state provided:

- `r` is an input string and it is not equal to '>'.
- The current value of `r` is '='.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

Here, `i` and `prev` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since they are not provided, we cannot determine their exact values. However, we can still describe the structure of the output.

Given the context, let's assume `i` and `prev` are placeholders for values that would be determined elsewhere in the code. The output will be a formatted string with these placeholders.

Output: **'? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]'**
