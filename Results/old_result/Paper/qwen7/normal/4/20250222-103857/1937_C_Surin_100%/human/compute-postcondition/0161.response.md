Output State: **`r` is an input string, `prev` is `i`, `i` is `i+1`, `n` is greater than `i+1` if `prev` is `i`, `r2` is an input string**.

Explanation: The code `prev = i` updates the value of `prev` to be equal to the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `n` being greater than `i+1` if `prev` is `i+1` is no longer relevant since `prev` is now `i`.
