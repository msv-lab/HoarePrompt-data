Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `n`.
   - `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n` is the upper limit of the range.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `v2` is 1 (this variable is not part of the loop head).
   - `r` is either unchanged or equal to '<' (this variable is not part of the loop head).

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the condition `i < n` will be true as long as `n` is greater than 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged and still must be greater than 1.
   - `v2` and `r` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `v2` is 1, and the current value of `r` is either unchanged or equal to '<'.**
