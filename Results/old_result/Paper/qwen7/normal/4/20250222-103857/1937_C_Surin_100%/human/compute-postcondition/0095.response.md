Output State: **`prev` is `n-1`, `i` is `1`, `n` must be greater than `1`, `v2` is `1`, `v1` is `0`, `g` is `0`**

Explanation: The code `v2 = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is `1`) to `v2`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `prev` is still `n-1`, `i` is still `1`, `n` must still be greater than `1`, `v2` is now `1`, `v1` is still `0`, and `g` is still `0`.
