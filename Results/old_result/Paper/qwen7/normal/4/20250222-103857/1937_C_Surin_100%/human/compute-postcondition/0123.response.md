To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given print statement:

```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

From the initial state, we need to identify the values of `v1`, `i`, and `prev`.

- `v1`: There is no explicit value given for `v1`, so we'll leave it as `v1`.
- `i`: There is no explicit value given for `i`, so we'll leave it as `i`.
- `prev`: There is no explicit value given for `prev`, so we'll leave it as `prev`.

Given these values, the print statement will output a formatted string with placeholders for `v1`, `i`, and `prev`.

Output: **'? v1 i v1 prev'**
