Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `kp in range(int(input()))`. This means that the loop will iterate based on the value returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `kp` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`. Therefore, the loop will run for each integer from 0 up to (but not including) the value of `int(input())`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `kp`**: At the start of the loop, `kp` will be 0 because the `range` function starts counting from 0.

4. **Determine the Input for `int(input())`**: Since the `lambda` function `R` reads a line of space-separated integers and returns them as a list, the input for `int(input())` should be a single integer that determines the number of iterations for the loop.

5. **Adjust the States**: Based on the above points, the initial state of `kp` is 0, and the input for `int(input())` must be a positive integer to ensure the loop executes at least once.

Given these points, we can formulate the required state adjustments:

- `kp` is initially 0.
- The input for `int(input())` must be a positive integer to ensure the loop executes.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: `kp` is 0, the input for `int(input())` must be a positive integer**
