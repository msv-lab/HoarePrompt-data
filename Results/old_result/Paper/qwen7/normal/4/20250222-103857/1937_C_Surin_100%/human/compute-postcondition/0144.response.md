Output State: **`r` is an input string, if `r` equals '>', then `prev` is an input integer, if `r` equals '=', then `r2` is the input string from the user, and if `r2` equals '<', then `prev` is set to `i+1`, `i` is `i+1`, `n` must be greater than `i+1`, and `r` is now the new input string**.

Explanation: The code `r = input()` takes an input string and assigns it to the variable `r`. Depending on the value of `r`, the conditions specified in the initial state will be checked. However, since the value of `r` is only updated here, the output state reflects that `r` is now the new input string, while the other conditions remain as they were described in the initial state.
