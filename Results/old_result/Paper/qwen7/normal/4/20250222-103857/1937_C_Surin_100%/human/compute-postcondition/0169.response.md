Output State: **`r` is an input string, `prev` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `g` is 0.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or states. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console immediately. Since no variables are affected by this operation, the initial state remains unchanged.
