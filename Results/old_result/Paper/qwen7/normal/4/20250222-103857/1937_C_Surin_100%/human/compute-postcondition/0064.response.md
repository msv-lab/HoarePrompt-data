Output State: **`prev` is `1`, `i` is `1`, `n` must be at least 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r2` is an input string from the user**

Explanation: The code `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 1) to `prev`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `n` must be at least 2 is still valid.
