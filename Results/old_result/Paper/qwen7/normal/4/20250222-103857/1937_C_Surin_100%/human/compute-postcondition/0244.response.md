Output State: **`i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is either 0 or 1, `r` is an input string from the user.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or affect the initial state of the variables. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console immediately. Since no variables are modified or new values are assigned, the values of all variables remain unchanged.
