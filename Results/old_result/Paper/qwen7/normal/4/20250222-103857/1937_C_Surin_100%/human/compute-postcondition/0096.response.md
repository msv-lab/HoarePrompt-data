Based on the initial state provided:

- `prev` is `n-1`
- `i` is `1`
- `n` must be greater than `1`
- `v2` is `1`
- `v1` is `0`
- `g` is `0`

The `print` statement is:

```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Here, the placeholders `{v1}` and `{v2}` will be replaced by their respective values. From the initial state, we know that `v1` is `0` and `v2` is `1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
