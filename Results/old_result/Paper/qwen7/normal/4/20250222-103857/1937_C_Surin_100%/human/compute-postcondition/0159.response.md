Output State: **`r` is an input string, `prev` is either `i` or `i+1`, `i` is `i+1`, and `n` is greater than `i+1` if `prev` is `i+1`.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables. It flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any previously printed data is actually displayed. Since no variables are modified, the values of `r`, `prev`, `i`, and the condition for `n` remain unchanged.
