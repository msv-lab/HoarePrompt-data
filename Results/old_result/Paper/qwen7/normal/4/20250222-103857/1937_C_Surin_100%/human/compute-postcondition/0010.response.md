Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `v2` is 1**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not modify any variables. It flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which means it ensures that all pending output is written to the terminal or file. Since no variables are affected, the values of `i`, `n`, and `v2` remain unchanged.
