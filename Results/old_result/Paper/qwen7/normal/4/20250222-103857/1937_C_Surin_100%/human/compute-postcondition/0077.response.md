Output State: **`prev` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `v2` is 1, `r` is the string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or conditions. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console immediately. Since no variables are modified, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
