State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0** 

### Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`.
- `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
- For the loop to execute, `x` must be greater than 0 because the `range(x)` function generates numbers from 0 to `x-1`. If `x` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
- The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop condition and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `x` (must be greater than 0) and the initial value of `i` (which is set to 0).
