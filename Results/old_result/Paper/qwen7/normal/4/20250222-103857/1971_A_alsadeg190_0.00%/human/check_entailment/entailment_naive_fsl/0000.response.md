Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. According to the problem description, the input starts with an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of integers. However, the provided program reads a single integer `x` and then processes each pair of integers within the loop, which is incorrect. It should read `t` pairs of integers directly without reading an extra integer `x`.

A corrected version would look like this:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(y, x)
        else:
            print(x, y)

func()
```

This corrected version properly handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.
