Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, x is an input integer**.

The code `x = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `x`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds an integer value between 1 and 100 inclusive.
