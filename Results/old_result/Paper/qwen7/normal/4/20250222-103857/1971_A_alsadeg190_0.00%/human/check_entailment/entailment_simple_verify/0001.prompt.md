You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3

- Program: 
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 99 (since the loop runs from `range(x)`, and `x` is an input integer which can be at most 100, so the maximum value of `i` would be 99), `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer. After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains unchanged within its initial bounds, `i` will be set to 99 (the maximum possible value since the loop runs `x` times and `x` can be at most 100), and `x` and `y` will retain their last input values from the loop's final iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `x`, which represents the number of test cases.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: It then runs a loop `x` times to process each test case.
3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y`.
4. **Comparing and Printing**: It compares `x` and `y` and prints them in ascending order (i.e., the smaller number first, followed by the larger number).

Let's analyze the logic:
- If `x > y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
- If `y > x`, it prints `y` followed by `x`.

This logic correctly outputs the minimum value first and the maximum value second for each pair of integers.

### Example Analysis:
- For the input `1 9`, the output should be `1 9` because 1 is the minimum and 9 is the maximum.
- For the input `8 4`, the output should be `4 8` because 4 is the minimum and 8 is the maximum.
- For the input `1 4`, the output should be `1 4` because 1 is the minimum and 4 is the maximum.
- And so on...

The program correctly handles all the examples provided in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the required functionality.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
