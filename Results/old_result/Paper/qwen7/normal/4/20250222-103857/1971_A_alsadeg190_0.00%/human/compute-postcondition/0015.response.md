Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < x`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\)
   - `i` is 1
   - `x` is an input integer
   - `y` is an input integer
4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` starts from 1 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, after the first iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - `x` remains unchanged as the loop body does not modify it.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i`.

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**
