The function processes an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9. Depending on whether `x` is greater than `y`, it prints either `(x, y)` or `(y, x)`. After processing all test cases, it does not return any value but prints the results of each test case.
