Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is equal to the value of `x` (which is the number of times the loop has executed), `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer. After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be equal to the value of `x`, which is the total number of times the loop has run. The values of `t` and `x` and `y` remain unchanged from their initial or most recent input values, as they are not modified within the loop.
