Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. Specifically, it reads `x` at the beginning but should be reading pairs of integers `(x, y)` for each test case. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        if x > y:
            print(y, x)
        else:
            print(x, y)

func()
```

This corrected version reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the pair of integers `(x, y)`, and prints the minimum followed by the maximum as required.
