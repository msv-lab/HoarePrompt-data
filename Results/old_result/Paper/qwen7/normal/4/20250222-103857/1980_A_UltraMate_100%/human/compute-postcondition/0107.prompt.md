Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    ans = 0
    p = 'ABCDEFG'
    hmp = Counter(s)
    for i in p:
        if i not in hmp:
            ans += m
    for i in hmp:
        if hmp[i] < m:
            ans += m - hmp[i]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `hmp` contains all keys that were initially present, and for each key `i` in `hmp`, `hmp[i]` will be at least `m`. If `hmp[i]` was initially less than `m`, it will be incremented by `m - hmp[i]`. The variable `ans` will be the sum of all increments made during the loop iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The value of `ans` is the sum of `2*m` and the increments made during each iteration where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be 'A', since it iterates through the keys of the dictionary `hmp` which are the characters in 'ABCDEFG'. `ans` will be increased by `m - hmp[i]` for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that is not found in `hmp`. If a character from 'ABCDEFG' is not in `hmp`, `ans` will be increased by `m`. If all characters in 'ABCDEFG' are found in `hmp` with their frequencies being greater than or equal to `m`, then `ans` will remain unchanged.

This means that `i` will end up as 'A' because the loop processes each character in the order they appear in 'ABCDEFG', and `ans` will be adjusted based on the comparison between `m` and the frequency of each character in the dictionary `hmp`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
