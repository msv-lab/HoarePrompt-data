State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `_` is not relevant as it is a throwaway variable**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, it does not need to be adjusted.
- The variable `t` is set to an integer value via `int(input())`, and for the loop to execute, `t` must be a valid integer within the specified range (1 to 1000 inclusive).

Thus, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
