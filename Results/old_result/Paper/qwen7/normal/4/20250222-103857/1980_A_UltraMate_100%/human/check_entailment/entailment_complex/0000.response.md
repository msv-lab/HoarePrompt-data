Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the string `a` which represents the difficulties of the problems.
3. It initializes a counter `hmp` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `a`.
4. It iterates over the difficulty levels 'ABCDEFG' and checks if each level is present in `hmp`.
   - If a level is not present, it adds `m` to `ans` because Vlad needs to create `m` problems of that difficulty.
   - If a level is present but the count is less than `m`, it adds `m - hmp[i]` to `ans` to account for the shortfall.
5. Finally, it prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps described, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that each of the seven difficulty levels appears at least `m` times across all rounds.

Correctness: **True**
