Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `ans` is the sum of `2*m` and the increments made during each iteration where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `t` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `n` and `m`. It does not affect the value of `ans` or `t` directly, but it changes their initial state. The value of `ans` remains as the sum of `2*m` and the increments made during each iteration where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, and `t` is decreased by 1.
