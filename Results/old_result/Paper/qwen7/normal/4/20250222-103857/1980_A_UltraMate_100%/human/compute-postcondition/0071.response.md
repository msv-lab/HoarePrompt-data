Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `t` (the number of iterations) and the loop counter `_`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - The value of `ans` is the sum of `2*m` and the increments made during each iteration where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - For each iteration, if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, some increment is added to `ans`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop counter `_` is an underscore (`_`), it is typically used as a throwaway variable and does not affect the state directly.
   - The only relevant variable in the loop head is `t`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - If the loop is about to start its next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 because one iteration has already completed.
   - The value of `ans` remains the same since the loop body is omitted and no changes are mentioned for `ans` outside the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `t` is reduced by 1.
- `ans` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`ans` is the sum of `2*m` and the increments made during each iteration where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `t` is decreased by 1**.

State: **`ans` is the sum of `2*m` and the increments made during each iteration where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `t` is decreased by 1**
