Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in p:`. Here, `i` is the variable that iterates over the characters in the string `p`, and `p` is the sequence being iterated over.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `p`**: 
   - `p` is given as `'ABCDEFG'`, which means `i` will iterate over the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.
   - The variable `i` will take the value of each character in `p` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are characters left to iterate over in `p`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `p` is fixed and known (`'ABCDEFG'`), no adjustment is needed for `p`.
   - The variable `i` will start with the first character of `p` (which is 'A') in the first iteration.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `i` to reflect the first character of `p`.

**State:**
**`i` is 'A', `p` is 'ABCDEFG'**
