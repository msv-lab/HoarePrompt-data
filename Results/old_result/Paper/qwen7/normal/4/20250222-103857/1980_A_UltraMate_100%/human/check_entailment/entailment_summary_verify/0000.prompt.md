You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 1
    
    BGECDCBDED
    
    10 2
    
    BGECDCBDED
    
    9 1
    
    BBCDEFFGG

Output

    2
    5
    1

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEFG'
        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\), and a string \(a\) of length \(n\) containing characters from 'A' to 'G'. It calculates and prints the total number of additional occurrences needed for each character in 'ABCDEFG' to reach at least \(m\) occurrences across all strings in the test cases. Specifically, for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that is not present in any string, it adds \(m\) to the count. For characters present but with fewer than \(m\) occurrences, it adds the difference \(m - \text{occurrences}\). The final output is the sum of these adjustments for all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to come up with. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the required number of problems for a given difficulty level exceeds the total number of rounds `m`.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
10 1
BGECDCBDED
10 2
BGECDCBDED
9 1
BBCDEFFGG
```

The expected output is:

```
2
5
1
```

However, the program's output for the second test case (where `n = 10`, `m = 2`, and the string is `BGECDCBDED`) is incorrect. The program calculates the number of additional problems needed as follows:

- For 'A': 2 (since `m = 2` and 'A' is not present in the string).
- For 'B': 1 (since 'B' appears once and `m = 2`).
- For 'C': 0 (since 'C' appears twice and `m = 2`).
- For 'D': 0 (since 'D' appears twice and `m = 2`).
- For 'E': 0 (since 'E' appears once and `m = 2`).
- For 'F': 0 (since 'F' appears three times and `m = 2`).
- For 'G': 0 (since 'G' appears twice and `m = 2`).

The program sums these values to get `2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3`, which is incorrect. The correct calculation should be:

- For 'A': 2 (since `m = 2` and 'A' is not present in the string).
- For 'B': 1 (since 'B' appears once and `m = 2`).
- For 'C': 0 (since 'C' appears twice and `m = 2`).
- For 'D': 0 (since 'D' appears twice and `m = 2`).
- For 'E': 0 (since 'E' appears once and `m = 2`).
- For 'F': 0 (since 'F' appears three times and `m = 2`).
- For 'G': 0 (since 'G' appears twice and `m = 2`).

Thus, the correct answer should be `2`, but the program outputs `3`.

This discrepancy shows that the program does not correctly handle the requirement that the total number of problems needed for each difficulty level should not exceed `m`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
