Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in p`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `p`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is in the sequence defined by `p`. 

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is an integer.
   - `hmp` is a dictionary.
   - `ans` is increased by `m` again.
   - If `i` is not in `hmp`, then `ans` remains `ans + m`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `p`, the next value of `i` will be the next element in the sequence `p`.
   - The variable `hmp` and `ans` will remain the same unless the loop body changes them, but since no specific loop body is provided, we assume they stay the same.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be the next element in `p`.
   - `hmp` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` remains unchanged.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is the next element in `p`, `hmp` is a dictionary, `ans` is increased by `m` again**.
