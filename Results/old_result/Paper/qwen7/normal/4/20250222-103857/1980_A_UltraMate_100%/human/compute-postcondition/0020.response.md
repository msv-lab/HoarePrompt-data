Output State: **All characters in string `s` have been checked against the counter `hmp`. For each character in the string `p` ('ABCDEFG'), if the character is not found in `hmp`, the variable `ans` has been incremented by `m`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, every character in the string `p` will have been checked against the counter `hmp`. If a character is not present in `hmp`, the value of `ans` will be increased by `m`. Since the loop iterates over all characters in `p`, `ans` will be incremented by `m` for each character in `p` that does not appear in `s`.
