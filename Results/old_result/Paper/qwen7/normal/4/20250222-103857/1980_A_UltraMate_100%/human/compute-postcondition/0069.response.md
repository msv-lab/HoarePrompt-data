Output State: **The value of `ans` is the sum of `2*m` and the increments made during each iteration where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**

Explanation: Initially, `ans` is set to `2*m`. The loop iterates over all characters in `p` ('ABCDEFG'), and for each character `i` that is a key in `hmp` and has a value less than `m`, `ans` is incremented by `m - hmp[i]`. After all iterations, `ans` will be the initial value plus the sum of all increments made during the loop.
