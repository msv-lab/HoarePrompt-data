Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the dictionary `hmp`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over all keys in `hmp`. After each iteration, `i` is set to the next key in `hmp`.

3. **Determine the postconditions**:
   - `hmp` must have at least one key.
   - `i` is the next key in `hmp`.
   - If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.
   - If `hmp[i]` is not less than `m`, no change is made to `ans` and `i` remains the next key in `hmp`.

4. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `hmp` must have at least one key.
   - `i` is the next key in `hmp`.
   - If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.
   - If `hmp[i]` is not less than `m`, no change is made to `ans` and `i` remains the next key in `hmp`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is about to execute again, `i` will be set to the next key in `hmp`.
   - `hmp` must still have at least one key (since the loop continues as long as there are keys left).

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` will be set to the next key in `hmp`.
- `hmp` must still have at least one key.

Since the exact value of `hmp[i]` and `ans` is not specified in the postcondition for the previous iteration, we cannot make specific adjustments to these variables. We only need to ensure that `i` is set to the next key and `hmp` still has at least one key.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: **`hmp` must have at least one key, `i` is the next key in `hmp`**.
