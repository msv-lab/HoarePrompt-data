Output State: **`i` is the next key in `hmp`, `ans` is updated by adding `m - hmp[i]` to its current value.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the value of `m - hmp[i]` to its current value. The variable `i` remains unchanged as it was the next key in `hmp` before the operation. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `ans` and the unchanged value of `i`.
