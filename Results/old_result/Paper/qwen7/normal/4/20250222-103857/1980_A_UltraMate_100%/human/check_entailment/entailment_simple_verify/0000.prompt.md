You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5, and a is a string of n characters where each character is one of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', or 'G'.

        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `i` will be 'A', as the loop processes each character in the order they appear in 'ABCDEFG'. The variable `ans` will be the sum of all increments made during the loop iterations. Specifically, for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that is not found in `hmp`, `ans` will be increased by `m`. If a character from 'ABCDEFG' is found in `hmp` but its frequency is less than `m`, `ans` will be increased by `m - hmp[i]`. If all characters in 'ABCDEFG' are found in `hmp` with their frequencies being greater than or equal to `m`, then `ans` will remain unchanged.
    #
    #In summary, `i` will be 'A', and `ans` will be the total adjustment made to it based on the conditions described above.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to come up with. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the required number of problems for a given difficulty level exceeds the total number of rounds `m`.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
10 1
BGECDCBDED
10 2
BGECDCBDED
9 1
BBCDEFFGG
```

The expected output is:

```
2
5
1
```

However, the program's output for the second test case (where `n = 10`, `m = 2`, and the string is `BGECDCBDED`) is incorrect. The program calculates the number of additional problems needed as follows:

- For 'A': 2 (since `m = 2` and 'A' is not present in the string).
- For 'B': 1 (since 'B' appears once and `m = 2`).
- For 'C': 0 (since 'C' appears twice and `m = 2`).
- For 'D': 0 (since 'D' appears twice and `m = 2`).
- For 'E': 0 (since 'E' appears once and `m = 2`).
- For 'F': 0 (since 'F' appears three times and `m = 2`).
- For 'G': 0 (since 'G' appears twice and `m = 2`).

The program sums these values to get `2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3`, which is incorrect. The correct calculation should be:

- For 'A': 2 (since `m = 2` and 'A' is not present in the string).
- For 'B': 1 (since 'B' appears once and `m = 2`).
- For 'C': 0 (since 'C' appears twice and `m = 2`).
- For 'D': 0 (since 'D' appears twice and `m = 2`).
- For 'E': 0 (since 'E' appears once and `m = 2`).
- For 'F': 0 (since 'F' appears three times and `m = 2`).
- For 'G': 0 (since 'G' appears twice and `m = 2`).

Thus, the correct answer should be `2`, but the program outputs `3`.

This discrepancy shows that the program does not correctly handle the requirement that the total number of problems needed for each difficulty level should not exceed `m`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
