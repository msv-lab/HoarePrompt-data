Postcondition: ***`container` is `container + water - target`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `target` is `total_water // n`, `water` is the second element of `a`. If `container < 0`, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, no specific change is made to the variables.***
