Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to equalize the amount of water in all containers by pouring water from one container to another, where the initial total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers.
2. The annotated program correctly follows the logic required:
   - It reads the input and processes it into a list of integers.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with the appropriate arguments.
   - The function `func_1` checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If not, it immediately returns 'No'.
   - It then calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).
   - It iterates through the list of water amounts, adjusting a `container` variable that keeps track of the deviation from the target amount. If at any point the `container` becomes negative, it means it's impossible to equalize the water amounts, and the function returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without the `container` becoming negative, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that it is possible to equalize the water amounts.

Given the logic and the steps described, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
