The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers of length `n` such that the sum of all elements in `a` is divisible by `n`. It calculates the target amount of water each element in `a` should have by dividing the total sum of `a` by `n`. Then, it iterates through the list `a`, adjusting a `container` variable which tracks the difference between the current sum and `n` times the target. If at any point the `container` becomes negative, the function returns 'No'. If the loop completes without the `container` becoming negative, the function returns 'Yes'.
