Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

# Annotated Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
print(func_1(n, a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and a is a list of non-negative integers of length n such that the sum of all elements in a is divisible by n.
def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if (total_water % n != 0) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State: `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `n` is a positive integer, and `a` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` such that the sum of all elements in `a` is divisible by `n`, and `total_water % n == 0`
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
        
    #State: Output State: `container` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `n` times `target`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `target` is `total_water // n`.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the `container` variable will hold the value of the total water (sum of all elements in `a`) minus `n` times the target value (`total_water // n`). The `total_water` remains unchanged as it is the sum of all elements in `a`, and `n` and `target` also remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers of length `n` such that the sum of all elements in `a` is divisible by `n`. It calculates the target amount of water each element in `a` should have by dividing the total sum of `a` by `n`. Then, it iterates through the list `a`, adjusting a `container` variable which tracks the difference between the current sum and `n` times the target. If at any point the `container` becomes negative, the function returns 'No'. If the loop completes without the `container` becoming negative, the function returns 'Yes'.
