Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `b` is the first integer entered, `c` is the second integer entered.**

Explanation: The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them by whitespace, and assigns them to `b` and `c` respectively. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1 (though the increment is not explicitly shown, it is implied by the context). Since `i` was initially 0, after this line, `i` is now 1. However, since the task specifies to only update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code, and to include all the information of the precondition that is still valid, the output state includes `t`, `a`, `i`, `b`, and `c`.
