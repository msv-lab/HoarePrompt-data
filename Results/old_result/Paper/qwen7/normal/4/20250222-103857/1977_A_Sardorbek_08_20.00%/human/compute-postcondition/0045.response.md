Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `a`, `b` is an integer obtained from the last input split, `c` is an integer obtained from the second last input split, `q` is a tuple containing (`b`, `c`). The values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, and `q` remain unchanged regardless of the conditions within the loop.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `a` because the loop runs `a` times. The values of `b` and `c` will be the last integers read from the input during the last iteration of the loop. The variable `q` will contain the tuple of these last `b` and `c` values. All other variables (`t` and `a`) remain unchanged as they were initialized before the loop and are not modified within the loop.
