Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `c` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`. The value of `q` remains unchanged regardless of whether `a % 2` equals `b % 2`.**
