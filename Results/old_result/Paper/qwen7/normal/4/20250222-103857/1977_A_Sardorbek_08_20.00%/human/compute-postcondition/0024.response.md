Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `b` is an integer.
   - `c` is an integer.
   - `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs as long as `i < a`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.
   - The value of `a` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same as it was at the start of the loop.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `a` remains unchanged.

6. **Consider the postconditions involving `b` and `c`**:
   - These conditions do not affect the loop continuation logic directly but are part of the loop body. They do not need to be adjusted here.

Given the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `a`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.**
