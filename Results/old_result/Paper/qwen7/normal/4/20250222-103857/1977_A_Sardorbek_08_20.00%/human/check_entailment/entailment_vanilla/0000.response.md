Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `a` times to process each test case.
   
2. **Test Case Processing:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - The values are stored in a tuple `q`, but this tuple is not used later in the code.
   - The program checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.

3. **Conditions Checked:**
   - **Condition 1:** `b == c`
     - If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, it prints 'YES'. This condition is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, it means each move added one cube.
   - **Condition 2:** `b < c`
     - If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, it prints 'NO'. This condition is correct because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves if each move adds exactly one cube.
   - **Condition 3:** `a % 2 == b % 2`
     - This condition checks if the number of moves `b` is even or odd and compares it with the number of test cases `a`. This condition is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if it's possible to achieve the desired number of cubes. Instead, it should check if the difference between `b` and `c` is even (since each move changes the count by 1, the difference must be even).

4. **Expected Correct Conditions:**
   - To correctly determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves, we need to check if the absolute difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is because each move changes the count by 1, so the parity (even or odd nature) of the difference between `n` and `m` must be even.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if abs(b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect due to the incorrect condition checks. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
