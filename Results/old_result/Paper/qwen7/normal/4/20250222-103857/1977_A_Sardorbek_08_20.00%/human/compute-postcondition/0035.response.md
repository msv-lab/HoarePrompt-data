Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\)
   - `a` is an input integer
   - `i` is 1
   - `b` is an integer obtained from the first input split
   - `c` is an integer obtained from the second input split
   - `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`, and its value remains unchanged regardless of whether `b` is equal to `c`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < a`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The value of `a` remains unchanged.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `a` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is incremented to 2.
   - `b` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `c` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `q` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `c` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`**.
