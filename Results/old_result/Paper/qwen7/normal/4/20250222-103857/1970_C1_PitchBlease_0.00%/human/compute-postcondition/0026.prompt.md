Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `queue` is a deque containing the tuple (`start`, 0) removed, `current` is `start`, `dist` is 0, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing the element `start`. The current node is not equal to the target node.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `current` is `start`, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start` and `neighbor`, and `queue` is a list containing a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `current` is the first neighbor of `start` in the adjacency list of `tree[start]`, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start`, `current`, and `queue` is a list containing a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` where `neighbor` is the current neighbor of `start` and `dist` is the distance from `start` to this neighbor, if `neighbor` is not already in `visited`. If `neighbor` is already in `visited`, the `visited` set and `queue` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `current` is either `neighbor` or remains unchanged, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start`, `current`, and `neighbor` if `neighbor` is not already in `visited`, `queue` is a list containing tuples `(neighbor, dist + 1)` appended with `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` is not already in `visited`, and remains unchanged if `neighbor` is already in `visited`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
