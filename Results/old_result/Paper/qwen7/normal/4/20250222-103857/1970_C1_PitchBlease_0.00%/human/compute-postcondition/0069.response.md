Output State: **`current` is the first element of `queue`, `dist` is the second element of `queue` plus 1, `queue` is the remaining elements of `queue` after removing the first element, `tree` must have at least one neighbor for `current`, `neighbor` is added to `visited`.**

Explanation: The code adds the `neighbor` to the set `visited`. The values of `current`, `dist`, `queue`, and `tree` remain unchanged from their initial states.
