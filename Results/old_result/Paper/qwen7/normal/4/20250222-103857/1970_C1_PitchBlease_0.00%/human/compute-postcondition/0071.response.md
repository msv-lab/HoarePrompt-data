Postcondition: `current` is the first element of `queue`, `dist` is the second element of `queue` plus 1, `queue` is the remaining elements of `queue` after removing the first element, `tree` must have at least one neighbor for `current`, and if `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `neighbor` is added to `visited`, and `(neighbor, dist + 1)` is appended to `queue`.
