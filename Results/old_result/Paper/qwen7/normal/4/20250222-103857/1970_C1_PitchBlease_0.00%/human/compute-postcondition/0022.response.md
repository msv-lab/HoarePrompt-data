Output State: **`current` is `neighbor`, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start`, `current`, and `neighbor`, `queue` is a list containing tuples `(neighbor, dist + 1)` where `neighbor` is the current neighbor of `start` and `dist` is the distance from `start` to this neighbor, if `neighbor` is not already in `visited`. If `neighbor` is already in `visited`, the `visited` set and `queue` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `visited.add(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` to the `visited` set. Since `current` was previously `next_neighbor`, it now becomes `neighbor`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
