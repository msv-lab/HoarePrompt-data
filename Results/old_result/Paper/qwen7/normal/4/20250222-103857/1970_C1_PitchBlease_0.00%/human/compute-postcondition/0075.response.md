Output State: The `current` node will be the target node, `dist` will hold the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `target` node, `queue` will be empty, and `visited` will contain all nodes that have been visited during the traversal. The `tree` structure remains unchanged, and the algorithm has successfully found the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `current` node will be the `target` node, `dist` will represent the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `target` node, `queue` will be empty because there are no more nodes to process, `visited` will include all nodes that were part of the shortest path search, and the `tree` structure will remain the same as it was initially.
