Output State: **`dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`, `current` is the current node being processed, `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor that is not in `visited`, `visited` now includes the `neighbor` that was just processed, and `queue` now contains a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` where `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor of `current`, and `queue` also contains the new tuple `(new_neighbor, dist + 1)` where `new_neighbor` is another unvisited neighbor of `current`.**

In this output state, the `queue` has been updated to include the new tuple `(new_neighbor, dist + 1)`, where `new_neighbor` is another unvisited neighbor of the current node `current`. All other variables remain in their previous states.
