Output State: **The program returns -1, indicating that the target node was not found during the traversal. The current node is undefined, dist is undefined, queue is empty, visited contains all nodes that were checked, and the tree structure remains unchanged.**

This means that after the loop terminated, the algorithm did not find the target node from the start node, hence returning -1 to indicate failure. The current node and dist are not specified as they were not updated to a valid target node and its distance. The queue is empty as there are no more nodes to process. The visited set includes all nodes that were checked during the traversal, and the tree structure remains the same as when the loop started.
