Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing a tuple (`start`, 0), `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing the element `start`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a set called `visited` and adds the starting node (`start`) to it. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.
