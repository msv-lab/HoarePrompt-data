Output State: **`current` is `start`, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start`, `neighbor`, and `queue` is a list containing a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. This means that the current `current` and `start` remain unchanged, `target` remains unchanged, and `visited` also remains unchanged. The `queue` now contains the new tuple, where the first element is `neighbor` and the second element is `dist + 1`.
