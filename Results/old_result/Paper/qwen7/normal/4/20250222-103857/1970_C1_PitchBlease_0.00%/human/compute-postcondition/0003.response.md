Output State: **`queue` is now a deque containing the tuple (`start`, 0) removed, `current` is `start`, `dist` is 0, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing the element `start`.**

Explanation: The code `current, dist = queue.popleft()` removes the first element from the deque `queue` and assigns it to `current` and `dist` respectively. Initially, `queue` contains the tuple (`start`, 0). After removing this tuple, `queue` no longer contains it, `current` is set to `start`, and `dist` is set to 0. The values of `start`, `target`, and `visited` remain unchanged.
