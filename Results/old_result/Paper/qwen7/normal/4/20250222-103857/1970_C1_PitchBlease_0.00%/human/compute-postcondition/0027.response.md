The loop condition is based on the `queue` variable. For the loop to execute one more time, the `queue` must not be empty. At the end of the previous iteration, the `queue` contains tuples of unvisited neighbors of the current node along with their distances from the start node. To ensure the loop can execute again, the `queue` must still contain at least one tuple.

Therefore, we need to ensure that the `queue` is not empty. No other states need to be adjusted since the loop's continuation solely depends on the `queue`.

State: **`current` is the node that is closest to the `target` node among all nodes that have been visited, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited during the traversal, and `queue` is not empty**
