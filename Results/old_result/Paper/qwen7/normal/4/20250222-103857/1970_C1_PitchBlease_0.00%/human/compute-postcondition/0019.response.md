Postcondition: `current` is the first neighbor of `start` in the adjacency list of `tree[start]`, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start`, `current`, and `queue` is a list containing a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` where `neighbor` is the current neighbor of `start` and `dist` is the distance from `start` to this neighbor, if `neighbor` is not already in `visited`. If `neighbor` is already in `visited`, the `visited` set and `queue` remain unchanged.
