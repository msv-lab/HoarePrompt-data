Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and the precondition that `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000` still holds.**

This means that the variable `t` now holds the integer value entered by the user, which must be within the range of 1 to 5000 (inclusive), and all other preconditions and variables remain unchanged.
