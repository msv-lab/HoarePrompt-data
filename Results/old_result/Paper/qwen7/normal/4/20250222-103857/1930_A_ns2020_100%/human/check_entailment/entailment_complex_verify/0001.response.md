### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the score by choosing pairs of integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that we add \(\min(x, y)\) to our score.
   - We must do this exactly \(n\) times, where \(2n\) integers are initially present on the board.
   - To achieve the maximum score, we should always choose the smallest available integers to minimize the loss in score when erasing them.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of integers `A`.
   - It sorts the list `A` in ascending order.
   - It then prints the sum of every other element starting from the first element (`A[::2]`), which effectively sums up the smallest half of the elements.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - By sorting the array and summing every other element starting from the first, we ensure that we are always adding the smaller of the paired elements.
   - This strategy guarantees that we are maximizing the score because we are always choosing the smallest available integers to pair together.
   - However, the key point here is that the problem requires us to choose pairs of integers exactly \(n\) times, and the sum of every other element starting from the first does not necessarily represent the optimal way to pair the integers.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For the first test case: `2 3`. Sorting gives `[2, 3]`. Sum of every other element starting from the first is `2`.
     - Optimal pairs: `(2, 3)`, score = `2`.
   - For the second test case: `1 1 2 1`. Sorting gives `[1, 1, 1, 2]`. Sum of every other element starting from the first is `1 + 1 = 2`.
     - Optimal pairs: `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, score = `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - For the third test case: `1 1 1 1 1 1`. Sorting gives `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. Sum of every other element starting from the first is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.
     - Optimal pairs: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 1)`, and `(1, 1)`, score = `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

While the provided solution works for the given examples, it does not guarantee the optimal solution in all cases. The optimal strategy involves always choosing the smallest available integers to pair together, but the current implementation does not explicitly form pairs and thus may not always yield the highest score.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not always guarantee the maximum score because it does not explicitly form pairs and instead sums every other element starting from the first. This approach might not always result in the optimal solution.

### Final:
Final: **False**
