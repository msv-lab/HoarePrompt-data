Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value between 0 and 4999 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers**.

Explanation: The code `A.sort()` sorts the list `A` in ascending order. However, since `A` was already mentioned to be a sorted list, sorting it again does not change its state. The values of `t`, `n`, and `A` remain unchanged from their initial states.
