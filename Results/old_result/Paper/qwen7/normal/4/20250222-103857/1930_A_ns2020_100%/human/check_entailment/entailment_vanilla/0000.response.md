### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the score by choosing pairs of integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that we add \(\min(x, y)\) to our score.
   - We must do this exactly \(n\) times, where \(2n\) integers are initially present on the board.
   - To achieve the maximum score, we should always choose the smallest available integers to minimize the loss in score when erasing them.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of integers `A`.
   - It sorts the list `A` in ascending order.
   - It then prints the sum of every other element starting from the first element (`A[::2]`), which effectively sums up the smallest half of the elements.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - By sorting the array and summing every other element starting from the first, we ensure that we are always adding the smaller of the paired elements.
   - This strategy guarantees that we are maximizing the score because we are always choosing the smallest available integers to pair together.
   - For example, if the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the sum of every other element starting from the first is \(1 + 3 = 4\). This is equivalent to pairing `(1, 2)` and `(3, 4)` and adding the minimums, resulting in a score of \(1 + 3 = 4\).

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For the first test case: `2 3`. Sorting gives `[2, 3]`. Sum of every other element starting from the first is `2`.
   - For the second test case: `1 1 2 1`. Sorting gives `[1, 1, 1, 2]`. Sum of every other element starting from the first is `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - For the third test case: `1 1 1 1 1 1`. Sorting gives `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. Sum of every other element starting from the first is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

Since the solution correctly implements the optimal strategy for maximizing the score, the given program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
