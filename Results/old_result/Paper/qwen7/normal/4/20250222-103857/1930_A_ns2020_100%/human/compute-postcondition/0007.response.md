The loop condition is `t`, which is a value between 0 and 4999 (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be non-zero. Since `t` was non-zero at the end of the previous iteration, it means `t` was greater than 0.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `t` must be adjusted to a non-zero value. Given that `t` was non-zero at the end of the previous iteration, the simplest adjustment is to keep `t` as it is, but we need to ensure it remains non-zero.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is non-zero.

State: **`t` is a non-zero value between 0 and 4999 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer**
