Given the initial state:
- `t` is a value between 1 and 5000 (inclusive).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input `n` and converting each element to an integer.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(sum(A[::2]))
```

Let's break down the components:

1. **`A`**: This is a sorted list of integers derived from the input `n`. Since `n` is an integer, it will be split into individual digits, converted to integers, and then placed in a list. For example, if `n = 12345`, then `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

2. **`A[::2]`**: This slice notation means every second element starting from the first element of the list `A`. So, for the example `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `A[::2]` would be `[1, 3, 5]`.

3. **`sum(A[::2])`**: This calculates the sum of the elements in the list `A[::2]`. In our example, `sum([1, 3, 5]) = 9`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the sum of every second element in the sorted list `A`.

Output: **sum of every second element in the sorted list A**
