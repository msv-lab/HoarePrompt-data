You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        A.sort()
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        t = t - 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        A.sort()
        
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        
        t = t - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be reduced to 0 because the loop condition `while t:` checks if `t` is non-zero. Once `t` reaches 0, the loop terminates. The values of `n` and `A` will be as they were set in the last iteration of the loop, since these variables are defined inside the loop and are not affected by the loop's termination condition.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` indicating the number of cases, then an integer `n`, and a sequence of `2n` integers. It sorts the sequence of integers and calculates the sum of every second element starting from the first element. Finally, it prints this sum for each test case and reduces `t` until it reaches zero.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by always selecting the smallest two numbers available on the whiteboard. By sorting the list and summing every second element (i.e., `A[::2]`), the program ensures that the minimum of the pairs is always added to the score. This approach guarantees the maximum possible score because it minimizes the loss at each step.

Given the problem constraints and the examples provided, the program handles all potential cases correctly. Sorting the list and summing every second element ensures that the score is maximized regardless of the order of the input numbers. Therefore, the program is correct.
