Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value between -1 and 4998 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input taken from the user to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t` and `A`) remain unchanged. The output state includes the updated value of `n` and retains the initial conditions for `t` and `A`.
