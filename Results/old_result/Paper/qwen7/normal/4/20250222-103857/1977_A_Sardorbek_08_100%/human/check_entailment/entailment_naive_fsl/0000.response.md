Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program checks if `b` (the number of moves) is equal to `c` (the desired number of cubes), or if `b` is less than `c`, or if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd). However, it fails to consider the possibility that the number of moves `b` can be greater than `c` and still result in a tower with exactly `c` cubes.

For example, in the third test case (5 3), the program incorrectly prints "Yes" because it checks if `b % 2 == c % 2` and prints "Yes" without considering that `b` can be greater than `c`. A correct approach would involve checking if the absolute difference between `b` and `c` is even, as each move changes the number of cubes by 1 (either adding or removing one cube).

A corrected version of the program could look like this:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if abs(b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

This corrected version checks if the absolute difference between `b` and `c` is even, which ensures that the number of moves can result in a tower with exactly `c` cubes.
