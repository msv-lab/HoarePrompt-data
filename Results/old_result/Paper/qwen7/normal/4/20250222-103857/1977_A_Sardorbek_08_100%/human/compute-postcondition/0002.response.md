Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `b` is the first integer entered, `c` is the second integer entered.**

Explanation: The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `b` and `c` respectively. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged, and `i` remains 0.
