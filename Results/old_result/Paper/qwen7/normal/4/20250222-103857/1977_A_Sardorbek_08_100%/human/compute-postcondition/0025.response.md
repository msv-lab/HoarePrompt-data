Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`. If `b` is equal to `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`. Otherwise, either `b` is less than `c` and `b` is not equal to `c`, or `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd).
