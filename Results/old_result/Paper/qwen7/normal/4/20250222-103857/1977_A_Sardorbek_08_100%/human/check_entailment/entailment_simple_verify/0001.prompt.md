You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `a`, `b` is an integer from the input split, `c` is an integer from the input split, and `q` is a tuple containing (`b`, `c`). Regardless of the values of `b` and `c`, the value of `q` remains unchanged throughout the loop's execution.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function `func()` reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `a` times to process each test case.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to have `c` cubes after `b` moves.

3. **Conditions Checked:**
   - If `b` equals `c`, it prints 'YES' because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, it means he just added all the cubes without removing any.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO' because you cannot add more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it prints 'Yes'. This condition seems to be checking if the difference between `b` and `c` is even, which is necessary but not sufficient.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Correctness Check

To determine if the program is correct, let's consider the logic:

- **Case 1:** `b == c`
  - If the number of moves equals the number of cubes, it's trivially possible to have `c` cubes after `b` moves by adding all cubes.
  - Correctly handled by printing 'YES'.

- **Case 2:** `b < c`
  - It's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
  - Correctly handled by printing 'NO'.

- **Case 3:** `b % 2 == c % 2`
  - This condition checks if the number of additions and removals results in the same parity for the final count of cubes. However, this alone is not sufficient.
  - For example, if `b = 3` and `c = 2`, `b % 2 == c % 2` holds true (both are odd), but it's impossible to have 2 cubes after 3 moves since you can only add or remove one cube at a time.
  - This condition should be combined with another check to ensure the exact number of moves can result in the desired number of cubes.

### Example Test Cases

- **Test Case 1:** `3 3`
  - `b = 3`, `c = 3`
  - `3 % 2 == 3 % 2` is true, and `b == c`, so the output is 'YES'.
  - Correct.

- **Test Case 2:** `2 4`
  - `b = 2`, `c = 4`
  - `2 < 4`, so the output is 'NO'.
  - Correct.

- **Test Case 3:** `5 3`
  - `b = 5`, `c = 3`
  - `5 % 2 == 3 % 2` is false, so the output is 'NO'.
  - Correct.

### Conclusion

The program does handle the basic conditions correctly, but the condition `b % 2 == c % 2` is insufficient on its own. It needs to be combined with ensuring the exact number of moves can result in the desired number of cubes. However, the provided solution does not fully address this requirement.

### Final Answer

Given the analysis, the program does not fully meet the requirements as stated. Therefore:

Correctness: **False**
