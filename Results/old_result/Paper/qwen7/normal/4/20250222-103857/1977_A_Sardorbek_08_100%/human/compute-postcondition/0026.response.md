Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `a`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i < a`.
3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `b` is an integer.
   - `c` is an integer.
   - `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.
   - The value of `a` remains unchanged.

5. **Maintain Other States**: The other variables (`t`, `b`, `c`, and `q`) remain the same as they are not part of the loop head.

Given this reasoning, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.**
