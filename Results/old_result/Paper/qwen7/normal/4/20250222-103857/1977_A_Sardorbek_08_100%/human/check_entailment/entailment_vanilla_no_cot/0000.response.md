Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all edge cases. Specifically:

1. **Case where `b` (number of moves) is greater than `c` (desired number of cubes):**
   - If `b > c`, it should still be possible to achieve `c` cubes if the difference between `b` and `c` is even because each move can add or remove exactly one cube.
   
2. **Case where `b` is odd and `c` is even, or vice versa:**
   - The current logic checks if `b % 2 == c % 2`, which is not sufficient. Instead, we need to check if the absolute difference between `b` and `c` is even.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if abs(b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

```

This version correctly handles all the edge cases and ensures the program works as expected.
