Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer from the input split, `c` is an integer from the input split, `q` is a tuple containing (`b`, `c`). The value of `q` remains unchanged regardless of whether `b % 2` equals `c % 2` or not.**
