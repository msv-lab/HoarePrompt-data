State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `i` must be 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
2. The loop runs for `a` iterations.
3. For the loop to execute, `a` must be at least 1 (since `range(a)` includes 0 up to but not including `a`).
4. The initial state of `t` (which is a positive integer between 1 and 100) does not affect whether the loop executes or not.
5. Therefore, the only variables that need adjustment are `a` and `i`. `i` must be set to 0, and `a` must be at least 1.

Thus, the final state is: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `i` must be 0**.
