You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        cnt = 0
        cur = 0
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), and \( m \), and a string \( s \). For each test case, it counts how many times a specific pattern (formed by the first \( k \) lowercase English letters) appears in the string \( s \). If the count is at least \( n \), it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it constructs and prints a string consisting of the last used letter in the pattern, followed by the remaining required letters to reach \( n \) occurrences, and fills the rest with 'a'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by a string `s`.

2. **Bitmasking Logic:**
   - It uses a bitmask (`cur`) to track which characters have been seen in the string `s`.
   - For each character in `s`, it updates the bitmask.
   - If the bitmask reaches `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been seen at least once, and it increments `cnt`.

3. **Checking Subsequences:**
   - After processing the entire string `s`, it checks if `cnt` is at least `n`.
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string `ans` that represents a missing subsequence.

4. **Constructing Missing Subsequence:**
   - It initializes `tmp` to an empty string.
   - It finds the first character that is missing in the bitmask and appends it to `tmp`.
   - It constructs `ans` by combining `tmp` with the remaining characters needed to form a string of length `n`.

### Detailed Verification:

1. **Bitmasking Logic:**
   - The bitmask logic correctly tracks the presence of characters in `s`.
   - The condition `if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` ensures that the current character is new and hasn't been seen before.

2. **Checking Subsequences:**
   - The logic to check if `cnt` is at least `n` is correct.
   - If `cnt < n`, it means not all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`.

3. **Constructing Missing Subsequence:**
   - The construction of `ans` is correct. It finds the first missing character and appends it to `tmp`.
   - It then appends the remaining characters to complete the string of length `n`.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the edge case where the string `s` might not contain all required subsequences.
- It correctly identifies and prints one such missing subsequence.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to check for all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and prints the appropriate output.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
