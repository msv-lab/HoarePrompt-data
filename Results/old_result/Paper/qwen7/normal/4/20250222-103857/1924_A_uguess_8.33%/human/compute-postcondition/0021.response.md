Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string (without its first character), `cur` is either the original value or the original value plus \(2^{cur_ss}\) depending on whether the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` is satisfied, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of the new `s` minus the integer value of 'a', and `cnt` remains unchanged if `cur` does not equal \(2^k - 1\).
