Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`, `n` is the input integer from the first input split, `k` is the input integer from the second input split, `m` is the input integer from the third input split, `cnt` is 3, `cur` is 0, a new string `s` is taken as input.**

The code `s = input()` takes a new string input and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `cnt`, and `cur`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
