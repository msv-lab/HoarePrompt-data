Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `ss in s`. This means the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a'.
   - If `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\), then `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `cur` and `cur_ss` remain unchanged.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will process the next character in the string `s`.
   - Therefore, `s` will now be the remaining part of the string after removing the first character.
   - `cur_ss` will be updated based on the new first character of the remaining string `s`.
   - `cur` and `cnt` will remain unchanged unless the condition `cur == 2^k - 1` is met for the new `cur_ss`.

Given these points, let's formulate the state for the next iteration:

- `s` becomes the string `s` without its first character.
- `cur_ss` is updated to the integer value of the first character of the new `s` minus the integer value of 'a'.
- `cur` and `cnt` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string (without its first character), `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of the new `s` minus the integer value of 'a', `cur` is unchanged, and `cnt` is unchanged if `cur` does not equal \(2^k - 1\)**.
