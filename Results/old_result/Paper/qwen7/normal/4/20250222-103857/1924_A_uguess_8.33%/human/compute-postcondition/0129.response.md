Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`, `n` is the input integer from the first input split, `k` is the input integer from the second input split, `m` is the input integer from the third input split, `cnt` is 1, `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`, `ss` is a character from the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, and `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` evaluates to `1 << cur_ss`**.

Explanation: The line `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` was 0, so now `cnt` is 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
