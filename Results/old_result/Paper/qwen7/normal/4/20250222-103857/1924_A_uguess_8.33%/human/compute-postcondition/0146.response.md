Postcondition: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`, `n` is the input integer from the first input split, `k` is the input integer from the second input split, `m` is the input integer from the third input split, `cnt` is 4, `cur` is 0, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')`**.

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` is true, then `cur` remains unchanged at 0. If the condition is false, `cur` also remains unchanged at 0. Therefore, regardless of the outcome of the if condition, the value of `cur` is 0. All other variables retain their values as described in the precondition.
