Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`, `n` is the input integer from the first input split, `k` is the input integer from the second input split, `m` is the input integer from the third input split, `cnt` is 3, `cur` is `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` updates the value of `cur` by shifting 1 to the left by `cur_ss` positions and adding it to `cur`. Here, `cur_ss` is defined as `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, which means `cur` is updated by adding \(2^{cur_ss}\) to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged.
