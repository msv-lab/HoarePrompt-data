Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 1, `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur_ss` is the same as before.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was initially 0, after executing this line, `cnt` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
