Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `i` is equal to the length of the original string `s` and `i` must be less than `k`.
- `cur` is such that when shifted left by `i` bits and bitwise ANDed with 1, the result is 0.
- `tmp` is a character which is 'a' plus `i`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i` being the length of the original string `s`.
   - The loop iterates from `0` to `k-1`.
   - After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

2. **Variable `cur`:**
   - The condition `cur & 1 << i == 0` must hold.
   - This means that the `i`-th bit of `cur` must be 0.
   - This condition does not change if the loop continues because `cur` is not modified within the loop.

3. **Variable `tmp`:**
   - `tmp` is defined as `'a' + i`.
   - This value is derived from `i` and does not change during the loop iterations.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Increment `i`:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be `length(s) + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `k`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `cur & 1 << i == 0` must hold. Since `cur` is not modified, this condition remains unchanged.

3. **Value of `tmp`:**
   - `tmp` is derived from `i`, so after the first iteration, `tmp` will be `'a' + (length(s) + 1)`.

### Final State:
- `i` will be `length(s) + 1`.
- `cur` remains unchanged and satisfies the condition `cur & 1 << i == 0`.
- `tmp` is now `'a' + (length(s) + 1)`.

### Updated State:
State: **`i` is length(s) + 1, `cur` is such that when shifted left by (length(s) + 1) bits and bitwise ANDed with 1, the result is 0, `tmp` is 'a' + (length(s) + 1)**
