Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s` + 2; `k` must be greater than the length of the input string `s`; `tmp` is 'c'**.

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` calculates the character corresponding to the ASCII value of 'a' plus the value of `i`. Since `i` is the length of the input string `s` + 2, the ASCII value of 'a' is 97, so `ord('a') + i` results in 97 + (length of `s` + 2). This value is then converted to its corresponding character using `chr()`. Given that the minimum value of `i` is 2 (if the input string `s` is empty), the character 'c' is generated. Therefore, `tmp` is set to 'c'. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
