Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is `cur + 1 << cur_ss`, `cur_ss` is the same as before.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the value of `cur` by shifting 1 to the left by `cur_ss` positions and then adding this value to `cur`. Since `cur_ss` is unchanged, `cur` now holds the value of its previous state plus \(2^{cur_ss}\). All other variables remain in their initial states except for `cur`.
