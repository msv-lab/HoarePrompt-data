Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 2, `cur` is unknown, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the character `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur_ss` is calculated.**

Explanation: The code `cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')` calculates the value of `cur_ss` by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of the character `ss`. The other variables remain unchanged.
