Postcondition: `i` is the length of the input string `s`, `k` must be greater than the length of the input string `s`, and the current value of `cur` does not have the `i`-th bit set to 1. In this case, `tmp` is set to 'a' + `i`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described above.
