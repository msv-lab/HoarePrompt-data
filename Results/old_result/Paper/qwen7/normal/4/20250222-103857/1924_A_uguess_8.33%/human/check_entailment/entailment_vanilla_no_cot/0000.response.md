Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Bitmasking Logic**: The bitmasking logic used to track the presence of characters in the string `s` is flawed. It doesn't correctly handle the requirement to check for all possible strings of length `n`.

2. **Counting Valid Subsequences**: The variable `cnt` is incremented when all bits corresponding to the current character are set in the bitmask `cur`. However, this approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` are checked.

3. **Generating the Result String**: The generation of the result string `ans` is based on the bitmask `cur`, but it does not correctly generate a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to ensure that we check all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and verify if they are subsequences of the given string `s`. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(s, sub):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(c in it for c in sub)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        
        # Generate all possible strings of length n using the first k lowercase English alphabets
        all_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]
        
        found_all = True
        for string in all_strings:
            if not is_subsequence(s, string):
                found_all = False
                break
        
        if found_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            # Print any string of length n that is not a subsequence of s
            for string in all_strings:
                if not is_subsequence(s, string):
                    print(string)
                    break

func()
```

This solution uses the `itertools.product` function to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It then checks if each generated string is a subsequence of the given string `s`. If all possible strings are found to be subsequences, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO" and one such string that is not a subsequence.
