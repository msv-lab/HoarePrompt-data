Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 3, `cur` is 0.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `cur`. Since `cur` was previously defined as `cur + 1 << cur_ss` under certain conditions, and now it is explicitly set to `0`, the new value of `cur` is `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
