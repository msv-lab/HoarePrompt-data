Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals and another extrovert. Specifically, consider the test case `1 4 1` (1 introvert, 4 extroverts, 1 universal):

- According to the problem description, the 4 extroverts need to be placed in pairs, but there is only 1 universal available. This means that 3 extroverts cannot be placed in a tent with another extrovert and a universal, leaving these 3 extroverts without a place to stay. Therefore, it is impossible to accommodate all participants under the given conditions, and the program should return `-1`.

However, the current implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` does not account for this scenario. The function `func_1` incorrectly returns a value when it should return `None` in such cases. For instance, in the test case `1 4 1`, `func_1(4, 1)` would incorrectly return a value instead of `None`, leading to an incorrect result of `3` instead of `-1`.

To fix this, the logic in `func_1` needs to check if there are enough universals to pair with all extroverts and handle the case where there are not enough universals appropriately.
