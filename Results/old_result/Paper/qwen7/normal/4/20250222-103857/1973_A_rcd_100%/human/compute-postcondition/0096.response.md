Output State: **`x` is either 2 or 3, `p1` is an integer entered by the user, `p2` is an integer entered by the user, `p3` is an integer entered by the user, `y` must be at least 0**

Explanation: The value of `x` is incremented by 1. Since `x` was either 0 or 1, it now becomes either 2 or 3. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged as they were integers entered by the user. The condition for `y` remains the same, i.e., `y` must be at least 0.
