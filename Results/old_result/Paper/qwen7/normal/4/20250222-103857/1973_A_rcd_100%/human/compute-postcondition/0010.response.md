Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `x` is 0.**

The code `x = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `x`. No other changes are made to the initial conditions or the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. Therefore, the output state retains all the initial conditions and updates only the value of `x` to 0.
