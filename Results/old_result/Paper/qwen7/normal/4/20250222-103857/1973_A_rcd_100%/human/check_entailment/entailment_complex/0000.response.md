Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input of multiple test cases, reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case individually.
2. **Sum Check**: The program correctly checks if the sum of the scores (`p1 + p2 + p3`) is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case, which is correct according to the problem statement.
3. **Condition Check**: The program correctly checks if `p3 >= p1 + p2`. If this condition is true, it prints `p1 + p2`, which is also correct because in this scenario, the maximum number of draws would be `p1 + p2` (since each draw gives 1 point to each player).
4. **Finding Maximum Draws**: For cases where `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program attempts to find integers `x` and `y` such that `p1 - x <= p2 - y` and calculates the maximum possible number of draws as `p1 - x + p3`. This logic is correct because each draw contributes 1 point to each player, and the goal is to maximize the number of draws.
5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when no valid `x` and `y` can be found, in which case it prints `p3`.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of draws for each test case, and it handles all specified conditions and constraints appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
