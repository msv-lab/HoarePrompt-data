Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `x` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user.
   - `y` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - The condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is true.

2. **Expression to Evaluate**:
   - The expression to evaluate is `p1 - x + p3`.

3. **Substitute Known Values**:
   - Since `x` is 0, the expression simplifies to `p1 + p3`.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` simplifies to `p1 <= p2 - y` because `x` is 0.
   - This means that `p1 + y <= p2`, but this condition is not directly needed to determine the output of the print statement.

5. **Final Expression**:
   - The print statement will output the value of `p1 + p3`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `p1 + p3`.

Output: **p1 + p3**
