Based on the initial state, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user. The code snippet only prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`. The value of `p3` is not used in this particular print statement.

Since the values of `p1` and `p2` are explicitly defined as integers entered by the user, we can directly use these values in the output.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are the integers entered by the user)**
