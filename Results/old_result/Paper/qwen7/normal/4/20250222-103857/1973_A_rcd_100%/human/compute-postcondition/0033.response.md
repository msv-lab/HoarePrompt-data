Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `x` is either 0 or 1, `x` is increased by 1, `y` is decreased by 1 and is now greater than or equal to 0.**

This means that `y` has been decremented by 1, making it `y - 1`. Since `y` was initially greater than or equal to 1, after decrementing, `y` is still greater than or equal to 0. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
