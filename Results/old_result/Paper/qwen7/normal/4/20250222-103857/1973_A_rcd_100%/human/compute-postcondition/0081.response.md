Output State: **`x` is 0, `p1` is an integer entered by the user, `p2` is an integer entered by the user, `p3` is an integer entered by the user.**

The code initializes `x` to 0. Since there is no further manipulation of `x`, `p1`, `p2`, or `p3` within the given snippet, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. The condition regarding the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being odd or even does not affect the variables `x`, `p1`, `p2`, or `p3` because no actions are specified for the else part when the sum is even.
