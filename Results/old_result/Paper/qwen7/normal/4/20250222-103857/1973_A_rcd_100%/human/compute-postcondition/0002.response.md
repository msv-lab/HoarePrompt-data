Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the user input and assigns them to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The initial condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are updated to the integers provided by the user.
