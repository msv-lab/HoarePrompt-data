Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, we continue the loop. If `p3` is not less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, `x` is either 0 or 1, `y` is 1 if the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is true, otherwise `y` is 0, and `t` remains greater than 1.
