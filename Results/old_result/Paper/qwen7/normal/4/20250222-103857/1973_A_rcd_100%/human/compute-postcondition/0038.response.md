Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. Variables `x` and `y` are such that `y` equals `p3` and `x` is either 0 or 1. If the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is met during the loop, the function prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks. Otherwise, the function prints `p3` after all possible iterations.
