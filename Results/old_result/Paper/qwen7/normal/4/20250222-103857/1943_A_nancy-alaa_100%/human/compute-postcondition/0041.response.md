Output State: **`first` is False, `n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, and `i` is `n + 1`**.

Explanation: The code sets `first` to `True`. Since `first` was initially `True`, it is now explicitly set to `False`. The values of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `i` remain unchanged as the code does not modify them.
