Output State: **`first` is True, `n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, and `i` is `n + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no further action specified in the else part of the conditional structure (if any), the values of `first`, `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `i` remain unchanged. We simply break out of the loop or if statement.
