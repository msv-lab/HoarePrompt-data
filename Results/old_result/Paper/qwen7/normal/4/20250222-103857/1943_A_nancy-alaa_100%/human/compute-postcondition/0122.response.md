Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `False`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers converted from input.
- `i` is less than `n + 1` and equal to the previous value of `i` + 2.
- If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()` or `mpp[i] != 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the value of `i`:

1. `i` starts with a value less than `n + 1`.
2. `i` is incremented by 2 each time it is updated.
3. The loop or if statement breaks if `i` is not in `mpp.keys()` or `mpp[i] != 1`.

Since no specific values for `n` or `arr` are provided, and no specific values for `mpp` are given, we need to consider the general case where `i` is incremented by 2 until it either meets the condition to break out of the loop or reaches a point where it does not meet the condition.

Given that `i` is incremented by 2 and starts from a value less than `n + 1`, the first few values of `i` would be 0, 2, 4, 6, etc., depending on the starting value and the length of the list.

Without more specific details about `mpp`, we assume the simplest case where `i` does not break out of the loop and continues to increment by 2 until it reaches a point where the condition is met.

Since the problem does not specify a breaking condition within the provided context, the value of `i` will depend on the initial value and the length of the list. However, the most precise answer based on the given information is that `i` will be the first value that does not satisfy the condition `i` in `mpp.keys()` or `mpp[i] == 1`.

Output: **2 (assuming i starts from 0 and increments by 2, the first value that might not satisfy the condition is 2)**
