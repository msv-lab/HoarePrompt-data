Postcondition: `first` is False, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `i` is less than `n + 1`, and if `i` is not a key in `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is False, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
