Output State: **`first` is False, `n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, and the current value of `i` is such that `mpp[i]` equals 1.**

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block. In this case, since there was no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. The `first` variable is explicitly stated to become `False` after the `break` statement, but since it was already `True` in the initial state, it remains `False`. All other variables retain their initial states.
