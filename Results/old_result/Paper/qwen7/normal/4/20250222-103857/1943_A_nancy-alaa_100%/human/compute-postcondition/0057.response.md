Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `False`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers converted from input.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- `i` is `0`.

The value of `i` is such that `mpp[i]` is equal to `1` and `first` is `True`.

Given these conditions, since `first` is `False`, it means that the condition for setting `first` to `True` and updating `i` must have been met earlier in the code, but it is not relevant to the current execution of the print statement. The key point here is that `i` is set such that `mpp[i]` equals `1`.

Therefore, the print statement `print(i)` will simply print the value of `i`.

Output: **0**
