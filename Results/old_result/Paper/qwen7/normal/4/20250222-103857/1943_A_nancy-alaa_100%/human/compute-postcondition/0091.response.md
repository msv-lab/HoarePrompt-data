Output State: **`first` remains False, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `n` is updated to the integer input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in the list `arr`. The variable `n` is already an input integer, and it gets updated to the integer input by the user. The other variables (`first`, `i`, and `mpp`) remain unchanged.
