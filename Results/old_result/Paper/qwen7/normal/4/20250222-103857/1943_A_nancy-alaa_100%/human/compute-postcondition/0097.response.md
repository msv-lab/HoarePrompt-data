Output State: **`first` is False, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `i` must be less than `n + 1`, and the current value of `i` is not a key in `mpp`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned, we assume it is breaking out of the most internal one. All other variables retain their initial states.
