Postcondition: `first` is False, `n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, and if `i` is not a key in `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
