Output State: **`first` remains False, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`**.

Explanation: The line `first = False` does not change any existing values or create new variables. It simply sets the boolean variable `first` to `False`. All other variables (`n`, `arr`, `i`, and `mpp`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
