### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game where Alice picks elements from `a` and appends them to `c`, while Bob removes elements from `a`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The goal is to find the MEX of `c` at the end of the game, assuming both players play optimally.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the size `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - The loop iterates from `0` to `n+1` to find the smallest missing integer (MEX).

3. **Key Issues in the Code:**
   - The code does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob.
   - It assumes that the first occurrence of a unique element will be picked by Alice, and subsequent unique elements will be picked by Bob.
   - This assumption is incorrect because the optimal strategy involves more complex decision-making based on the counts and turns.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice should aim to include the smallest numbers in `c` by picking them first.
   - Bob should remove these smallest numbers to prevent Alice from achieving a higher MEX.
   - The optimal solution involves counting the occurrences and determining the MEX based on the parity of the counts.

5. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function summary states that the function prints the first missing positive integer in the array `arr`. If there are no missing integers, it prints `n + 1`.
   - This summary is misleading because the function does not account for the turns of Alice and Bob and does not compute the MEX correctly.

6. **Correct Implementation:**
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and determine the MEX of `c` based on the optimal strategy.
   - Alice should pick the smallest available number first, and Bob should remove it if it is the smallest available number.
   - The MEX can be determined by checking the smallest number that is not present in the array after all optimal moves.

### Conclusion:

The given code does not correctly simulate the game or determine the optimal MEX. The function summary also does not accurately describe the behavior of the function. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
