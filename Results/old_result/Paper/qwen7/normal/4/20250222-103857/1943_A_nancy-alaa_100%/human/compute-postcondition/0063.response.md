Postcondition: `first` is False, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, and `i` is 0. If `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` does not equal 1 or `first` is not True, the program continues to execute without breaking out of the loop or if statement.
