Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n + 1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `first` remains False
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `arr` is a list of integers converted from input
   - `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`
   - `i` is 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

4. **Determine the next state**: Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1.

5. **Check the loop condition**: After incrementing `i` to 1, the loop will check if `i < n + 1`. Since `i` is now 1 and `n` is still an input integer, the loop will execute as long as `1 <= n`.

6. **Adjust the states**: The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`. The other variables (`first`, `n`, `arr`, and `mpp`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**`first` remains False, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, and `i` is 1.**

State: **`first` remains False, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, and `i` is 1**
