Output State: `first` is True, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the list of integers converted from input, `i` is `n + 1`, and the variable `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` from `0` to `n`. The variable `first` will be `True` if no duplicate elements were found in the array `arr` and the element `n` was encountered exactly once. If a duplicate element was found or the element `n` was encountered more than once, `first` would be `False`. The value of `n` remains as the input integer, `arr` remains the list of integers converted from the input, and `i` becomes `n + 1` after the last iteration of the loop. The `mpp` (Counter object) retains the count of each integer in `arr` without being modified by the loop.
