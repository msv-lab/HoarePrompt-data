Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is the new integer input.
- `f` is the new integer input decreased by 2, so `f = n - 2`.
- `k` is the new integer input decreased by 2, so `k = n - 2`.
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
- `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
