Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n`, `f`, and `f+1` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq f, f+1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order.
- `k` is now `f`.
- `x` is equal to `a[f+1]`.
- `a[k]` is less than `x`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
