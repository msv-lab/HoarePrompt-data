Output State: **`n` is the new integer input, `f` is the new integer input decreased by 2, `k` is the new integer input decreased by 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the input values, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int type using `map(int, ...)` and then creates a list `a` from these integers. Since the initial state mentions that `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, the newly created list `a` will also be sorted in descending order based on the input values. The other variables (`n`, `f`, `k`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
