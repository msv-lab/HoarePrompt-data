Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n, f, and k are positive integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100. a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for all i in range(n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    f -= 1
    k -= 1
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = a[f]
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    if a[k] > x:
        print('NO')
    elif a[k] < x:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n`, `f`, and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq f, k \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `k` is either `f` or `k-1` depending on whether `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x` or greater than `x`, `x` is either `a[f+1]` or `a[f]` depending on the same condition, and `a[k]` is either less than `x` or greater than `x` respectively.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is the first integer input, `f` is the second integer input decreased by 1, `k` is the third integer input decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, no change occurs. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the new integer input, `f` is the new integer input decreased by 2, `k` is the new integer input decreased by 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`. If `a[k] > x`, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
