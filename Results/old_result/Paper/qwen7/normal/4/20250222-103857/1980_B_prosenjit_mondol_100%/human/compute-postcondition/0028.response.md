Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is the first integer input.
- `f` is the second integer input decreased by 1, so `f = second_integer_input - 1`.
- `k` is the third integer input decreased by 1, so `k = third_integer_input - 1`.
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
- `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`, so `x = a[f]`.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
