Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n`, `f`, and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq f, k \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\) for all \(i\) in range \(n\), `n`, `f`, and `k` are assigned the values of the integers read from input.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from input and assigns them to `n`, `f`, and `k`. The initial conditions for `t`, `a`, and the constraints on `n`, `f`, and `k` remain valid.
