Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n`, `f`, and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq f, k \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `k` is either `f` or `k-1` depending on whether `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x` or greater than `x`, `x` is either `a[f+1]` or `a[f]` depending on the same condition, and `a[k]` is either less than `x` or greater than `x` respectively.**
