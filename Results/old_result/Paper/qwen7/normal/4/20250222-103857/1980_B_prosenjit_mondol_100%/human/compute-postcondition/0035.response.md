Output State: **`n` is the new integer input, `f` is the new integer input decreased by 2, `k` is the new integer input decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`, `n`, `f`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `f -= 1` decrements the value of `f` by 1. Initially, `f` was the new integer input decreased by 1. After executing the code, `f` becomes the new integer input decreased by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
