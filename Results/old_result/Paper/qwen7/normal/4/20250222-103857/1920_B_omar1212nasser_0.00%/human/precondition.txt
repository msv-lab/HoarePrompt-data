t is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each test case, n, k, and x are positive integers satisfying \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), \(1 \leq x, k \leq n\), and an array of n integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1000\). Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
