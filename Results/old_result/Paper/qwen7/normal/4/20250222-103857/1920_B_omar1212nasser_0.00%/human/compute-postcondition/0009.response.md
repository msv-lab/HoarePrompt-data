Output State: **`removals` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-1]`, `n` is `elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1]` plus `elements[-1]` minus `elements[-2]`**.

Explanation: 
- The initial state had `removals` being at least 1, `i` being 1, and `s` being `s` minus `elements[-1]`.
- The code updates `n` by adding `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]`. Given `i` is 1 initially, the code becomes `n += elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1]`.
- Since `i` was 1, it is now incremented to 2.
- The value of `n` is updated to `elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1]` plus `elements[-1] - elements[-2]`.

Therefore, the updated values are as described in the Output State.
