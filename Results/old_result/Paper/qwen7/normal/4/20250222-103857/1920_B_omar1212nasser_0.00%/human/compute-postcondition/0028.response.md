Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `removals` (an integer representing the number of elements Alice can remove), `negatives` (an integer representing the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1), and `elements` (a list of integers representing the array elements). It returns 0 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns the maximum value among the list pos, which is calculated as s - 2 * n for each iteration from 1 to 3, where s is the original sum of elements minus the sum of the last 3 elements, and n is the sum of the last 3 elements of `elements`, handling potential IndexError by setting n to 0 if an error occurs.**
