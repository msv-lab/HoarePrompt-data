At which point in the program could such an exception occur? The `IndexError` can occur when trying to access an element in the `elements` list using an index that is out of range. Specifically, this can happen if `negatives + i` or `i` is greater than or equal to the length of the `elements` list.

Summarize what the try except statement accomplishes:
- The `try` block attempts to update the value of `n` by adding the difference between two consecutive elements in the `elements` list.
- If an `IndexError` occurs (meaning the index is out of range), the `except` block sets `n` to 0.

What the program output state is after it is executed:
- `removals` must be at least 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `s` is `s` minus `elements[-2]`.
- `n` is either `elements[-(negatives + 2)] - elements[-2] + elements[-2] - elements[-3]` or 0, depending on whether an `IndexError` occurred.
- `pos` is a list containing the value of `s - 2 * n`.

Output State: **`removals` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-2]`, `n` is `elements[-(negatives + 2)] - elements[-2] + elements[-2] - elements[-3]` or 0 depending on whether an `IndexError` occurred, `pos` is a list containing the value of `s - 2 * n`.**
