Step-by-step analysis:

1. The `try` block attempts to add a value from the `elements` list to `n`.
2. This addition is based on the index `-(negatives + i)` and `-i`, where `i` is 4.
3. If either of these indices is out of range (i.e., less than 0), an `IndexError` will be raised.
4. In the `except` block, if an `IndexError` occurs, `n` is set to 0.

Considering the possible scenarios:

- If no `IndexError` occurs, `n` is updated as follows:
  \[
  n = \text{elements}[-(\text{negatives} + 4)] - \text{elements}[-4] + \text{elements}[-4] - \text{elements}[-5] + \text{elements}[-(\text{negatives} + 4)] - \text{elements}[-4]
  \]
- If an `IndexError` occurs, `n` is set to 0.

Given the initial state and the changes after the `try` and `except` blocks, the final state of the program can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`removals` must be at least 3, `i` is 4, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-4]`, `n` is either `elements[-(negatives + 4)] - elements[-4] + elements[-4] - elements[-5] + elements[-(negatives + 4)] - elements[-4]` if no `IndexError` occurs, or 0 if an `IndexError` occurs, `pos` is a list containing the value of `s - 2 * n`, and `pos` has had the value `s - 2 * n` appended to it.**
