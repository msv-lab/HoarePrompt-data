Output State: **`removals` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-1]`**

Explanation: The code `s -= elements[-i]` subtracts the last element of the list `elements` (which is accessed using `elements[-1]` since `i` is 1) from `s`. The precondition that `removals` must be at least 1 and `i` is 1 remains unchanged. The value of `s` is updated by subtracting the last element of the list `elements`.
