The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three positive integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. It sorts the list `a` and then calls another function `func_2(k, x, a)` to compute a product value for each test case. Finally, it prints the computed product value for each test case.
