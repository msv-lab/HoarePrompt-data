Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a` and then calls `func_2` with parameters `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes three parameters: `removals` (which corresponds to `k`), `negatives` (which corresponds to `x`), and `elements` (which is the sorted array `a`).
   - It has a conditional statement that directly returns `0` if `removals == 6 and negatives == 3`. This is a hardcoded check and doesn't seem to be based on the problem logic.
   - It initializes an empty list `pos` to store potential sums.
   - It calculates the initial sum of the array `s` and the sum of the last `negatives` elements `n`.
   - It appends `s - 2 * n` to `pos`.
   - It iterates from `1` to `removals` and updates `s` and `n` in each iteration.
     - `s` is updated by subtracting the `i-th` largest element from the array.
     - `n` is updated by adding the difference between the `(negatives + i)-th` and `i-th` largest elements, but if this index is out of bounds, `n` is set to `0`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value in `pos`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Hardcoded Check**:
   - The condition `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3: return 0` is hardcoded and does not reflect the general logic required for the problem. This check should be removed.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `n`**:
   - The calculation of `n` in the loop is incorrect. `n` should be the sum of the `negatives` smallest elements in the array, not the sum of the last `negatives` elements.
   - The update of `n` should consider the smallest elements, not the largest ones.

3. **Logic for Optimal Moves**:
   - The logic for determining the optimal moves for Alice and Bob needs to be more robust. The current implementation does not correctly simulate the optimal strategy for both players.

### Corrected Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Remove the `k` largest elements.
2. Flip up to `x` of the remaining negative elements to positive.
3. Calculate the sum of the resulting array.

Here is a corrected version of the functions:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        a = a[:n-k]  # Remove k largest elements
        a = [max(0, -val) for val in a]  # Flip up to x negative elements to positive
        print(sum(a))

def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    # This function is not needed as the logic is integrated into func_1
    pass
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect due to the hardcoded check and the incorrect logic for calculating the sum. The corrected approach should be implemented as shown above.

**Correctness: **False**
