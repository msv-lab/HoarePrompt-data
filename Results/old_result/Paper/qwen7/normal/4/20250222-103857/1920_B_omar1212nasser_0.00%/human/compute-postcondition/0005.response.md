Output State: **`removals` is an integer with a value between 1 and 6, `negatives` is an integer with a value between 1 and 3, `elements` is a list of integers where either `removals` is not equal to 6 or `negatives` is not equal to 3, `pos` is an empty list, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`, `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` and assigns it to `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `removals` is an integer between 1 and 6 and `negatives` is an integer between 1 and 3 still holds. Also, the condition that `removals` is not equal to 6 or `negatives` is not equal to 3 is preserved. The variable `s` remains the sum of all integers in `elements`, and `pos` remains an empty list.
