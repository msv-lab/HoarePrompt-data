### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - This function correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), processes each test case, and prints the result for each test case.
   - It sorts the array `a` and calls `func_2(k, x, a)` to get the optimal sum for each test case.
   - The state transitions and outputs are correctly described in the comments.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - The function has a hardcoded return value of `0` when `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`. This is a specific case and does not reflect the general logic for other inputs.
   - For other cases, the function calculates the optimal sum by removing elements and negating some elements optimally.
   - The function iterates through possible removals and updates the sum `s` and the sum of the last `negatives` elements `n`.
   - It appends the calculated values to the list `pos` and returns the maximum value from this list.

However, there is a critical issue with the function `func_2()`. The hardcoded return value of `0` for the specific case `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3` is not logically consistent with the problem statement. The function should handle all cases generically without such hardcoding.

### Correctness:

Given the specific hardcoded condition in `func_2()`, the function is not correct for all cases. The solution should handle all possible values of `removals` and `negatives` without relying on hardcoded conditions.

**Correctness: **False**
