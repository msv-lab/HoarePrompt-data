To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Variables and Objects Defined:**
   - `t`: An input integer greater than 0.
   - `n`: The length of the first `q` elements of `M`.
   - `m`: The minimum value between `m` and `k`.
   - `k`: `L[2]`.
   - `a`: A list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
   - `M`: A list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
   - `M` is sorted.
   - `q`: The ceiling value of `k / m`.
   - `N`: The first `q` elements of `M`.

2. **Conditions for Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n * m == k`, then `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.

Given the complexity of the problem, let's assume specific values for clarity (though the actual values would depend on the input):

- Suppose `M = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` (sorted).
- Suppose `k = 5` and `m = 2` (since `m` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`).
- Calculate `q` as the ceiling value of `k / m`, so `q = ceil(5 / 2) = 3`.
- Therefore, `N` would be the first 3 elements of `M`, i.e., `N = [1, 2, 3]`.

Now, let's consider both conditions for cost calculation:

- **Condition 1:** If `n * m == k`, then `n = 3` and `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) = 2 * 2 * ((3 - 1) * 3 // 2) = 8 * 3 = 24`.
  - So, `cost = m * sum(N) + 24 = 2 * (1 + 2 + 3) + 24 = 2 * 6 + 24 = 12 + 24 = 36`.

- **Condition 2:** Since `n * m != k`, we need to use the other formula.
  - `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, so `w = 3`.
  - `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m = 5 - (3 - 1) * 2 = 5 - 4 = 1`.
  - `cost = cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu = 36 + 2 * (1 + 2 + 3) + 2 * 2 * ((3 - 1) * (3 - 2) // 2) + 3 * 2 * 1 = 36 + 12 + 4 + 6 = 58`.

Since the exact input values are not specified, we can only describe the general form of the cost calculation based on the given conditions.

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the conditions described above)**
