Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and we are ready to read the next input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
    m = min(m, k)
    M.sort()
    q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
    N = M[:q]
    n = len(N)
    if n * m == k:
        cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
    else:
        w = N.pop()
        mu = k - (n - 1) * m
        cost = mu * w
        n = len(N)
        cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu
    print(cost)
    continue


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `k` is L[2], `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is sorted, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`. The loop continues without changing the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `M`, `q`, `N`, and `cost` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t_prev + 1`, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `k` is `L[2]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers and sorted, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` (excluding the last element in the else part), `L` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, and `mu` is defined as `k - (n - 1) * m` in the else part; the cost is either `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, or `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` if `n * m != k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t_prev - 1`, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` remains the minimum value between `L[1]` and `k`, `k` is `L[2]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` (excluding the last element in the else part), `L` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
