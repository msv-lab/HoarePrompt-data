Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is L[0], `m` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `k` is L[2], `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is sorted.**

The code `M.sort()` sorts the list `M` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `M` retain their initial conditions, except that `M` is now sorted.
