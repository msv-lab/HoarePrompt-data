The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the provided code snippet, the execution context does not change, and all variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is `t_prev + 1`, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `k` is `L[2]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers and sorted, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` (excluding the last element in the else part), `L` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, and `mu` is defined as `k - (n - 1) * m` in the else part; the cost is either `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, or `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` if `n * m != k`.**
