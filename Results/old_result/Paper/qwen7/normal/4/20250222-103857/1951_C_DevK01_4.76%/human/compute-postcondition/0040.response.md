To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the formula for `cost`.

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t = t_prev + 1`: `t` is defined as `t_prev + 1`.
   - `n = len(N)`: `n` is the length of the list `N`.
   - `m = min(m, k)`: `m` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`.
   - `k = L[2]`: `k` is the third element of the list `L`.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
   - `M` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers and sorted.
   - `q = ceil(k / m)`: `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`.
   - `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` (excluding the last element in the else part).
   - `L` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
   - `mu = k - (n - 1) * m` in the else part.
   - `cost` is defined as:
     - `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`.
     - `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` if `n * m != k`.

2. **Determine the value of `cost`:**
   - Since the exact values of `w` and `mu` are not provided, we need to focus on the conditions for `cost`.
   - If `n * m == k`, then `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - If `n * m != k`, then `cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.

Given the initial state, we don't have specific values for `w` and `mu`, but we know the formula for `cost` based on the conditions. Since the exact values of `w` and `mu` are not provided, we can only express `cost` in terms of these variables.

Output: **cost (where cost is either m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) if n * m == k, or mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu if n * m != k)**
