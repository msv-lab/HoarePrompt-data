Output State: **`t` is `t_prev + 1`, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `k` is `L[2]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is a list of integers obtained and sorted, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` excluding the last element, `L` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w`**.

In this output state, the `cost` variable is calculated as `mu * w`, where `mu` is defined as `k - (n - 1) * m`. All other variables retain their previous values or conditions as described in the initial state.
