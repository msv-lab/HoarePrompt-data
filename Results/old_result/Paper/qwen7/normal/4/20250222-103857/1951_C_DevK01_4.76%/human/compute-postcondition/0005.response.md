Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is L[0], `m` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `k` is L[2], `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

In this output state, the variable `m` is updated to be the minimum value between its original value and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
