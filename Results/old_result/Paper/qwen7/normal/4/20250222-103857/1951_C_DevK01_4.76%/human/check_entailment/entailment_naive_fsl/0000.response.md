Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets to be purchased (`k`) is greater than the product of the number of days (`n`) and the maximum tickets that can be purchased per day (`m`). In such cases, the program does not account for the fact that the tickets cannot be purchased beyond the available days.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 2 5
1 2 3 4
```
Here, `n = 3`, `m = 2`, and `k = 5`. According to the problem description, the program should handle this case by distributing the purchases across the available days. However, the current implementation does not correctly distribute the purchases and instead leads to incorrect calculations.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the tickets are distributed across the days in a way that respects the constraints and minimizes the total cost. Specifically, the program should handle cases where `k` exceeds `n * m` by purchasing the maximum allowed tickets per day until `k` tickets are bought.
