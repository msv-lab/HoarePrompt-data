Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M` decreased by 1, `m` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `k` is L[2], `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is sorted, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `cost` as `mu * w`. Here, `mu` is defined as `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `w` is the last element of the list `N` before it is popped. Since `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`, and `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `w` is the second last element of `N`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
