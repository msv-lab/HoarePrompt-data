Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `m` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `k` is L[2], `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is sorted, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, `n` is the ceiling value of `k / m`**.

Explanation:
- The code updates the `cost` by adding `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` to its current value.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is already defined as the ceiling value of `k / m`.
- All other variables remain in their previous states as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
