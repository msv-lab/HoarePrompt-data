Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `k` is L[2], `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is sorted, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`. The loop continues without changing the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `M`, `q`, `N`, and `cost` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified within the scope of the `continue` statement, their values remain the same as they were before the statement was executed.
