Postcondition: `k` is updated to the position of `d[j]` starting from index `k` in the list `e`, plus 1. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, then `k` is set to `j + 1`. If `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, `k` is set to `j` and `j` retains its original value, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.
