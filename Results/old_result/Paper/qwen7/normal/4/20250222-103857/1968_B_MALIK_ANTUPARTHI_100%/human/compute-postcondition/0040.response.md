Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is equal to `b-1`
- `b` is greater than 0
- `k` is either `c` (if `j` equals `b-1`) or `k` is set to `b` (if `k` does not equal `c` and `j` does not equal `b-1`)

We need to determine the value of `k` when the print statement `print(k)` is executed.

Given that `j = b-1`, it directly satisfies the condition for `k` to be equal to `c`. Therefore, `k` must be `c`.

Output: **c**
