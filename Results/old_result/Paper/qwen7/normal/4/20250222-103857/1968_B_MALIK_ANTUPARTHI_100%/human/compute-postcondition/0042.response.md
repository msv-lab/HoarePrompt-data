Output State: **`j` is equal to `b-1`, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `k` is either `c` (if `j` equals `b-1`) or `b` (if `k` does not equal `c` and `j` does not equal `b-1`), `i` is `b`.**

Explanation: The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `b` and `c` respectively. The initial values of `j` and `k` remain unchanged, and `i` is still equal to `b`. Since the exact values of `j` and `k` are dependent on the initial conditions, they are described in terms of their relationships to `b` and `c`.
