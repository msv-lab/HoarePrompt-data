Output State: **`j` is 0; `b` is greater than 0; `i` is `b + 1`; `k` is 0; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no loop or conditional statement is specified in the code snippet, we assume it is breaking out of an implied loop or conditional. The values of `j`, `b`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged.
