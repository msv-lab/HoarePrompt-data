Postcondition: `k` and `j` are indices. If `d[j]` is found in the sublist `e[k:]`, then `k` is updated to the position of `d[j]` starting from index `k` in the list `e`, plus 1. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, then `k` is set to `j + 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. If `d[j]` is not found in the sublist `e[k:]`, then `k` is equal to `j`, and `j` retains its original value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
