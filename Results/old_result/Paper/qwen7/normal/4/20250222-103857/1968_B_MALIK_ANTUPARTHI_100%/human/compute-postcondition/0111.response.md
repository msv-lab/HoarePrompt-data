Output State: **`j` is `j_current + 1`; `k` is `e[k:].index(d[j_current + 1]) + 1 + k`; `k` is `j + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` to be `j + 1`. Since `j` was previously `j_current + 1`, the new value of `k` is now `j_current + 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `j_current + 2`. This new value of `k` also satisfies the condition `k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k` because `j` is now `j_current + 1`. Therefore, the updated state of `k` is `e[k:].index(d[j_current + 1]) + 1 + k`, which simplifies to `e[k:].index(d[j_current + 1]) + 1 + (j_current + 1)`. However, since the assignment `k = j + 1` directly sets `k` to `j + 1`, the more direct representation is used in the output state.
