Output State: **`j` is `j_current + 1`; `k` is `e[k:].index(d[j_current + 1]) + 1 + k`; `k` is `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there are no loops or conditionals specified in the code snippet, the only effect is that the execution exits the current context. The values of `j`, `k`, and `j_current` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `j` and `k` as defined initially and indicates that the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
