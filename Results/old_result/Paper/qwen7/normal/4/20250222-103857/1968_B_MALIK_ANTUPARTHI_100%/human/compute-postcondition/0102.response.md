Output State: **`k` is `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `k` and `j`, but it indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the relationship between `k` and `j` remains the same (`k` is `j + 1`), and we simply note that we have broken out of the loop or conditional statement.
