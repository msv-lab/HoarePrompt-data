Based on the initial state described:

- The loop continues to execute until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`. This means that `low` and `high` have converged such that `low + 1 == high`.
- The set `st` includes all the midpoints calculated during the iterations, which are the points where the binary search process narrowed down the range.
- `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

Given the print statement `print(1)`, it directly prints the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
