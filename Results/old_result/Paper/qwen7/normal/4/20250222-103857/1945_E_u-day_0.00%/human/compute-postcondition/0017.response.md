Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is an integer, and `pos` is set to the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `k` if such an index exists; otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged.

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations (i.e., `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`), `pos` will hold the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found in `arr`, or it will remain `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`.
