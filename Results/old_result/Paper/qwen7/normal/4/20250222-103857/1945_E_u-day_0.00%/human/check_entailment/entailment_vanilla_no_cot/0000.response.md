Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the binary search is not applied to rearrange the permutation so that `p_l` equals `x`. Instead, it attempts to find the position of `x` in the array and then performs a single swap if necessary. This approach does not guarantee that the binary search will correctly find `x` after the swaps, as required by the problem statement.

The problem requires rearranging the permutation with at most two swaps so that the binary search will find `x` at the first position (`p_l`). The provided solution does not achieve this.
