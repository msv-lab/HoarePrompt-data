Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is an integer, and `pos` is set to the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `k` if such an index exists; otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged; `st` is an empty set.**

The code creates an empty set named `st`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, their states remain as they were in the initial state.
