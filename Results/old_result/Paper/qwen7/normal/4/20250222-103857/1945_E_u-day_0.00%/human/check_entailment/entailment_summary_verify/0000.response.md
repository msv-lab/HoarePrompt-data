### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description step-by-step.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to rearrange the permutation `p` such that `p_l` equals `x` after performing at most 2 swaps.
- After rearranging, we perform a binary search to find `x`.
- The binary search should terminate with `p_l == x`.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - Reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   
2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - Converts the result of `func_1` into a list of integers.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - Takes `n`, `k`, and a list `arr` as input.
   - Finds the position of `k` in `arr` and stores it in `pos`.
   - Performs a binary search to find the position of `k` in the sorted list.
   - If `k` is found, it prints `0`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `1` followed by the positions of `low` and `pos`.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The function `func_3` does not sort the list `arr` before performing the binary search.
   - The binary search is performed on the unsorted list, which means it might not find the correct position of `k`.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program does not explicitly handle the swapping logic to ensure `p_l` becomes `x`.
   - It only checks if `k` is present in the list and prints the result accordingly.

#### Correctness of the Provided Program:
- The provided program does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm as described in the problem statement. It does not ensure that the element `p_l` is equal to `x` after the algorithm completes.
- The program attempts to find the position of `k` in the array using a modified binary search approach, but it does not guarantee that `p_l` will be equal to `x` after the algorithm ends.
- The program does not handle the case where the element `x` is not present in the array, leading to incorrect results.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
- Consider the test case:
  ```
  1
  3 2
  1 3 2
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  1 3
  ```
- Actual Output (as per the provided program):
  ```
  0
  ```
- The program does not perform any swaps and incorrectly concludes that `x` is not present in the array.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. It does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm and does not ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the algorithm completes.

**Final: False**
