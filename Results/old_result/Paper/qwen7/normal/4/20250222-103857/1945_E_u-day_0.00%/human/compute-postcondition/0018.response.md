Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is an integer, and `pos` is set to the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `k` if such an index exists; otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `low` and `high`. `low` is set to 0, and `high` is set to `n - 1`. The values of `n`, `arr`, `i`, `k`, and `pos` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `i` is not affected by this line of code since it was already set to `n` before the line was executed.
