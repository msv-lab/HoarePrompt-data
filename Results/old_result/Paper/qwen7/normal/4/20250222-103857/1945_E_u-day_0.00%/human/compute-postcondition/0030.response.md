Postcondition: `low`, `high`, `mid`, `n`, `arr`, `i`, `k`, `pos`, and `st` remain as defined in the precondition. If `arr[mid] > k`, then `low` becomes `0` and `high` becomes `mid`, and `st` still contains the value `mid`. Otherwise, `low` becomes `mid` and `high` becomes `n - 1`, and `st` still contains the value `mid`.
