Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `(0 + (n - 1)) // 2`, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is an integer, and `pos` is set to the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `k` if such an index exists; otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged; `st` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The code calculates the midpoint `mid` of the range defined by `low` and `high`. Since `low` is 0 and `high` is `n - 1`, `mid` is calculated as `(0 + (n - 1)) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
