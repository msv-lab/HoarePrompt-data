Based on the initial state provided:

- The loop continues to execute until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`.
- The final values of `low`, `high`, and `mid` depend on the distribution of `k` within the sorted list `arr`.
- The set `st` contains all the unique values of `mid` that were computed during each iteration of the loop.
- The current value of `low` is such that `arr[low]` is equal to `k`.
- The set `st` includes all the midpoints calculated during the iterations, which are the points where the binary search process narrowed down the range.

The `print(0)` statement will simply print the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
