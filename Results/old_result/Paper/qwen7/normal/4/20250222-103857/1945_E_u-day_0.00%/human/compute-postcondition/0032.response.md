Output State: **`low` is an integer, `high` is an integer, and `low + 1 < high`; `mid` is now `(low + high) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the midpoint between `low` and `high` and assigns it to `mid`. Since `low + 1 < high` was true before the code execution, it remains true after the code execution. The value of `low` and `high` does not change, only `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`.
