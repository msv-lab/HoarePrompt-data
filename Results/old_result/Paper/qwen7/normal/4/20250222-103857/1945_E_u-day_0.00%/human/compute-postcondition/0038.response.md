Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `low + 1 < high`. This means the loop continues as long as the difference between `high` and `low` is greater than 1.

2. **Identify the Loop Body**: The loop body is omitted, but we know that based on the postconditions given, if `arr[mid] > k`, then `high` is set to `mid`, otherwise `low` is set to `mid`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `low`, `high`, and `mid` are integers.
   - `low + 1 < high` (this is the loop condition).
   - `mid` is now `(low + high) // 2`.
   - `st` is a set containing the value of `mid`.

4. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `low + 1 < high`.
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to maintain the condition `low + 1 < high`.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `mid` is recalculated in each iteration as `(low + high) // 2`, and `st` contains the value of `mid`, these values do not need to be adjusted.
   - The only variables that affect the loop condition are `low` and `high`. We need to ensure that `low + 1 < high` remains true.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `low` and `high` must still satisfy the condition `low + 1 < high`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `low` and `high` to ensure the condition `low + 1 < high` holds true.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`low`, `high`, and `mid` are integers, `low + 1 < high`, `mid` is now `(low + high) // 2`, and `st` is a set containing the value of `mid`.**
