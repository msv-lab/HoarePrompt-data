Reasoning:
- The problem requires us to rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search can correctly identify the target value \(x\) as \(p_l\).
- The provided code in `func_3` does not actually perform the necessary swaps to rearrange the permutation. Instead, it performs a binary search on the given permutation without modifying it.
- The function `func_3` does not implement the logic to find and swap the required elements to ensure the binary search works correctly.
- The output format and requirements for the swaps are not followed in the current implementation.

Given that the function `func_3` does not correctly implement the logic to rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
