Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. The objects involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 before entering the loop.
   - `n` is a positive integer.

3. **Ensure the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`). 

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 to allow the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
