Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `low + 1 < high`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as the difference between `high` and `low` is greater than 1.

2. **Loop Body**: The loop body involves checking `arr[mid]` against `k` and updating `low`, `high`, and `st` based on the comparison result:
   - If `arr[mid] > k`, then `low` becomes `0` and `high` becomes `mid`, and `st` still contains the value `mid`.
   - Otherwise, `low` becomes `mid` and `high` becomes `n - 1`, and `st` still contains the value `mid`.

3. **Current State**: We need to determine the necessary adjustments to the states of `low`, `high`, and `st` for the loop to execute one more time.

### Determining the Necessary Adjustments:

- **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `low + 1 < high` must still hold true.
- **Possible Scenarios**:
  - If `arr[mid] > k`, then `low` becomes `0` and `high` becomes `mid`. In this case, the new `low` is `0` and the new `high` is `mid`. Since `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, the new `high` will be less than `n - 1` (since `mid` is less than `high`).
  - If `arr[mid] <= k`, then `low` becomes `mid` and `high` becomes `n - 1`. In this case, the new `low` will be `mid` and the new `high` will be `n - 1`.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `low + 1 < high` must still hold true. Therefore, the states of `low`, `high`, and `st` need to be adjusted such that `low + 1 < high` remains valid.

### Final Answer:

State: **`low` is an integer, `high` is an integer, and `low + 1 < high`, and `st` still contains the value `mid`**.
