Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer representing the length of the permutation), k (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and arr (a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation). The function returns an element from the list arr at index k-1.**

This means the function takes a list `arr` which contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, a positive integer `n` indicating the length of the list, and an integer `k` within the range from 1 to `n`. It then returns the element at the `(k-1)`th index of the list `arr`.
