You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is an integer, and `pos` is set to the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `k` if such an index exists; otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations (i.e., `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`), `pos` will hold the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found in `arr`, or it will remain `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`.
    low, high = 0, n - 1
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: Output State: The loop continues to execute until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`. At this point, the final values of `low`, `high`, and `mid` will depend on the distribution of `k` within the sorted list `arr`. The set `st` will contain all the unique values of `mid` that were computed during each iteration of the loop. 
    #
    #The exact values of `low`, `high`, and `mid` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `arr` and `k`, but they will be such that `low + 1` is not less than `high`. The set `st` will include all the midpoints calculated during the iterations, which are the points where the binary search process narrowed down the range.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: low + 1, pos + 1 (where low + 1 is the value of high and pos is the position related to low or high)
    #State: The loop continues to execute until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`. At this point, the final values of `low`, `high`, and `mid` will depend on the distribution of `k` within the sorted list `arr`. The set `st` will contain all the unique values of `mid` that were computed during each iteration of the loop. Whether `arr[low]` is equal to `k` or not, the set `st` includes all the midpoints calculated during the iterations, which are the points where the binary search process narrowed down the range.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer representing the length of the permutation), k (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and arr (a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation). The function returns an element from the list arr at index k-1.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
