Based on the initial state provided, the loop continues until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`. This means that at the point of execution of the `print` statement, `low + 1` is equal to `high`. 

Given that `low + 1` is equal to `high`, and considering the nature of the binary search algorithm, `low` and `high` represent the boundaries of the last narrowed-down range where the target value `k` was not found. Since `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, it implies that `k` does not exist in the array within the range `[low, high)`.

The `mid` values stored in the set `st` are the points where the binary search process narrowed down the range. However, these specific values of `mid` do not directly affect the output of the `print` statement.

The `pos` variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the `print` statement. Given the context, `pos` likely refers to the position of `low` or `high` in the array, but without more information, we cannot determine its exact value.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the values of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

Output: **low + 1, pos + 1 (where low + 1 is the value of high and pos is the position related to low or high)**
