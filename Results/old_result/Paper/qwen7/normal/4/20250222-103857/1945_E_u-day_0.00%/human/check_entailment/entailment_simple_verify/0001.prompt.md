You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

    #
    #This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations (i.e., `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`), `pos` will hold the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found in `arr`, or it will remain `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`.

    #State: The loop continues to execute until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`. At this point, the final values of `low`, `high`, and `mid` will depend on the distribution of `k` within the sorted list `arr`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to rearrange a permutation array using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search on the modified array finds the target value `x` at the first position (`p_l`).

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The binary search algorithm is implemented correctly in terms of its logic. However, it's important to note that the algorithm is not applied to the permutation directly but rather to the modified permutation.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The function `func_3` attempts to find the index `pos` where `arr[pos] == k`.
   - It then performs a binary search-like operation to identify the correct position `low` where the target `k` should be placed.
   - If `arr[low]` equals `k`, no swaps are needed, and the function prints `0`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `1` and swaps the elements at positions `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

4. **Issues with the Code**:
   - The function `func_3` does not actually modify the array `arr` to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x`. Instead, it just prints the number of operations and the positions to swap without changing the array.
   - The binary search-like operation is not necessary because the problem guarantees that 2 operations are always sufficient. This means we don't need to perform the binary search-like operation to find the exact position; we only need to place `k` in the correct position.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to find the position of `k` in the array.
   - If `k` is already at the first position, no swaps are needed.
   - If `k` is not at the first position, we need to swap it with either the first element or another element to make sure `p_l` is `k`.

### Corrected Solution:

```python
def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
            break
    if pos == 0:
        print(0)
    elif pos == 1:
        print(1)
        print(1, 2)
    else:
        print(2)
        print(1, pos + 1)
        print(pos, pos + 1)

# Example usage
func_3()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
- Find the position of `k` in the array.
- If `k` is already at the first position, no swaps are needed.
- If `k` is at the second position, swap the first and second elements.
- If `k` is at any other position, first swap `k` with the first element, then swap the first and second elements to ensure `p_l` is `k`.

### Conclusion:
The original code does not correctly implement the solution as it does not modify the array to meet the requirement. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
