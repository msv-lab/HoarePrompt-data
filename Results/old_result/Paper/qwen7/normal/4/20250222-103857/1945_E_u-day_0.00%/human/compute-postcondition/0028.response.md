Output State: **`low` is `mid`, `high` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `(0 + (n - 1)) // 2`, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is an integer, `pos` is set to the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `k` if such an index exists; otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged, `st` is a set containing the value `mid`, and `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The variable `low` is updated to the value of `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
