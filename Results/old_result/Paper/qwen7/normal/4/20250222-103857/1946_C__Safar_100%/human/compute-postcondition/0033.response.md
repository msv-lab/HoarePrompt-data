Postcondition: **`stack` is [(1, 1)], `x` is 1, `p` is 1, `A` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `g` is a dictionary where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 â‰¤ k < n - 1; `visited` is a set containing the element 1; `d` is a dictionary with key (1) and value either 1 or 2 depending on whether `d[x]` is greater than or equal to `A`; `r` is 1 if `d[x]` is greater than or equal to `A`, otherwise `r` is 0.**
