Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `stack` is [(1, 1)], `x` is 1, `p` is 1, `A` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `g` is a dictionary where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n - 1; `visited` is a set containing `1`; `d` is a dictionary with key (1) and value 1; `r` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for node in g[x]:
    if node != p:
        stack.append((node, x))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `stack` is either [(1, 1), (node, x)] or remains [(1, 1)], `x` is 1, `p` is 1, `A` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `g` is a dictionary where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices (must contain at least one element for key 1), `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n - 1; `visited` is a set containing `1`; `d` is a dictionary with key (1) and value 1; `r` is 0, and the current node is either not equal to `p` or remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `stack` is either `[(1, 1), (new_node, 1), (node, x)]` or `[(1, 1), (node, x)]`, `x` is one of the neighbors of `1`, `p` is 1, `A` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing `k` edges, `g` is a dictionary where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices (must contain at least one element for key 1), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq k < n - 1\), `visited` is a set containing `1`, `d` is a dictionary with key `(1)` and value `1`, `r` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `stack` is either `[(1, 1), (new_node, 1), (node, x), (node, x)]` or `[(1, 1), (node, x), (node, x)]`, `x` is one of the neighbors of `1`, `p` is 1, `A` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing `k` edges, `g` is a dictionary where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices (must contain at least one element for key 1), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq k < n - 1\), `visited` is a set containing `1`, `d` is a dictionary with key `(1)` and value `1`, `r` is 0, `node` is the next neighbor of `x`, and the stack does not change if `node` is not equal to `p`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
