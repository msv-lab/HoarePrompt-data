Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is equal to `r` + 1, `r` is now `n - k - 1`, `end` is `2k + 1`, `ans` is `le - max(st, 2k + 1)`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is the last incremented value of `st` inside the loop.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the conditions of the variables remain as follows:
- `l` is equal to `r` + 1 because the loop continues as long as `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
- `r` is now `n - k - 1` because `r` is decremented by 1 each time the loop runs.
- `end` is `2k + 1` because it starts at 2 and increments by 1 with each iteration.
- `ans` is updated to `le - max(st, 2k + 1)` where `le` is the length of list `a` and `st` is the last incremented value of `st` inside the loop.
