Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`. The variables involved in this condition are `l`, `r`, and `a`.

2. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - `l < r`: This ensures that `l` is less than `r`.
   - `a[l] == a[l + 1]`: This ensures that the elements at indices `l` and `l + 1` in the list `a` are equal.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `le` is the length of list `a`.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.
   - `st` is 1.
   - `end` is 1.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For `l < r` to be true, `l` (which is 0) must be less than `r` (which is `n - 1`). Since `l` is 0, `r` must be greater than 0.
   - For `a[l] == a[l + 1]` to be true, the elements at indices `l` and `l + 1` in the list `a` must be equal. Since `l` is 0, we need `a[0] == a[1]`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - We need to ensure that `r` is greater than 0.
   - We need to ensure that `a[0] == a[1]`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `r` must be greater than 0 and `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `le` is the length of list `a`, `l` is 0, `r` must be greater than 0, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `st` is 1, `end` is 1**.
