Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, `end` is equal to `l + 1`, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `le` is the length of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code updates the values of `l` and `r`. Initially, `r` was defined as `l - 1`, so now `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
