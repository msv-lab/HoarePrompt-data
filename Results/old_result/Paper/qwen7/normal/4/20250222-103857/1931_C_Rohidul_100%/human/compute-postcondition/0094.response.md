Output State: **`le` is the length of the new list `a`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` and continue to be equal to subsequent elements until `le-1`, `l` is equal to `r-2`, `st` is `n`, `r` is now `l+1-1` which is `l`, `end` is increased by 1 to `end+1`, and `a[l+1]` must be equal to `a[l]`**.

This means that the value of `r` has been decremented by 1, making it equal to `l`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
