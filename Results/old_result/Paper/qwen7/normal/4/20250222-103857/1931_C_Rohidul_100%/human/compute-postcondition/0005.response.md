Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `le` is the length of list `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 1, `end` is 1.**

The code initializes two variables `st` and `end` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
