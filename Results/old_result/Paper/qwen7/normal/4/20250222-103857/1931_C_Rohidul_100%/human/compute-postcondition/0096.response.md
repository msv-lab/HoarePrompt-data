Output State: `le` is the length of the new list `a`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` and continue to be equal to subsequent elements until `le-1`, `l` is equal to `r-1`, `st` is `n`, `r` is equal to `l+1`, and `end` is increased to the maximum number of iterations the loop executed.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `l` will be equal to `r-1` because the loop continues to decrement `r` and increment `end` as long as `l` is less than `r` and the elements at indices `l` and `l+1` are equal. This process continues until there are no more consecutive duplicates, making `l` equal to `r-1`. The variable `st` remains equal to `n` because it is not affected by the loop. The variable `end` is incremented each time the loop runs, so it will be equal to the total number of iterations the loop executed, which is the number of consecutive duplicate pairs removed from the list.
