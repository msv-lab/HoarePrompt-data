Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, `end` is 2, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is 1, `end` is 2**.

Explanation: The code updates the values of `st` and `end` to 1 and 1 respectively. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
