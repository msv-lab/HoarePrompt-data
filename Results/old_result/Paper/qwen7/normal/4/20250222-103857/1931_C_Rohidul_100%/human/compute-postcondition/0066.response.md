Output State: **`ans` is max(0, le - ((n - k - 1) + (2k + 1))), `l` is equal to `r` + 1, the current value of `r` is `n - k - 1`, `end` is `2k + 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input where the first and last elements are equal, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is the last incremented value of `st` inside the loop.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of 0 and the difference between `le` and the sum of `st` and `end`. Given the initial conditions, `st` remains unchanged, `end` is `2k + 1`, and `r` is `n - k - 1`, so the updated value of `ans` is calculated as `max(0, le - (st + end))`. All other variables remain in their initial states.
