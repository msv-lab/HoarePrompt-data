Output State: **`end` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is equal to `r` + 1, `r` is decremented by 1, `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]` must be equal.**

Explanation: The variable `end` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `l`, `r`, and the condition involving `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]` remain unchanged from the initial state.
