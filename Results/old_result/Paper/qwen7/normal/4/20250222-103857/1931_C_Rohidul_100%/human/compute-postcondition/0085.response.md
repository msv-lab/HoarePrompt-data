Output State: `le` is the length of the new list `a`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` and continue to be equal to subsequent elements until the end of the list, `l` is equal to `r - 1` (or `r` if `r` changes due to list modifications), `st` is `r - l + 1`.

This means that the loop continues to increment `l` and increase `st` as long as `a[l]` equals `a[l + 1]`. The loop will terminate when `l` is no longer less than `r` or when `a[l]` is not equal to `a[l + 1]`. At the end of the loop, all consecutive duplicate elements in the list `a` starting from index 0 have been removed, and `st` reflects the number of such removals.
