Output State: **`r` is one less than `l`, meaning `r = l - 1`; `end` is equal to `l + 1`; `ans` is `le - max(st, l + 1)`; `ans` is also equal to `max(0, le - (st + end))`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of 0 and the difference between `le` and the sum of `st` and `end`. Given the initial conditions, `end` is `l + 1`, so the expression simplifies to `ans = max(0, le - (st + (l + 1)))`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
