Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `le` is the length of list `a`, `l` is equal to `r - 1`, `r` is less than `n`, `a[l]` is not equal to `a[l + 1]`, `st` is the total number of times the loop has executed, `end` is 1.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`. Each iteration increments `l` and increases `st` by 1. After all iterations, the loop condition will no longer be satisfied, meaning either `l` will be equal to `r - 1` or `a[l]` will no longer be equal to `a[l + 1]`. The value of `st` will be the total number of times the loop has executed, which is the count of consecutive identical elements from the start of the list until the last pair of elements where they are not equal.
