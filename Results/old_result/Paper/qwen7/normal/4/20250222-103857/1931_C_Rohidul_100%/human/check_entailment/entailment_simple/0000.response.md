Reasoning:

1. The program iterates over each test case, reading the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
2. It then calculates the length of the array `le`.
3. The variables `l` and `r` are used to find the starting and ending positions where the array elements are different from their neighbors.
4. The variable `st` counts the length of the prefix where all elements are the same, and `end` counts the length of the suffix where all elements are the same.
5. The variable `ans` is calculated as the length of the array minus the maximum of `st` and `end`, which represents the minimum cost to make all elements equal by potentially changing the entire prefix or suffix.
6. If the first and last elements of the array are the same, it adjusts `ans` to account for the overlap between the prefix and suffix.
7. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps taken, the program correctly identifies the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal by considering the prefix and suffix where elements are the same. The approach ensures that the operation is applied only once and optimally.

Correctness: **True**
