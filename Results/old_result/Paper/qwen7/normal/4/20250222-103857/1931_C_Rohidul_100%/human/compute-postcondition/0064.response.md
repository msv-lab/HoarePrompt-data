Postcondition: `n` is an input integer, `l` is equal to `r` + 1, the current value of `r` is `n - k - 1`, `end` is `2k + 1`, `ans` is `le - max(st, 2k + 1)`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input with the first and last elements being equal, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is the last incremented value of `st` inside the loop.
