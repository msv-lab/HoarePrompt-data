Postcondition: `n` is an input integer, `l` is equal to `r` + 1, `r` is now `n - k - 1`, `end` is `2k + 1`, `ans` is max(0, le - ((n - k - 1) + (2k + 1))), `a` is a list of integers obtained from input where the first and last elements are equal, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is the last incremented value of `st` inside the loop.
