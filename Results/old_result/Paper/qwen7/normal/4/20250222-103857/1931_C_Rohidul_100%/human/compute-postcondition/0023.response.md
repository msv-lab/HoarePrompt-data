Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `r` is now `r - 1`.
   - `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.
   - `end` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine what needs to change for the loop to continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must be true.
   - Since `r` is now `r - 1`, we need to ensure that `r` is still greater than `l` and that `a[r]` is still equal to `a[r - 1]`.

Given the current state:
- `r` is now `r - 1`.
- `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.
- `end` is increased by 1.

To ensure the loop can execute again:
- `r` must be greater than `l`.
- `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.

Since `r` is already `r - 1`, we need to ensure that `r` (which is now `r - 1`) is still greater than `l`. Additionally, `a[r]` must still be equal to `a[r - 1]`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `r` must be greater than `l`.
- `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.

The state at the end of the previous iteration is already reflecting that `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, so no additional adjustment is needed for this part. However, we need to ensure that `r` is still greater than `l`.

State: **`r` is greater than `l`, and `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`**.
