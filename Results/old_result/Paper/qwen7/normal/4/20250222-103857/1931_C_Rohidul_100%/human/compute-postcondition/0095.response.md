Output State: **`le` is the length of the new list `a`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` and continue to be equal to subsequent elements until `le-1`, `l` is equal to `r-2`, `st` is `n`, `r` is now `l+1-1` which is `l`, `end` is increased by 1 to `end+1`, and `a[l+1]` must be equal to `a[l]`; `end` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `end` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their previous conditions and values.
