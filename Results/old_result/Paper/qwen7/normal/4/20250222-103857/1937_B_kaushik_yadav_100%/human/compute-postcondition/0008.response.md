Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is an empty string, `work` is True.**

The variable `work` is assigned the boolean value `True`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state includes all the original variables with their respective values and the new state of `work`.
