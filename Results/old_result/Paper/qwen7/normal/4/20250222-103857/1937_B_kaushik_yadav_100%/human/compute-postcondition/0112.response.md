Postcondition: `counter` is 2, `i` is either 2 or 3, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `ans` is either `a[0]` or `a[0] + b[2]`, `work` is True, `j` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, and the current value of `i` is either incremented to 2 or 3 depending on whether `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a` or if `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`.
