Output State: **`counter` is 2, `i` is either 2 or 3, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `ans` is `a[0] + b[i]`, `work` is either True or False, `j` is 3, `t` is greater than 0, and `len(a)` must be greater than 3**.

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated by adding `b[i]` to its current value. Since `i` is either 2 or 3, `ans` will become `a[0] + b[2]` or `a[0] + b[3]`, depending on the value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
