Output State: **`counter` is 2, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `ans` is a string containing characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `work` is a boolean which remains unchanged, `j` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, and `a` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` reads an input string and strips its leading and trailing spaces, assigning the result to `b`. The other variables (`counter`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `ans`, `work`, `j`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
