Output State: **`counter` is either 4 or 2, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `work`, `t` retain their original states.**

Explanation: The value of `counter` is incremented by 1. Since `counter` was either 3 or 1, after incrementing, it becomes either 4 or 2. The values of `j`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `work`, and `t` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
