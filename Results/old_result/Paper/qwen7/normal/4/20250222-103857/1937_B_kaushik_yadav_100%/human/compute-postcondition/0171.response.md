Postcondition: `counter` is either 3 or 1 depending on the following conditions: 
- If `a[j + 1] == b[j]`, then `counter` remains as 3.
- If `a[j + 1] != b[j]` and the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` is false, then `counter` is 2.
- If `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'` initially, and `a[j + 2]` equals `b[j + 1]`, then `counter` is 1.
- In all other cases, `counter` is 1.
All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `work`, `j`, `t`) retain their original states, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
