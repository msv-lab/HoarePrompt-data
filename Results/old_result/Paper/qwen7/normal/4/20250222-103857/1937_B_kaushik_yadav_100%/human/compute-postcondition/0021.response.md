Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is the first character of `a`, `work` is True, and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 1, so now `i` is 2. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `work` remain unchanged because they were not affected by the code. Additionally, the condition regarding the characters at specific indices in `b` and `a` also remains unchanged.
