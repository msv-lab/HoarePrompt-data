Postcondition: `counter` is 2, `i` is either 3 or 4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `ans` is `a[0] + a[i+1]`, `work` is either False or remains unchanged, `j` is 3, `t` is greater than 0, and `len(a)` is greater than 3. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `i` remains 3 and `ans` is `a[0] + a[4]`. Otherwise, `i` becomes 4 and `ans` is `a[0] + a[5]`.
