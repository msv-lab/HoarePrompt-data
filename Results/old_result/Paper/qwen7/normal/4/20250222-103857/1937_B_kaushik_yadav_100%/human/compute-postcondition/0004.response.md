Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces**.

Explanation: The code `a = input().strip()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to `a`. The `.strip()` method removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the input. Since `n` was an input integer before this operation, it remains unchanged. The new variable `a` holds the stripped input string.
