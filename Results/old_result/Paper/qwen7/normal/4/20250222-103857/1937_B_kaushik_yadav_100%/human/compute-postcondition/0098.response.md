Output State: **`counter` is 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `ans` is `a[0]`, `work` is True, `j` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, and `len(a)` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the string `ans`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `ans` becomes `a[0]`. After this operation, `i` is incremented by 1 (though the increment is not shown in the code snippet, it is implied in the logic), making `i` equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
