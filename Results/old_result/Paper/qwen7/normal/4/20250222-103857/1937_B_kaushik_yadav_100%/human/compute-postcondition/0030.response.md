Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is a string with the character `a[i]` appended to it, and `work` is a boolean.**

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `a` to the string `ans`. The values of `i`, `n`, `b`, and `work` remain unchanged.
