Output State: **`counter` is either 4 or 2 if the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` is met during the last iteration; otherwise, `counter` is 1 if the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` is met during any iteration before the loop exits; `i` is 0; `work` is True.**

The variable `work` is assigned the boolean value `True`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `counter`, `i`, and `work` are updated accordingly as described above.
