Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `input` is now set to `sys.stdin.readline`**.

Explanation: The code `input = sys.stdin.readline` simply reassigns the `input` variable to refer to the `sys.stdin.readline` function. This does not change the value of `t`, nor does it affect the constraints or the nature of `n` or the binary strings. Therefore, the only change is that `input` is now specifically set to `sys.stdin.readline`.
