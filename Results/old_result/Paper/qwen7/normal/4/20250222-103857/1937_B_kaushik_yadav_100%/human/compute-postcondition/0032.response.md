Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is a string with the character `b[i]` appended to it, and `work` is a boolean.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `b` to the string `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state of `i` was `i + 1`, it remains `i + 1`. The value of `ans` is updated by appending the character at index `i` of `b` to it.
