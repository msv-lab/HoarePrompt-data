Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is at least 1, `i` is 6, `k` is an empty list, `b` is the input string from the user.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is assigned the value of the input provided by the user using `input()`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `i`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
