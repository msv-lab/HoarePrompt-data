Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid of '0's and '1's. For each test case, it checks if the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square made up of '1's, where the size of the shape is greater than 1. If the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal, it prints these counts. The function does not return any value but prints the counts if the condition is met.**
