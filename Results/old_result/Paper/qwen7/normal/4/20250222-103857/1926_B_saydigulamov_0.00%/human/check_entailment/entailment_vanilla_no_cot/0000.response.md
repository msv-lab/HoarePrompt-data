Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly identify whether the shape on the grid is a triangle or a square. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Shapes**: 
   - The program appends the count of '1's in each row to the list `k`. However, this alone does not provide enough information to distinguish between a triangle and a square.
   - For a square, the counts should be the same for all rows (since each row has the same number of '1's).
   - For a triangle, the counts will increase linearly (e.g., 1, 3, 5, ...).

2. **Output Logic**:
   - The program only checks if the first two counts in `k` are the same (`if k[0] == k[1]:`). This is insufficient because it doesn't account for the pattern of increasing counts in a triangle.
   - Additionally, the program prints `k`, which is not required according to the problem statement.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly identify the shape, you need to:
1. Check if the counts of '1's in each row match the pattern of a square.
2. Check if the counts of '1's in each row match the pattern of a triangle.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check for square
        square = True
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[j].count('1') != n - j:
                square = False
                break
        
        # Check for triangle
        triangle = True
        for j in range(1, n):
            if grid[j].count('1') != 2 * j + 1:
                triangle = False
                break
        
        if square:
            print("SQUARE")
        elif triangle:
            print("TRIANGLE")
        else:
            print("NO SHAPE")

func()
```

This code correctly identifies whether the shape is a square or a triangle based on the pattern of '1's in the grid.
