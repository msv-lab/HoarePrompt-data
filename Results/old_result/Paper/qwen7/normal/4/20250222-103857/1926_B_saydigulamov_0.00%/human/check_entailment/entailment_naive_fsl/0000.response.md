Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Let's analyze why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid and then reads the grid itself.
3. It counts the number of '1's in each row and stores these counts in the list `k`.
4. It then checks if the first two counts in `k` are equal, and if so, prints them.

However, this logic is insufficient to determine if the grid contains a triangle or a square. Here are some issues:

- The program does not check if the '1's form a continuous shape.
- It only checks if the first two counts are equal, which is not sufficient to determine the shape.
- It does not handle the specific patterns required for a triangle or a square.

For example, consider the following grid:
```
00000
00000
00110
00110
00000
```
This grid contains a square, but the program would not correctly identify it because the counts of '1's in the rows do not match the pattern required for a square.

Another example:
```
00000
00000
00110
00110
01111
```
This grid contains a triangle, but the program would not correctly identify it because the counts of '1's in the rows do not match the pattern required for a triangle.

Therefore, the program fails to correctly identify the shapes in the grid, making it incorrect.
