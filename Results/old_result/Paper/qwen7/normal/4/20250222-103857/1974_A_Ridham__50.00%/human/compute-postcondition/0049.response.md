Output State: **`total_space` is now `space_y + space_x`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 2, `result` is a list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is calculated based on `y`, `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `total_space` to be the sum of `space_y` and `space_x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
