Output State: **`total_space` is `space_y + space_x`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`**.

Explanation: The code `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` assigns the value of `y` divided by 2 (integer division) to the variable `screen_require_for_y`. Since the initial value of `y` is even, `y // 2` will be an integer. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
