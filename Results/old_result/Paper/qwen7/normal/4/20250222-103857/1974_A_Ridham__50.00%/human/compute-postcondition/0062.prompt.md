Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `result` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    space_x = x * 1
    space_y = y * 4
    total_space = space_y + space_x
    if y % 2 == 0:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2
    else:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
    remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
    if space_x <= remaining_cells:
        result.append(screen_require_for_y)
    else:
        extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
        if space_x % 15 == 0:
            extra_screen = space_x // 15
        else:
            extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
        result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total_space` is `space_y + space_x`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is a list. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` contains `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is either `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is divisible by 15, or `space_x // 15 + 1` otherwise. `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`; if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`; `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `total_space` is `y * 8 + x`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `result` is a list. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` contains `screen_require_for_y` and an additional element `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is either `space_x - remaining_cells` or `(space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1` depending on whether `space_x % 15 == 0` is true or false. `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`, otherwise `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`, `space_y` is updated to `y * 4`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `remaining_cells`, `total_space`, `t`, `n`, `result`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `screen_require_for_y`, `extra_space`, and `extra_screen` remain as defined in the precondition. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, then `result` is a list containing `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing an additional element which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
