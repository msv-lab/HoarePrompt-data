Postcondition: **`total_space` is `y * 8 + x`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `result` is a list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`, otherwise `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `space_y` is updated to `y * 4`**.

This postcondition describes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block. It indicates that regardless of whether the condition `y % 2 == 0` is true or false, `space_y` is always updated to `y * 4`. Additionally, it specifies the relationships between `total_space`, `t`, `n`, `result`, `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `screen_require_for_y`, and `remaining_cells` based on the parity of `y`.
