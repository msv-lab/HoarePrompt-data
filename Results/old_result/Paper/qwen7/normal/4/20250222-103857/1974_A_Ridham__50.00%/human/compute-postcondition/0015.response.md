Output State: **`total_space` is `space_y + space_x`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is a list containing `screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, and `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`.**

Explanation: The code appends `screen_require_for_y` to the list `result`. Since `screen_require_for_y` is defined based on `y`, the value of `screen_require_for_y` remains unchanged, and it is now part of the list `result`. All other variables remain in their original state as no changes were made to them in the given code snippet.
