Output State: **`total_space` is `space_y + space_x`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`; if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `remaining_cells` based on the value of `screen_require_for_y` and `space_y`. The value of `total_space`, `t`, `n`, `result`, `x`, `y`, `space_x`, and `screen_require_for_y` remain unchanged from their initial states. `remaining_cells` is computed as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
