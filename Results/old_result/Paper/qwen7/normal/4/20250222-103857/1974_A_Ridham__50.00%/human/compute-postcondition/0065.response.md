Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes test cases where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For each test case, it processes pairs of integers `x` and `y` where both are between 0 and 99, and returns a result based on these values.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases defined by the integer `t`, and for each test case, it takes two integers `x` and `y` as inputs (though these are not passed directly to the function), and returns some result based on the values of `x` and `y`.
