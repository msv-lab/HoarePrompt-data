Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads two integers from the input, splits them using `split()`, and converts each to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. These two integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `result` remains an empty list.
