Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `_` (which is a placeholder indicating that the loop variable is not used), `n`, and `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total_space` is `space_y + space_x`
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `result` is a list
   - If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` contains `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is either `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is divisible by 15, or `space_x // 15 + 1` otherwise.
   - `x` is an input integer
   - `y` is an input integer
   - `space_x` is equal to `x`
   - `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`
   - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`; if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`
   - `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop head does not use any variables other than the loop counter `_`, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be decremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `total_space` remains the same: `space_y + space_x`
- `t` remains the same: an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is decreased by 1: `n` must be greater than 0 (i.e., `n - 1 > 0`)
- `result` remains the same: a list
- `x` remains the same: an input integer
- `y` remains the same: an input integer
- `space_x` remains the same: equal to `x`
- `space_y` remains the same: equal to `y * 4`
- `screen_require_for_y` remains the same based on the value of `y`
- `remaining_cells` remains the same: `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`

So, the final state for the next iteration is:
State: **`total_space` is `space_y + space_x`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `result` is a list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`; if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`; `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`**
