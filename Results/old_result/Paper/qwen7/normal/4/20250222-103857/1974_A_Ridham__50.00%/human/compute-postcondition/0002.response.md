State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list**.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder) and `n`. The variable `_` is typically used as a dummy variable and does not affect the loop's execution condition directly. Therefore, we focus on `n`.

2. **Determine Execution Condition**: The loop `for _ in range(n):` will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute at all.

3. **Adjust States**: Given the initial state where `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) and `result` is an empty list, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

4. **Final State**: The state should reflect that `t` remains within its original range, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, and `result` remains an empty list since it is not modified by the loop initialization.

Thus, the final state is: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list**.
