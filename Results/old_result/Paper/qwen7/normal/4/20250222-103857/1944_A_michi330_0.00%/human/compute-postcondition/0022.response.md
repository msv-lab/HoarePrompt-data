Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). It checks if \( k \) can be formed by choosing \( k \) pairs from \( n \) elements. If \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n - 1 \), it prints 1, indicating that such a selection is possible. Otherwise, it prints \( n - 1 \), indicating that the input is invalid or such a selection is not possible. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.**
