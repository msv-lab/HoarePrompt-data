Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `i` is `i + 1`, but since `i` is not defined in the initial state, it's not clear what `i` is initially. However, this expression does not affect the `print` statement directly.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.

The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer 1.

Output: **1**
