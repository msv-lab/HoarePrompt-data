You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)
        
    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations. The variable `t` retains its initial value, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. The variable `i` is now equal to `t`, indicating that all iterations have been completed. The variables `n` and `k` retain their last input values from the third iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). It checks if \( k \) can be formed by choosing \( k \) pairs from \( n \) elements. If \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n - 1 \), it prints 1, indicating that such a selection is possible. Otherwise, it prints \( n - 1 \), indicating that the input is invalid or such a selection is not possible. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after Dominater destroys at most `k` bridges.
   - Everule starts from island 1 and can move through bridges.
   - Dominater's goal is to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of islands) and `k` (maximum bridges Dominater can destroy).
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, the program prints `1`. Otherwise, it prints `n-1`.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - If `k >= n-1`:
     - This means Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate island 1 from all other islands. Thus, Everule can only visit island 1.
     - The program correctly prints `1` in this case.
   - If `k < n-1`:
     - Even with the destruction of up to `k` bridges, island 1 can still be connected to at least one other island because `n-1` bridges are needed to fully disconnect island 1.
     - Therefore, Everule can visit at least 2 islands (island 1 and at least one other).
     - The program incorrectly prints `n-1` instead of ensuring that Everule can visit at least 2 islands.

4. **Example Cases:**
   - For the test case `2 1`: 
     - `k = 1` and `n-1 = 1`, so the program prints `1`, which is incorrect. Everule should be able to visit at least 2 islands.
   - For the test case `4 1`:
     - `k = 1` and `n-1 = 3`, so the program prints `3`, which is incorrect. Everule should be able to visit at least 2 islands.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle the cases where `k < n-1`. It should ensure that Everule can visit at least 2 islands when `k < n-1`.

### Correctness:
**False**
