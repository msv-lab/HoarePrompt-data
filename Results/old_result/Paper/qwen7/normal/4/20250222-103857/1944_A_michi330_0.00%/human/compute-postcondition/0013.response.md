Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer from the input.
- `k` is an integer from the input.
- `i` is `i + 1` if `i < t - 1`.

The print statement is `print(n - 1)`. 

To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the value of `n` since it is directly used in the print statement. The value of `n` is an integer from the input, but the exact value is not specified. Therefore, we will denote it as `n`.

Output: **n - 1**
