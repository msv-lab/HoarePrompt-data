Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them by whitespace, and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The initial state of `t` and `i` remains unchanged except that `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `i` is now `i + 1`, and `n` and `k` are the respective integers from the input.
