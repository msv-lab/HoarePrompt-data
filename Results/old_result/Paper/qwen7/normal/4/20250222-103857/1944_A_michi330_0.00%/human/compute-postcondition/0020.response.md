Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations. The variable `t` retains its initial value, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. The variable `i` is now equal to `t`, indicating that all iterations have been completed. The variables `n` and `k` retain their last input values from the third iteration of the loop.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` remains unchanged, `i` equals `t`, and `n` and `k` hold the values provided as input during the last iteration of the loop.
