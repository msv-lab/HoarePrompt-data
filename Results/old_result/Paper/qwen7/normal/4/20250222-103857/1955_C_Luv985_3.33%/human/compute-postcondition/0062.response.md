Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` must be 1, `r` must be `n - 2`, `ans` is either 1 or 2 with a possible increment of 1, `mi` is now `min(a[l], a[r])`, `t` is `k % 2`, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`**.

Explanation: The code `k -= mi * 2` decreases the value of `k` by `2 * mi`. Here, `mi` is defined as `min(a[l], a[r])`, so `k` is decreased by `2 * min(a[l], a[r])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
