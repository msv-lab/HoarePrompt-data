Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is decremented by 1, `ans` is 0, `t` holds the value of `k % 2` at the last iteration, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, the list `a` is now a list of integers, and `k` is converted to an integer.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is decremented by 1, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` holds the value of `k % 2` at the last iteration, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, the list `a` is now a list of integers where `a[r]` (either `a[n-2]` or `a[n-1]`) is updated based on the condition, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `k` is reduced by `mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `k` remains unchanged and is greater than 0, and the final value of `a[r]` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `T` is decremented by 1, `ans` can be 2, 3, or 4, `t` holds the value of `k % 2` at the last iteration, `l` can be 0 or 1, `r` can be `n - 2` or `n - 1`, the list `a` is updated such that `a[0]` is 0 and `a[n-1]` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `k` is decremented by either 0 or `0 * 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `T` is decremented by 1, `ans` is either 3 or 4, `t` holds the value of `k % 2` at the last iteration, `l` is either 0 and `r` is `n - 2` or `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 3`, `k` is decreased by `mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`, the list `a` is updated such that `a[0]` is 0 and `a[n-1]` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
