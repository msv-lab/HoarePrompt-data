Postcondition: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `a` is a list of integers converted from the strings in the original list, `l` is `l + 1`, if `a[r]` is not 0, then `r` is `r - 1`, `ans` is `4`, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `t` is `k % 2`, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**
