Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer converted from the input string, `k` is an integer converted from the input string, `a` is a list of strings split from the input string.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns it to `a`. The values of `T` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `k` also remains unchanged.
