Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is a string from the input, `k` is a string from the input**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two strings and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The value of `T` is updated to `T - 1` before the code is executed, so it remains `T - 1`. The values of `n` and `k` are set to the respective parts of the input string.
