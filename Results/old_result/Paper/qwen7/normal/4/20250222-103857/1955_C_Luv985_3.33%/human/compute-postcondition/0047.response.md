Postcondition: **`T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `mi` is now `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, `ans` is `ans + 1`**.

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `T` remains an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` remains greater than 1, `k` is adjusted by subtracting \(2 \times mi\), `a` is a list of integers where the elements at indices `l` and `r` are each reduced by `mi`, `l` is set to 1, `r` is set to `n - 1`, `ans` is either 1 or 2 and is incremented by 1.
