Postcondition: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is adjusted according to the condition (either `k` is reduced by `mi * 2` or remains unchanged), `a` is a list of integers converted from the strings in the original list, `l` is incremented by 1 unless `a[r]` is 0, in which case `r` is decremented by 1, `ans` is either `4` or `2`, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, and `t` is `k % 2`.**
