Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` is a string, `k` is a string**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two parts, assigning the first part to `n` and the second part to `k`. The value of `T` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, `T` is still an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), while `n` and `k` are now strings containing the respective parts of the input.
