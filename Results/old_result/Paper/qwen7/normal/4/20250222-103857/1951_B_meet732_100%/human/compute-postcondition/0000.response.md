Output State: **a is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and 1 <= k <= n; x is the k-th element of the list a.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the k-th element of the list `a` to the variable `x`. The initial state of `a` and the condition `1 <= k <= n` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is now the value of the k-th element of the list `a`.
