Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `a[0]` is greater than `x`; `ind` is a list containing 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 0) to the list `ind`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 0, `n` must still be greater than 0, `a[0]` is still greater than `x`, and `ind` now contains the element 0.
