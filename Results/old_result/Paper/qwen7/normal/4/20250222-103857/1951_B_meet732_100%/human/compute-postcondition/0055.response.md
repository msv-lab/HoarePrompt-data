Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of n distinct integers. Depending on the internal logic, it returns either n-1, k-1, a value 1 less than the first element of the list `ind`, the maximum value between k-0 and 0-1, the minimum value between ind[1]-1 and k-1, the maximum value between ind[0]-1 and ind[1]-ind[0], or the maximum value between (ind[0]-1) and (k-ind[0]), where `n` is the length of the list `a`, `k` is an unspecified value within the range [1, n], and `ind` is a list containing at least two elements.**

This means the function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of distinct integers. Based on the internal logic involving `n`, `k`, and `ind`, it returns different values as specified in the cases.
