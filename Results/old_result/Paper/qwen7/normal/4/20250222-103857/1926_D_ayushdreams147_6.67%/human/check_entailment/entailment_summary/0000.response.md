Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the logic used in the `func_1` function aligns with the problem requirements. Specifically, we need to ensure that the transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` correctly ensures that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits from the 1st to the 31st bit.

### Analysis of the Transformation:
- The expression `1 << 31` shifts 1 to the left by 31 positions, resulting in a number with only the 32nd bit set to 1.
- Subtracting 1 from this value results in a number with the 31 least significant bits set to 1 (`111...111`).
- XORing a number with this value flips all the bits of the original number.

### Effect of the Transformation:
- If two numbers `x` and `y` have different bits in the 1st to 31st positions, their transformed values will also differ in at least one bit position.
- Therefore, transforming each number using `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` ensures that numbers with differing bits in the 1st to 31st positions will map to different values, making them distinct in the transformed list.

### Counting Unique Elements:
- The code uses a dictionary `count` to keep track of the occurrences of transformed values.
- If a transformed value is encountered for the first time, it increments the result counter `res`.
- If a transformed value is already present, it decrements the count (though this decrement is not necessary since we are only interested in the number of unique values).

### Conclusion:
The transformation and counting logic in the `func_1` function correctly determines the minimum number of groups required to satisfy the condition. Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
