Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `num` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. The variable `num` takes on the value of each element in `a` during each iteration.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is a non-empty list, and `num` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - For the next iteration, `num` will be the second element of the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `num` is the second element of the list `a`, we need to update `num` to reflect this new value.
   - The list `a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, but now `num` will refer to the second element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `a` is a non-empty list, `num` is the second element of the list `a`.**
