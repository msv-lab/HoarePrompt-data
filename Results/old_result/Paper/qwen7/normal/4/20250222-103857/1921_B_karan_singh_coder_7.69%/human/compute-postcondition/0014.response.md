Postcondition: **`cnt` will be the total count of positions where the characters in string `s` do not match the corresponding characters in string `t`. `t1` remains the number of '1' characters in the string `s`, `t` is the input integer, `n` is the input integer, and `s` is the string input by the user. The variable `i` will be `n` after the loop completes. The current value of `s1` is equal to `t1`.**
