Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `cnt` will be the total count of positions where the characters in string `s` do not match the corresponding characters in string `t`. `t1` remains the number of '1' characters in the string `s`, `t` is the input integer, `n` is the input integer, and `s` is the string input by the user. The variable `i` will be `n` after the loop completes.**

This means that `cnt` will hold the final count of mismatches between `s` and `t` across all indices from 0 to `n-1`. The other variables (`t1`, `t`, `n`, `s`) retain their original or unchanged values, and `i` will have exceeded `n-1` by the end of the loop, effectively indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
