Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cnt` is the total count of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` differ, `s1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `s`, `t1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `t`, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, `s` is a newly input string.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` reads a new string from the input and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `n`, `cnt`, `s1`, `t1`, and `d` remain unchanged from their initial states. The newly input string is now stored in `s`.
