Postcondition: **`cnt` is the total count of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` differ, `s1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `s`, `t1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `t`. If `s1` equals `t1`, `cnt` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cnt` is updated based on the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, and `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.**
