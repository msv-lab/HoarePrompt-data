To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the expression in the `print` statement step by step.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cnt`: Total count of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` differ.
   - `s1`: Count of '1' characters in the string `s`.
   - `t1`: Count of '1' characters in the string `t`.
   - `s`: Newly input string.
   - `t`: Newly input string.
   - `i`: 4 (though `i` is not used in the expression).
   - `d`: Absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.

2. **Expression in the `print` Statement:**
   \[
   \text{print}((\text{cnt} - \text{d}) // 2 + \text{d})
   \]

3. **Breaking Down the Expression:**
   - \(\text{d} = |\text{s1} - \text{t1}|\): This is the absolute difference between the counts of '1' characters in `s` and `t`.
   - \((\text{cnt} - \text{d}) // 2 + \text{d}\): This expression can be broken into two parts:
     - \((\text{cnt} - \text{d}) // 2\): This part divides the difference between `cnt` and `d` by 2, performing integer division.
     - Adding \(\text{d}\) back to the result of the division: This ensures that the final result is adjusted by the absolute difference `d`.

4. **Understanding the Result:**
   - If `cnt` is greater than `d`, then \((\text{cnt} - \text{d}) // 2\) will be an integer, and adding `d` back will adjust the result.
   - If `cnt` is less than `d`, the expression will still yield a valid integer after the addition of `d`.

Given the above breakdown, the expression \((\text{cnt} - \text{d}) // 2 + \text{d}\) simplifies to \(\text{cnt}\), because the subtraction and addition of `d` cancel out the effect of the integer division.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the value of `cnt`.

Output: **cnt**
