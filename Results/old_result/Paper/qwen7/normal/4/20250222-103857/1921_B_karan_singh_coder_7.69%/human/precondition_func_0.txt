t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains a positive integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; the second and third lines are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters representing the initial and final states of the boxes, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
