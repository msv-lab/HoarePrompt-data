Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The program attempts to sort the array and then join the elements as strings, which does not achieve the goal of maximizing the beauty of the array.

To maximize the beauty of the array, we need to arrange the elements such that the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) are maximized. Sorting the array and simply joining the elements as strings does not ensure this arrangement. For example, consider the input:

```
3
100 54 80
```

The correct approach would be to arrange the elements in a way that maximizes the differences. One optimal arrangement could be `[54, 80, 100]`, which gives a beauty of \( (80 - 54) + (100 - 80) = 26 \).

However, the provided program will simply sort the array and join the elements as strings, resulting in `['54', '80', '100']` which is not a valid integer array and does not provide the correct beauty value.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
