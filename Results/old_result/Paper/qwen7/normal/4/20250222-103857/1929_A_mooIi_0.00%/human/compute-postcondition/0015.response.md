Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 500) indicating the number of subsequent test cases, followed by an integer \( n \) (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 100) and a list of \( n \) integers (1 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it reads the integers, sorts them, and prints the sorted integers as a space-separated string. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.**
