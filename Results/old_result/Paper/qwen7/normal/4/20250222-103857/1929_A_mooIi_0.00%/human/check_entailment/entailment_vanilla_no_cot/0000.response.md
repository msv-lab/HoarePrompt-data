Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to sort the array and then join the elements into a string, which is not what the problem requires. The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The current implementation does not achieve this.

To solve the problem correctly, you should rearrange the elements to maximize the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. One effective strategy is to place the smallest element at one end and the largest at the other, alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements. This ensures that the differences are maximized.
