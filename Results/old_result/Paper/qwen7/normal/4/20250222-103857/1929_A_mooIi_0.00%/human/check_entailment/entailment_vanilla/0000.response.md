Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements.

2. **Sorting and Rearranging**:
   - The program sorts the array elements but converts them to strings before joining them back into a single string.
   - It then prints the sorted array elements joined with spaces.

### Problem Description Recap:
- The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.
- To maximize this sum, we should place the smallest element at `a_1` and the largest element at `a_n`, and so on, ensuring the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

### Issues in the Given Program:
1. **Incorrect Rearrangement**:
   - The program sorts the array but does not rearrange the elements to maximize the beauty. Instead, it simply prints the sorted array as a string.
   - Sorting the array does not necessarily maximize the beauty because the relative positions of elements matter.

2. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs the sorted array as a string, which is not what the problem requires. The problem asks for the maximum beauty value, not the sorted array.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: Input `[2, 1, 3]`
  - Correct rearrangement would be `[1, 3, 2]` to maximize beauty.
  - Beauty = `(3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = 2 - 1 = 1`.
  - The program outputs the sorted array as a string: `"1 2 3"`.

- **Test Case 2**: Input `[69, 69, 69]`
  - The array is already sorted, and rearranging doesn't change the beauty.
  - Beauty = `0`.
  - The program outputs the sorted array as a string: `"69 69 69"`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not rearrange the array to maximize the beauty and instead outputs the sorted array as a string, which is not the required format.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
