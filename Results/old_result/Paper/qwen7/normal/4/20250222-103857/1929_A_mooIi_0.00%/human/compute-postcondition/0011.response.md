Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input.

The `print(' '.join(ar))` statement will join all the elements in the list `ar` with a space character as a separator and then print the resulting string.

Since `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers, the output will be a single line of text where each integer is separated by a space.

Output: **a single line of space-separated integers (where the integers are the sorted values from the input)**
