Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(' '.join(ar))
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `ar` is a list of strings where each string represents an integer from the input, and these strings are already sorted.
2. The `join` method is used to concatenate the elements of the list `ar` with a space (' ') as the separator.
3. The resulting string is then printed.

Given that `ar` contains the sorted integers as strings, the `print` statement will output these integers separated by spaces.

Output: **a space-separated string of the sorted integers from the input**
