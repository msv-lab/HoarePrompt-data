Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, sorts the integers, and then maps each integer to a string. The resulting list of strings is stored in `ar`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
