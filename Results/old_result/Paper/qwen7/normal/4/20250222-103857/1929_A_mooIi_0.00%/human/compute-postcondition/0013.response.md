Output State: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be the total number of test cases processed, with each test case having its own `n` (number of integers) and `ar` (sorted list of those integers).
