Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `m` retains the value it had after the first input.
- `i` is equal to `n + 1`.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements.
- `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of each element in list `a`.
- `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of the second element in list `a` repeated `n-1` times, followed by the last character of the last element in list `a`.
- The first element of the list `a` is not a single character repeated throughout.
- The first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`.
- The length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1.
- `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`.

Given these conditions, the `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
