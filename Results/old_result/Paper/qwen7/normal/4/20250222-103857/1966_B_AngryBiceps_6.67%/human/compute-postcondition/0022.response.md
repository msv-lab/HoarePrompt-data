Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is equal to the number of times the loop has executed, `i` is \(n-1\), `m` is an integer obtained from the second input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each being the input provided in each iteration), `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of each element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last character of each element in the list `a` concatenated together. Additionally, the first element of `a` is not composed of a single unique character or the first and last elements of `a` are the same.
