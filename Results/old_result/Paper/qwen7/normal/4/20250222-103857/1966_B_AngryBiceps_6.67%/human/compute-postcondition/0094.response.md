Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `m` retains the value it had after the first input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being an input provided during the loop's iterations), `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of each element in list `a`, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of the second element in list `a` repeated `n-1` times, followed by the last character of the last element in list `a`. The conditions specified in the if part hold if either the first string in the list `a` consists of the same character repeated and is different from the last string in the list `a`, or the first string in the list `a` does not consist of a single character repeated and is not equal to the last string. Otherwise, the conditions specified in the else part hold.**

This output state describes the final state after the loop has completed all its iterations. The variables `t`, `m`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` reflect the final values after processing all inputs. The conditions for printing "NO" or "YES" are evaluated based on the final state of these variables.
