Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the allowed operations. Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **First and Last Row Check**: The code checks if the first row and the last row are different but have the same color. This is not sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform. It only checks two specific rows and does not consider other rows or columns.

2. **Uniformity Check**: The code assumes that if the first and last rows are different but have the same color, then it's impossible to make the whole grid uniform. However, this is not always true. The operations allow changing the colors of subrectangles, which means that even if the first and last rows differ, it might still be possible to make the whole grid uniform through a series of operations.

3. **General Case Handling**: The code does not handle general cases where the grid can be made uniform. For example, if the grid has alternating rows or columns, it should still be possible to make the whole grid uniform.

### Correct Solution Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to check if the entire grid can be made uniform by considering the following:
- If there exists a column or row where all cells are the same color, then the grid can be made uniform.
- Otherwise, if there is no such column or row, then the grid cannot be made uniform because the operations only allow changing subrectangles, and there would be no way to unify the colors across the entire grid.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check if any row or column is uniform
        for i in range(n):
            if len(set(a[i])) == 1:
                print('YES')
                break
        else:
            for j in range(m):
                col = ''.join([a[i][j] for i in range(n)])
                if len(set(col)) == 1:
                    print('YES')
                    break
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This solution correctly checks if any row or column is uniform, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for making the entire grid uniform.
