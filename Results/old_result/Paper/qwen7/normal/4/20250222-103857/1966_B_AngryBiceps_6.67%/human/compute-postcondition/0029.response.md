Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the number of times the loop has executed.
- `i` is \(n-1\).
- `m` is an integer obtained from the second input.
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, where each element is an input provided in each iteration.
- `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of each element in the list `a`.
- `last_row` is the last character of each element in the list `a` concatenated together.
- Either the first character of all elements in `a` is not the same, or the first character of all elements in `a` is the same and the first character is also the last character of all elements in `a`.
- The length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not equal to 1 or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Given this, the output of the print statement will be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
