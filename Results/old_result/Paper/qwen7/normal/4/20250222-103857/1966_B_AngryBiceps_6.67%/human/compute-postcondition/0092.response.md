Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` retains the value it had after the first input, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being an input provided during the loop's iterations), `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of each element in list `a`, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of the second element in list `a` repeated `n-1` times, followed by the last character of the last element in list `a`. Additionally, the first element of list `a` either consists of the same character repeated and is different from the last element, or the first element does not consist of a single character repeated and is not equal to the last element.**
