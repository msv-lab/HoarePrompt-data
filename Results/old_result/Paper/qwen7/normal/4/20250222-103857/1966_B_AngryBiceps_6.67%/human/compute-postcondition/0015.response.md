Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input, `a` is a list containing three elements (the original two elements and the newly appended input), `first_row` is the concatenation of its original value and the first character of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a` plus the last character of the last element in the list `a`, `first_row` is updated to include the first character of the last element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to `first_row`. Since `a` is a list containing three elements, `a[-1]` refers to the last element of the list, and `[0]` refers to the first character of that element. The other variables remain unchanged.
