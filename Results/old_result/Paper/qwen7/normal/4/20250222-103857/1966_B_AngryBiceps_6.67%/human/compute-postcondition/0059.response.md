Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `m` is the integer obtained from the third input.
- `i` is equal to `n`, which is the total number of iterations.
- `n` is the count of how many times the loop ran.
- `a` contains all the input strings provided during the loop.
- `first_row` is constructed by taking the first character of each string in the list `a`.
- `last_row` is constructed by taking the last character of each string in the list `a`.
- The first string in the list `a` either consists of a single unique character or is the same as the last string in the list `a`.

The `print('YES')` statement simply outputs the string "YES".

Output: **YES**
