Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` provides a positive integer value.
   - The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop condition directly.
   - The loop condition depends on the input provided by `int(input())`.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - The initial state before the loop is given as `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop will run for each positive integer input up to \(10^4\), the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that the input will provide a valid positive integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input provided by `int(input())` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
