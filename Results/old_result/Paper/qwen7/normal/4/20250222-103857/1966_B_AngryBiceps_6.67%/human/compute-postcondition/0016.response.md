Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input, `a` is a list containing three elements (the original two elements and the newly appended input), `first_row` is the concatenation of its original value and the first character of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a` repeated twice, `last_row` is updated to include the last character of the last element in the list `a` again.**

Explanation: The code appends the last character of the last element in the list `a` to `last_row`. Since `last_row` was previously the last character of the last element in the list `a` repeated twice, appending the last character again means `last_row` now contains the last character of the last element in the list `a` three times.
