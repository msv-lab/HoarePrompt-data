The code appends the last character of the last element in the list `a` to the `last_row` variable. Initially, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a`. After executing the line `last_row += a[-1][-1]`, `last_row` will have its original value plus the last character of the last element in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input, `a` is a list containing two elements (the original element and the newly appended input), `first_row` is the concatenation of its original value and the first character of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a` plus the last character of the last element in the list `a`.**
