Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `m` retains the value it had after the first input.
   - `i` is equal to `n + 1`.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `a` is a list containing one element which is the input provided.
   - `first_row` is the last character of the only element in list `a`.
   - `last_row` is equal to the last character of the only element in list `a`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n + 1`, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. This means `i` needs to be decreased by 1 to become `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to `n`.

5. **Maintain other states**:
   - `m`, `n`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

So, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` retains the value it had after the first input, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input provided, `first_row` is the last character of the only element in list `a`, `last_row` is equal to the last character of the only element in list `a`**.
