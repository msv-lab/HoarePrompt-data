Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `m` is the integer obtained from the third input.
   - `i` is the new value of `n`.
   - `a` is a list containing one element which is the input string from the user.
   - `first_row` is the first character of the last element in the list `a`.
   - `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the new value of `n`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is the new value of `n`, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `t` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `m` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (since `i` is the new value of `n` and `n` must be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute again).
- `n` is incremented by 1.
- `a` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `first_row` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `last_row` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` is the integer obtained from the third input, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is `n + 1`, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input string from the user, `first_row` is the first character of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a`**.
