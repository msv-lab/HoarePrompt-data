Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of n and m, both positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and a grid of size n × m filled with characters 'W' and 'B'. The sum of n·m over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = []
    first_row = ''
    last_row = ''
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(input())
        first_row += a[-1][0]
        last_row += a[-1][-1]
    if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        print('NO')
    elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is equal to the number of times the loop has executed, `i` is \(n-1\), `m` is an integer obtained from the second input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each being the input provided in each iteration), `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of each element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last character of each element in the list `a` concatenated together. The condition is met if either the first character of all elements in `a` is not the same, or the first character of all elements in `a` is the same and the first character is different from the last character of all elements in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` retains the value it had after the first input, `i` is equal to `n` (which is the total number of iterations), `n` is the count of how many times the loop ran, `a` contains all the input strings provided during the loop, `first_row` is constructed by taking the first character of each string in the list `a`, and `last_row` is constructed by taking the last character of each string in the list `a`. Additionally, if the first string in the list `a` consists of the same character repeated and the first string is different from the last string in the list `a`, then the first string in the list `a` consists of the same character repeated and the first string is different from the last string in the list `a`. Otherwise, `m` is the integer obtained from the third input, and if the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1 and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, then the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, the conditions specified in the else part hold.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` retains the value it had after the first input, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being an input provided during the loop's iterations), `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of each element in list `a`, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of the second element in list `a` repeated `n-1` times, followed by the last character of the last element in list `a`. Additionally, the first element of list `a` either consists of the same character repeated and is different from the last element, or the first element does not consist of a single character repeated and is not equal to the last element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
