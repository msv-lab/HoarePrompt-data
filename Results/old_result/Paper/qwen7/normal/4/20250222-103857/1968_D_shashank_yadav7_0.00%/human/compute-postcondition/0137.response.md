Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n):` statement. The only variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 8.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: Given that `i` was 8 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 9 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Keep other variables unchanged**: The other variables (`k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, and `n`) are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is 9, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`, `n` is `n`**
