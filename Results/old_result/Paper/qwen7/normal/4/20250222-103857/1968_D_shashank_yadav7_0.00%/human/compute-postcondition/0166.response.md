Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 14
- `k` is -3
- `b` is `p[b] - 3`, but since `p` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `b`. However, it is derived from the value of `p` at the index `b` minus 3.
- `s` is `p[s] - 3`, similarly, we cannot determine the exact value of `s` without knowing the value of `p` at the index `s` minus 3.
- `bm` is `2 * bm + max(2 * bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, but since `bm` is not initially defined, we assume it starts at 0 for the purpose of this calculation. This means `bm` will be updated based on the formula, but we cannot determine its exact value without further context.
- `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, again, `sm` is not initially defined, so we assume it starts at 0. This means `sm` will be updated based on the formula, but we cannot determine its exact value without further context.
- `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + sp + a[s] + a[s]`, assuming `sp` starts at 0, this simplifies to `sp = 4 * a[s]`.
- `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + bp + a[b] + a[b]`, assuming `bp` starts at 0, this simplifies to `bp = 4 * a[b]`.

Given these conditions, the print statement is simply printing a string.
