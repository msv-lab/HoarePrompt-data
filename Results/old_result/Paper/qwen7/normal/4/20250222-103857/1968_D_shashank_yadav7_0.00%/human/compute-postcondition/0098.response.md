Output State: **`i` is 5, `k` is 4, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm` by adding the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`. The values of `i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, and `bp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
