Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are integers obtained from the input split.**

The code `n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads four integers from the input and splits them into a list, which is then unpacked into the variables `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`. The initial conditions for `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
