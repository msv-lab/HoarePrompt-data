Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 7
- `k` is -2
- `b` is `p[b] - 1`
- `s` is `p[s] - 1`
- `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`
- `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`
- `sp` is `a[s] + sp`
- `bp` is `a[b] + bp`

The print statement is `print('Draw')`.

The value printed is explicitly stated within the print statement itself, and no calculation or evaluation of variables is needed for this particular print statement.

Output: **Draw**
