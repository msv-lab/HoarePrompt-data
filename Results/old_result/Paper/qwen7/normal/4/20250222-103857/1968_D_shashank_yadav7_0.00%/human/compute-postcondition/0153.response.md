Output State: **`i` is 10, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1 - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1 - 1`, `bm` is `2 * bm`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + bp`**.

The code `b = p[b] - 1` updates the value of `b` to `p[b] - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Note that `b` is updated, but its new value is expressed in terms of `p[b]` as per the initial state definition.
