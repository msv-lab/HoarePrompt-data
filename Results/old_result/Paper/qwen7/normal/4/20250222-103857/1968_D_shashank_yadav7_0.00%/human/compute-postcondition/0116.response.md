Output State: **`i` is 8, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `bm` is at least as large as `sm`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp**.

Explanation: The code reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`. The values of `i`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, `p[b]`, and `p[s]` remain unchanged. The new values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are dependent on the input provided by the user.
