Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 3
- `k` is 0
- `b` is `p[b] - 1`
- `s` is `p[s] - 1`
- `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`
- `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`
- `sp` is `a[s] + sp`
- `bp` is `a[b] + bp`

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - Therefore, `i` must be 4.

2. **Variables `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp`:**
   - These variables are not directly affected by the loop condition (`i < n`).
   - They remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

### Updated States:
- `i` must be 4.
- `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 4, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`**
