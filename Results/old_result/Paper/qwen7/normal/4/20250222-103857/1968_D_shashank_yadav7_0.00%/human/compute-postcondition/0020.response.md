Output State: **`bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `i` is -1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` equals 0, `s` is `p[s]` - 1.**

Explanation: The variable `bm` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value (`bm`) and the expression `a[b] * k + bp`. Since `k` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a[b] * 0 + bp`, which is just `bp`. Therefore, `bm` is updated to be `max(bm, bp)`. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged.
