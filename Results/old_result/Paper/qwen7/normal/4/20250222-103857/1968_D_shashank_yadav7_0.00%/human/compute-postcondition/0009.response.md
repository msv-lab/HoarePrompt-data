Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is -2, `sp` is the element at index `s` in list `a`, `bp` is the element at index `b` in list `a`, `bm` is the element at index `b` in list `a` multiplied by `k`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[b] * k` to the variable `bm`. The values of `t`, `i`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
