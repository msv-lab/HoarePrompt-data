Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is -2, `b` is `input integer - 2`, `sp` is the value of `a[2]`, `bp` is `a[input integer - 2]`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `sm` is unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `s` is 2.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[b] * k` to `bm`. Given that `b` is `input integer - 2`, `bm` is updated to the product of the element at index `b` in the list `a` and the value of `k` (-2). All other variables remain unchanged.
