Output State: **`i` is 8, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`**

Explanation: The code `s = p[s] - 1` updates the value of `s` by assigning to it the value of `p[s] - 1`. However, the initial value of `s` is not provided, and it is not clear what `p` is. Since no specific value for `p[s]` is given, we keep it as `p[s] - 1`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `b` remain unchanged.
