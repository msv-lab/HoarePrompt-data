Output State: **`i` is 8, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`**

Explanation: The code `bp += a[b]` increments the value of `bp` by `a[b]`. Since `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `a[b]` is the value at index `p[b] - 1` of the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
