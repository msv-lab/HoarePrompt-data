Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is -2, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `sp` is incremented by the value of `a[s]` three times, `bp` is incremented by the value of `a[b]` three times, `bm` is the maximum of its current value and two calculations involving `a[b]`, `k`, and `bp`, `sm` is the maximum of its current value and two calculations involving `a[s]`, `k`, and `sp`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user and converts them into a list of integers. This affects the variable `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
