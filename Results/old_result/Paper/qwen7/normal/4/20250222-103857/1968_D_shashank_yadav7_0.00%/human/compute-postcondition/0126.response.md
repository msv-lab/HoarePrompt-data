Output State: **`i` is 8, `k` is decreased by 1**

The value of `i` remains unchanged at 8. The value of `k` is decreased by 1, but since `k` was not initialized or given an initial value in the initial state, we can only say that `k` is decreased by 1. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
