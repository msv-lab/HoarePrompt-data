Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `a`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The initial list `p` is described as a list of integers obtained from the input split, and now `a` holds the same list of integers.
