Output State: **All `i` values will be equal to 10000, `k` will be -10000, `b` will be `p[b] - 9999`, `s` will be `p[s] - 9999`, `bm` will be `2^9999 * bm + max(2^9999 * bm, a[b] * -10000 + bp)`, `sm` will be `sm + max(sm, a[s] * -10000 + sp)`, `sp` will be `sum(a[s]) * 9999 + sp`, `bp` will be `sum(a[b]) * 9999 + bp`.**

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop (10000 iterations), the variable `i` will reach the maximum possible value of 10000. The variable `k` will be set to -10000 since it decreases by 1 in each iteration. The variables `b` and `s` will be adjusted by subtracting 9999 from their initial values due to the repeated updates within the loop. The variable `bm` will be updated in each iteration, leading to a very large value due to the exponential growth factor \(2^{9999}\). Similarly, `sm` will also be updated but with a smaller factor compared to `bm`. The variables `sp` and `bp` will accumulate the sum of elements from lists `a` and `b`, respectively, multiplied by the number of iterations (9999 times).
