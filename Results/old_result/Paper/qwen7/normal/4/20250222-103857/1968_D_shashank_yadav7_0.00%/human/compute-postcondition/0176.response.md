Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \(t\), \(n\), \(k\), \(P_B\), and \(P_S\), along with lists \(p\) and \(a\). For each test case, it calculates two scores, \(bm\) and \(sm\), by iterating through the permutation \(p\) and updating the scores based on the values in list \(a\) and the remaining count \(k\). After processing all test cases, it prints 'Bodya' if \(bm\) is greater than \(sm\), 'Sasha' if \(bm\) is less than \(sm\), and 'Draw' if they are equal.**
