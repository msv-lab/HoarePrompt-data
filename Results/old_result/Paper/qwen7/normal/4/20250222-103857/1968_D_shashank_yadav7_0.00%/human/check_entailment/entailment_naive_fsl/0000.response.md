Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where a player might stay at their current position multiple times during a turn. This is a critical aspect of the game rules, as players can choose to stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation.

Consider the following test case:
- `n = 3`, `k = 2`, `P_B = 1`, `P_S = 1`
- Permutation: `[3, 2, 1]`
- Array: `[1, 2, 3]`

In this case:
- Initially, both players are at position 1.
- On the first turn:
  - Bodya's score: `a[1] = 1`
  - Sasha's score: `a[1] = 1`
  - Both players stay at position 1.
- On the second turn:
  - Bodya's score: `1 + a[3] = 1 + 3 = 4`
  - Sasha's score: `1 + a[3] = 1 + 3 = 4`
  - Both players stay at position 1.

Since both players end up with the same score, the result should be "Draw". However, the provided program does not account for the possibility of staying at the same position multiple times, leading to incorrect results in such scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
