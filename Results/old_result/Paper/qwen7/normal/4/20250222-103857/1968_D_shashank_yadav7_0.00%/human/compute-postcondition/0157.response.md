Output State: **`i` is 10, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1 - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `bm` is `2 * bm + max(2 * bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + sp + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + bp`, `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` adds the value of `a[s]` to `sp`. Since `sp` was previously `a[s] + a[s] + sp`, the new value of `sp` becomes `a[s] + a[s] + sp + a[s]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
