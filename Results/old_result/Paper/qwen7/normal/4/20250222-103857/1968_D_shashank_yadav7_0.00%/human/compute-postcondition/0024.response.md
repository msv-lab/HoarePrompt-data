Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sm` is `sm` + max(`sm`, `a[s]` * `k` + `sp`)
   - `i` is -1
   - `bp` is `bp` + `a[b]`
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 0
   - `k` equals 0
   - `s` is `p[s]` - 1
   - `sp` is increased by `a[s]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently -1, and the loop condition is `i < n`, the loop will execute if `i` is incremented to 0 (since `n` is a positive integer).
   - Therefore, `i` will be updated to 0.

5. **Other states remain unchanged**:
   - `sm`, `bp`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `sp` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`sm` is `sm` + max(`sm`, `a[s]` * `k` + `sp`), `i` is 0, `bp` is `bp` + `a[b]`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` equals 0, `s` is `p[s]` - 1, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`**
