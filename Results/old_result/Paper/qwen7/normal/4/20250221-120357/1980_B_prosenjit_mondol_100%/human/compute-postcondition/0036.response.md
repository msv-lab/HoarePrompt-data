Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `f` is the second integer entered by the user minus 1, `k` is the second integer entered by the user minus 3, `a` is a list of three integers sorted in descending order, `x` is a list with three elements converted from input, `x[0]` is the element at index 0 of list `a` at index `f`, `k` is the second integer entered by the user minus 2 minus 1.**

In more detail, the value of `k` is decreased by 1, so `k` is now the second integer entered by the user minus 3 minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
