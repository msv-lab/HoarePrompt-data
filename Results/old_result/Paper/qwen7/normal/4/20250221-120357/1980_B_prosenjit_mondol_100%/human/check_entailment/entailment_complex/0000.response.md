Reasoning:
1. The function correctly processes each test case by reading the necessary inputs and performing the required operations.
2. The function sorts the list `a` in descending order, which is correct according to the problem statement.
3. The function then compares the value of the `k`-th element in the sorted list with the value of the `f`-th element.
4. The logic for determining whether the favorite cube is removed or not is correct:
   - If the `k`-th element is greater than the `f`-th element, the function correctly prints 'NO'.
   - If the `k`-th element is less than the `f`-th element, the function correctly prints 'YES'.
   - If the `k`-th element is equal to the `f`-th element, the function checks additional conditions to determine if the `f`-th element will be removed:
     - If `k` is the last index (`n - 1`), the function prints 'YES'.
     - If the element at `k + 1` is less than the `f`-th element, the function prints 'YES'.
     - Otherwise, the function prints 'MAYBE'.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the function appears to handle all cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
