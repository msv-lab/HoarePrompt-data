Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `f` is 1 less than the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the third integer entered by the user minus 1, `a` is a list containing three integers.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes three integers entered by the user, splits them into a list, and converts each string to an integer. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state, but a new list `a` is created containing these three integers.
