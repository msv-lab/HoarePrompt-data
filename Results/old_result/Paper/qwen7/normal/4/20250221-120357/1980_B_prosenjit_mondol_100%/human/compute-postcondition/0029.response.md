Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is the first integer entered by the user.
- `f` is 2 less than the second integer entered by the user, so if the second integer entered is \(y\), then \(f = y - 2\).
- `k` is the second integer entered by the user minus 2, so \(k = y - 2\), which is the same as \(f\).
- `a` is a list of three integers sorted in descending order.
- `x` is a list with three elements converted from input.
- `x[0]` is the element at index 0 of list `a` at index `f`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. Since no values of the variables are explicitly required to be printed, and the string `'YES'` is directly printed without any variable substitution, the output remains as is.

Output: **YES**
