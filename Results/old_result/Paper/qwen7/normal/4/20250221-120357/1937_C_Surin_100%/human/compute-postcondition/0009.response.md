Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be at least 2; `v2` is 1**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or change their values. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any previously printed output is actually displayed. Since no variables are modified, the initial state remains unchanged.
