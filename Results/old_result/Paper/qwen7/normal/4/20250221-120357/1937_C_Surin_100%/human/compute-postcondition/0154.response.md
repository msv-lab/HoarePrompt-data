Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 5
- `prev` is 4
- `n` must be greater than 4 (though `n` is not used in the print statement)
- `r2` is an input string (but it is not used in the print statement)

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Here, `v1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since `v1` is not mentioned in the initial state and there's no way to infer its value from the given information, we cannot determine its value precisely. Therefore, we will leave `v1` as it is in the output.

Given this, the print statement will output a string with placeholders for `v1`, `i`, and `prev`.

Output: **'? [v1] 5 [v1] 4'**
