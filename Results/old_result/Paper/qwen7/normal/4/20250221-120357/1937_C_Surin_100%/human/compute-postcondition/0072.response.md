Output State: **`i` is `prev + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `r` is an input string, `prev` is equal to the previous value of `i`, `r2` is an input string, `r` is the new input string.**

Explanation: The code `r = input()` assigns the value of the new input to the variable `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
