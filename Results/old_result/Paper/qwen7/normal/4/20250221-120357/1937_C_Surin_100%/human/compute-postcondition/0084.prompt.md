Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be at least 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input()
    if r == '>':
        prev = i
    elif r == '=':
        print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r2 = input('')
        if r2 == '<':
            prev = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is within the range [1, n-1], `n` is at least 2, `r` is an input string. If the current value of `r` is '>', then `prev` is equal to `i`. Otherwise, `r` is set to '=', `r2` is set to the input string with the current value '<', and `prev` is equal to `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is at least 2, `r` is an input string, `prev` is equal to the previous value of `i`, and `r2` is an input string. If `r` equals '>', `i` is further incremented by 1. If `r2` equals '<', no additional change is made to `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `prev + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `r` is an input string, `prev` is now equal to `i`, `r2` is the new input string. If `r` equals '>', then `i` is incremented by 1. If `r2` equals '<', then no change is made to `r` and `i` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
