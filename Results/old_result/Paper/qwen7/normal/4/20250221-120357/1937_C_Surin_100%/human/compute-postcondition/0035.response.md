Output State: **`i` must be within the range [1, n-1], `n` must be at least 2**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `i` or `n`. It is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any print statements before this line are immediately written to the console. However, since no variables are assigned or modified by this line of code, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
