Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `kp` and the input value used to determine the range of `kp`.

2. **Understand the initial conditions**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is at least 2
   - `r` is an input string
   - `v2` is `n-1`
   - `v1` is `n-1`
   - `prev` is 1

3. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop runs for `int(input())` iterations. Since `kp` is the loop variable, it starts from 0 and goes up to `int(input()) - 1`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `kp` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - The input value (`int(input())`) remains the same for each iteration.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `r` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `v2` and `v1` are derived from `n`, and since `n` does not change, `v2` and `v1` remain `n-1`.
   - `prev` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

6. **New state for the next iteration**:
   - `kp` will be 0 (since it starts from 0 and is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration).
   - The input value (`int(input())`) must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again (since `n` is at least 2).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `r` is an input string, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is 1, `kp` is 0, `int(input())` is at least 2**
