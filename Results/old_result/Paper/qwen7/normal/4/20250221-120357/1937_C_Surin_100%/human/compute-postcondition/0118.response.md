Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the range function `range(1, n)` will not produce any values if `n` is less than 1.
   - However, the problem states that `n` must be greater than 2. Therefore, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` is initialized to `n` in the given state, we need to ensure that `i` is set to a value within the range `1` to `n` (inclusive).
   - Given that `n` must be at least 3, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n` to be 3. This means `i` should be set to 3 as well since `i` is initially equal to `n`.

4. **Final Adjusted State:**
   - `i` should be 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 2, and the smallest possible value for `n` is 3.

Therefore, the final state needed for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2**
