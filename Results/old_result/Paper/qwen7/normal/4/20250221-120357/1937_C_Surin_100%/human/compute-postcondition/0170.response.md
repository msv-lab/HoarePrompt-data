Output State: **i is 6, n is greater than 5, and prev is either 5 or 6.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `n`, and `prev`. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any previously printed output is actually displayed. Since no variables are assigned new values or modified, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
