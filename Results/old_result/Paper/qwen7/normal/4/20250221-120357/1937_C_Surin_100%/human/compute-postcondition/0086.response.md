Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `r` is an input string, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is 1**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all previously written output is actually sent to the terminal. Since no variables are modified, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
