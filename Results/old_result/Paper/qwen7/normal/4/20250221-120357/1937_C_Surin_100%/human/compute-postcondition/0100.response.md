Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for i in range(1, n):` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `r` is either the string '<' or no string (if the if part did not execute)
   - `v2` is 1
   - `v1` is 1
   - `prev` is 1
   - `kp` is 0
   - `g` is 0

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 1, the loop will continue as long as `n` is greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is 1, it will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - The values of `r`, `v2`, `v1`, `prev`, `kp`, and `g` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is either the string '<' or no string (if the if part did not execute), `v2` is 1, `v1` is 1, `prev` is 1, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0**.
