Output State: **Postcondition: `i` must be within the range [1, n-1], `n` must be at least 2, `r` is an input string, and the string `r` is equal to '=', and the current value of `r` is '='.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change the values of any variables. It flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console immediately. However, since no variables are assigned or modified, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
