Output State: **`i` is within the range [1, n-1], `n` must be at least 2, `r` is an input string with the current value '=', `r2` is the input string from the user with the current value '<', `prev` is equal to `i`.**

The code `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `prev`. Since `i` is within the range [1, n-1] and `n` is at least 2, `prev` now holds the same value as `i`. The values of `r` and `r2` remain unchanged.
