Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 5.
- `prev` is explicitly given as 4.
- `n` must be greater than 4, but this variable is not used in the print statement.
- `r` is an input string, but it is also not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

Substituting the known values:
- `{i}` will be replaced with 5.
- `{i}` again will be replaced with 5.
- `{prev}` will be replaced with 4.
- `{prev}` again will be replaced with 4.

So, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **? 5 5 4 4**
