Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` must be at least 6, but its exact value is not specified.
- `r` is an input string, but its value is not provided.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

Given the explicit value of `i` is 2, and since `prev` is not defined in the initial state, it implies that `prev` is undefined or not set. In this context, if `prev` is not set, it would typically be treated as an empty string or not included in the output.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? 2 2  {}  {}'**
