Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 6, `v2` is 3, `v1` is 2, and the value of `r` remains unchanged as it was input by the user.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or change their values. It only ensures that all previously written output is flushed (sent to the standard output). Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.
