Output State: **`i` is 5, `prev` is 4, `r2` is an input from the user**

The code `r2 = input('')` assigns the value entered by the user as a string to the variable `r2`. The values of `i` and `prev` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 4 is not directly affected by this code, so it remains valid.
