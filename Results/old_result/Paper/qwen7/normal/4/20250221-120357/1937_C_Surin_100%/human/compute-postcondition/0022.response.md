Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `v2` is 2 (not involved in the loop head)
   - `v1` is 2 (not involved in the loop head)
   - `r` is an input string from the user (not involved in the loop head)

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, so for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3, and `n` must still be at least 2.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, `i` will be 3 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` must remain at least 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Final state**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `v2` remains 2 (unchanged)
   - `v1` remains 2 (unchanged)
   - `r` remains an input string from the user (unchanged)

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, `v2` is 2, `v1` is 2, `r` is an input string from the user**
