Output State: **`i` is 3, `prev` is 3, `r2` remains unchanged if `r2` equals '<', and `r` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 3) to `prev`. The values of `i` and `prev` are updated, while the conditions for `r2` and the value of `r` remain unchanged.
