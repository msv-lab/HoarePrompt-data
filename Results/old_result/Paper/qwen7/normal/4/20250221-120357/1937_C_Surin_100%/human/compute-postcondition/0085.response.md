Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `r` is an input string (though its value is not needed for this specific print statement).
   - `v2` is `n - 1`.
   - `v1` is `n - 1`.
   - `prev` is `i`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `f'! {prev} {v1}'`.

3. **Substituting Values**:
   - Since `i` is 1, `prev` is also 1.
   - Since `n` is at least 2, `v2` and `v1` both become `n - 1`. However, their exact values are not specified, but they are equal.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The print statement will output the formatted string `! 1 [v1]`, where `[v1]` is the value of `n - 1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **! 1 [n - 1]**
