Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `r` is an input string (its value is not specified, so it remains as `r`)
- `v2` is 1
- `v1` is 0
- `prev` is 1
- `kp` is 0
- `g` is 0

The `print` statement is:

```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Breaking down the placeholders in the formatted string:

- `{v1}` will be replaced with the value of `v1`, which is 0.
- `{v2}` will be replaced with the value of `v2`, which is 1.

Therefore, the string will be formatted as:

```
'? 0 0 1 1'
```

Output: **'? 0 0 1 1'**
