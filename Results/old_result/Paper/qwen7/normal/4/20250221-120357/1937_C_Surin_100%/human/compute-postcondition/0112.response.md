Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `r` is the input string from the user, `v2` is 3, `v1` is 2, `prev` is 1, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or change their values. It only ensures that any buffered data in the standard output buffer is written out immediately. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
