Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 4.
- `n` must be greater than 4, but its exact value is not specified.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Here, `i` is directly provided as 4. However, `v1` and `prev` are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine their values from the given information.

Given this, the most precise description we can provide is that `v1` and `prev` are undefined variables, and `i` is 4. Therefore, the output will include `?`, followed by the placeholder `{v1}`, the value of `i` (which is 4), another placeholder `{v1}`, and finally another placeholder `{prev}`.

Output: **? {v1} 4 {v1} {prev}**
