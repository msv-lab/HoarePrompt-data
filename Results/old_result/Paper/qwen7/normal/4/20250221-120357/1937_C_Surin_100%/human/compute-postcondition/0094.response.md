Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is an input string, `v2` is 1, `v1` is 0, `prev` is 1, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all pending buffered data is written to the terminal. However, this operation does not affect any variable values or conditions. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
