Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `r` is an input string, `prev` is equal to `i` from the previous iteration, `r2` is an input string**

The code `r2 = input('')` assigns the value entered by the user as a string to the variable `r2`. The values of `i`, `n`, `r`, and `prev` remain unchanged from their initial states.
