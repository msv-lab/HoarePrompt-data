Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 4.
- `n` is stated to be greater than 4 but no specific value is provided, so we cannot determine its exact value.
- `r` is an input string but no specific value is provided, so we cannot determine its exact content.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

Here, `{i}` is replaced with the value of `i`, which is 4. `{prev}` is used twice, but there is no explicit definition of `prev` in the initial state. Since `prev` is not defined, we cannot determine its value.

Given this, the print statement will output a string with placeholders for `prev` that we cannot resolve.

Output: **'? 4 4 prev prev'**
