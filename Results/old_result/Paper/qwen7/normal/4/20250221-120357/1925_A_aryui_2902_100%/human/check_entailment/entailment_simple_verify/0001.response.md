### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to generate a string `s` such that every possible string of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appears as a subsequence in `s`.
   - The string `s` should have the smallest possible length, and if there are multiple valid strings of the same length, any one of them is acceptable.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()` and prints the result.
   - The function `func_1()` reads `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - It generates a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets repeated `n` times (`s[:k] * n`).

3. **Checking the Correctness**:
   - The function `func_1()` does not actually ensure that every possible string of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appears as a subsequence in `s`. Instead, it simply repeats the first `k` characters `n` times.
   - This approach will fail for most test cases because it does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` are covered. For example:
     - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the string "baab" is correct because it contains all subsequences "aa", "ab", "ba", and "bb". However, the generated string "abab" would also be correct but the given implementation does not produce this.
     - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the string "abcbac" is correct because it contains all subsequences of length 2 using the first three alphabets. However, the generated string "abcbac" is correct, but the implementation does not guarantee this for all cases.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to generate the required string `s` for each test case based on the constraints and examples provided. It fails to ensure that every possible subsequence of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets is included in the generated string.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not guarantee that every possible subsequence of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets is included in the generated string.
