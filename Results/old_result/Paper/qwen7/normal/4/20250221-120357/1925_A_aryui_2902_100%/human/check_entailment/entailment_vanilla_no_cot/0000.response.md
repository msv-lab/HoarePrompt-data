Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it simply repeats the first `k` lowercase letters `n` times. This approach does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets will appear as subsequences in the generated string `s`.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to construct a string `s` that contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. One efficient way to do this is to use de Bruijn sequences, which are cyclic sequences that contain every possible subsequence of a given length over a specified alphabet exactly once.

Here's a corrected version of the program using a de Bruijn sequence approach:

```python
def de_bruijn(k, n):
    def db(t, p):
        if t > n:
            if n % p == 0:
                for j in range(1, p + 1):
                    yield ''.join(map(str, path[-n + j:]))
        else:
            a = [0] * p
            for x in db(t + 1, p):
                for j in range(p):
                    if not a[j]:
                        a[j] = 1
                        path[t] = j
                        yield from db(t + 1, p)
                        a[j] = 0
    path = [0] * (n + k - 1)
    return list(db(1, k))

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    result = de_bruijn(k, n)
    print(result[0])
```

This program uses a recursive generator function to build a de Bruijn sequence for the given parameters `k` and `n`. The sequence generated ensures that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are included.
