Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and still satisfies the condition `1 ≤ t ≤ 676`. Therefore, `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, while `n` and `k` are the integers obtained from the input.
