t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n} of length n are given, where each character in these strings is either '0' or '1'. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
