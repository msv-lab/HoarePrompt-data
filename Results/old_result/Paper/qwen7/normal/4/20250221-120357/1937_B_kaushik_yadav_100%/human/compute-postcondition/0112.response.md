Output State: **`work` is True, `i` is 2, `ans` is the first character of `a`, `counter` is 3, `t` is 1, `a` is the input string with length greater than 0, `b` is the new input string, the character at index `i + 1` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 1, so now `i` is 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
