Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is the length of string `a`
- `ans` is the concatenation of characters from both strings `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop
- `counter` is 2
- `j` is 1

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < len(a) - 1`.
2. **Current Values**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2.

### Adjusting States:
- **`j`**: It needs to be incremented by 1 to 2.
- **`counter`**: Since the loop condition does not directly affect `counter`, it remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it. However, based on the given information, `counter` is set to 2 initially and is not modified within the loop body (as per the problem statement).

### New State:
- `i` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `ans` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `counter` remains 2.
- `j` is incremented to 2.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is the length of string `a`, `ans` is the concatenation of characters from both strings `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop, `counter` is 2, and `j` is 2**.
