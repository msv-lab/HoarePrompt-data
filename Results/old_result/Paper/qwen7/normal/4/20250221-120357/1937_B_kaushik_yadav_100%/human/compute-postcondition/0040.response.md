Postcondition: `i` is either 3 or 4, `ans` is updated to `ans` + `a[3]`. If `work` is true and `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is further updated to `ans` + `b[3]` + `b[3]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `work` is false or the conditions are not met, `i` becomes 4 and `ans` is updated to `ans` + `a[3]`.
