Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, `work` is False, `ans` is an empty string, `counter` is either 1 or 2, `t` is 0, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the new input string stripped of whitespace.**

Explanation: The line `i = 0` sets the variable `i` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
