Output State: **`i` is either 3 or 4; `ans` is `ans` + `a[3]` if `i` is 3, or `ans` + `a[4]` if `i` is 4; `work` is False.**

Explanation: The variable `work` is set to `False`, which does not affect the values of `i` or `ans`. The condition for updating `ans` remains unchanged based on the value of `i`.
