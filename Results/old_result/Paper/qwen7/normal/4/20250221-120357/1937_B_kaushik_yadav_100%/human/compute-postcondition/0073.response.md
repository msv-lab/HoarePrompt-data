Output State: **`i` is the length of string `a`, `ans` is the concatenation of characters from both strings `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop, `counter` is 2, and `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `counter` was incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `i`, `ans`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
