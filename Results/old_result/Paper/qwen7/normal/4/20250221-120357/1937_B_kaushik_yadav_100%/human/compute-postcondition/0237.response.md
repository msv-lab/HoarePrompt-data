State: **`counter` is 1, `j` is 0, `a` must have more than 1 element** 

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains the variables `j` and the range function's argument, which is `len(a) - 1`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `len(a) - 1 >= 0` must be true. This means `len(a)` must be at least 1.
3. Since the loop variable `j` starts from 0 (the default starting value for `range`), it needs to be set to 0.
4. The initial value of `counter` is 1, but this does not affect the loop's execution condition directly.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` to 0 and `a` must have more than 1 element to ensure the loop can execute.
