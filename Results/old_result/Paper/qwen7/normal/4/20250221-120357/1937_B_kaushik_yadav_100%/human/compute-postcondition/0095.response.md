Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `a`, `ans` is an empty string, `counter` is 3, `t` is 1, `a` is the input string, `b` is the new input string.**

The code `ans = ''` initializes the variable `ans` as an empty string. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
