Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, `work` is False, `ans` is the first character of `b`, `counter` is either 1 or 2, `t` is 0, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the new input string stripped of whitespace, and `len(a)` is greater than 0.**

The code `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of `b` to the string `ans`. Since `i` is 0, `ans` is updated to be the first character of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
