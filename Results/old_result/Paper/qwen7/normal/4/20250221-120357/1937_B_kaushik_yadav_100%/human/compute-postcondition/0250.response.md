Postcondition: `counter` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 0, `a` has more than 1 element. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is 2. Otherwise, `counter` remains 1. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', the condition remains as specified in the if part. Otherwise, if `a[j + 1]` is not '0' or `b[j]` is not '1', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.
