Output State: **`i` is either 3 or 4; `ans` is `ans` + `a[3]` if `i` is 3, or `ans` + `a[4]` if `i` is 4.**

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` adds the value of `a[i]` to `ans`. Since `i` can be either 3 or 4, `ans` will be updated to `ans + a[3]` if `i` is 3, or `ans + a[4]` if `i` is 4. The initial condition that `i` must be less than `len(a)` remains unchanged.
