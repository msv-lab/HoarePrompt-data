Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ar` is a map object containing strings of integers sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code takes an input of space-separated integers, converts them to integers, sorts them in ascending order, and then maps each integer to a string. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was just used to determine the number of inputs but not modified by the code. The variable `ar` now holds a map object that contains the sorted and converted integers as strings.
