Given the initial state where `n` is an input integer and `ar` is a map object containing strings of integers sorted in ascending order, let's break down the code snippet:

```python
print(' '.join(ar))
```

Here, `ar` is a map object (which is typically a dictionary in Python) containing keys as some identifiers and values as strings representing integers. Since `ar` is sorted in ascending order, the keys are in ascending order, and the values are strings of integers.

The `join` method is used to concatenate the values from the dictionary into a single string, with each value separated by a space. Therefore, the output will be a single string where each value from the dictionary is a string of an integer, and these values are concatenated together with spaces in between.

Since the exact contents of `ar` are not specified, we can only describe the general form of the output.

Output: **a single string containing the integer values from the map `ar`, each represented as a string and separated by a space**
