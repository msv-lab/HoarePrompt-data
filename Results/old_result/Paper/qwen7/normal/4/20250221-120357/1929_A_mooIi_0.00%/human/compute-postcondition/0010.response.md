Output State: **`n` is the new input integer which is less than the original input integer, `ar` is a map object containing strings of the new integers sorted in ascending order based on the new input integers**.

Explanation: The code first takes a new input integer `n`, which is less than the original input integer. Then, it converts the input string into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`, sorts this list in ascending order, and finally maps each integer to a string using `map(str, ...)`. The resulting `ar` is a map object containing these string representations of the integers, sorted in ascending order based on the new input integers.
