Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The current implementation simply sorts the array and prints it, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty as defined.

To solve this problem correctly, you should arrange the elements such that the positive differences between consecutive elements are maximized while minimizing the negative ones. One effective strategy is to place the smallest element at the beginning and the largest at the end, then alternate placing the next smallest and largest remaining elements. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are as large as possible in magnitude.
