Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of map objects, each containing strings of integers sorted in ascending order. Each map object corresponds to the sorted integers from one of the input test cases. The number of map objects is equal to the total number of test cases provided as input.

In natural language, this means that for each test case given as input, the program will output a list of integers sorted in ascending order. The process will repeat for every test case until all test cases have been processed, resulting in a sequence of sorted lists, one for each test case.
