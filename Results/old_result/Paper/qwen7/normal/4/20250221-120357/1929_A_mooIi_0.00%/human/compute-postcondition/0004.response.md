Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a map object containing strings of integers sorted in ascending order.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for a number of times equal to the integer input by the user.
2. **Variables in Loop Head**: The loop uses `_` (an underscore) as a placeholder for the loop variable, but it does not actually use this variable within the loop. The loop simply iterates `int(input())` times.
3. **State Adjustment**: Since the loop does not depend on any specific variables inside the loop body, the only thing that changes with each iteration is the number of iterations remaining.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
- At the end of the previous iteration, the user has already input an integer value for `n`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, the number of remaining iterations must be reduced by 1.

### New State
- The integer `n` will be decremented by 1 because the loop is iterating one more time.
- The map object `ar` remains unchanged since the loop does not modify it.

### Final Answer
State: **`n` is an input integer decremented by 1, `ar` is a map object containing strings of integers sorted in ascending order**. 

To express this more formally:
State: **`n` is an input integer minus 1, `ar` is a map object containing strings of integers sorted in ascending order**.
