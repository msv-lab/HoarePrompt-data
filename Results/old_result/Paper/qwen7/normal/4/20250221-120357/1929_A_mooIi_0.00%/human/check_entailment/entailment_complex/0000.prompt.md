Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        
        print(' '.join(ar))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will have processed all the test cases provided as input. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `ar` is a map object containing strings of integers sorted in ascending order based on the input integers for that specific test case.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the program will have read all the test cases, sorted the integers provided for each test case in ascending order, and printed them out. Each test case's output will reflect the sorted integers for that particular set of inputs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes input data for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) (number of test cases, where \( 1 \leq t \leq 500 \)), an integer \( n \) (number of integers in each test case, where \( 2 \leq n \leq 100 \)), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) (each integer in the range \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \)). It sorts these integers in ascending order and prints them out. The function does not return any value but ensures that all test cases are processed and their sorted integers are printed accordingly.
