Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. However, the program simply sorts the array in ascending order and prints the sorted array. This approach does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array according to the given definition.

To maximize the beauty, we should aim to maximize the positive differences between consecutive elements while minimizing the negative ones. One effective strategy is to place the largest element at the beginning and the smallest at the end, with the rest of the elements in any order in between. This way, the difference between the first and second largest elements will be maximized, and so on.

Given this, the provided program does not achieve the objective of maximizing the beauty of the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
