Reasoning:
The given program is designed to solve the problem correctly. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case. It reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` which represent the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s respectively.

2. **Calculation Logic**: 
   - The expression `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` calculates how many pairs of numbers can be formed from the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. Since the bitwise XOR of a pair of identical numbers is zero, this part ensures that we count the number of pairs that can be removed without affecting the overall XOR result.
   - The expression `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if the sum of the remainders of the counts when divided by 2 equals 3. If so, it adds 1 to the total count. This is because removing one number from each of three different types (e.g., one 1, one 2, and one 3) would make the XOR of the remaining numbers non-zero, ensuring Alice's loss and Bob's win.

3. **Output**: The program prints the calculated value for each test case, which represents the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function matches the required solution. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
