Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is equal to the length of the input string `s`.
   - `n` is also equal to the length of the input string `s` (since `n` is mentioned to be the same as `i`).
   - `x` is either -1 or the index where `s[i]` is not equal to `s[0]` (if such an index exists), but `x` is not equal to -1. This means `x` is the index where the first character of the string does not match itself, which is impossible unless there is a mismatch somewhere in the string.
   - The function `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
   ```

Given that `x` is not -1, it must be an index within the string `s` where the character does not match the first character. Let's denote the string `s` as `s = "abcde"` for illustration purposes. If `s[0]` is 'a', then `x` could be any index from 1 to 4 where `s[x]` is not 'a'. For example, if `s = "abced"`, then `x` would be 1 because `s[1]` is 'b', which is not equal to 'a'.

- `s[:x + 1]` will be the substring starting from the beginning of `s` up to and including the character at index `x`.
- `s[x + 1:]` will be the substring starting from the character after index `x` to the end of the string.

For instance, if `s = "abced"` and `x = 1`:
- `s[:x + 1]` will be `"ab"`.
- `s[x + 1:]` will be `"ced"`.

Therefore, the print statement will output these two substrings separated by a space.

Output: **s[:x + 1] s[x + 1:] (where s[:x + 1] is the substring from the start of s up to and including the character at index x, and s[x + 1:] is the substring from the character after index x to the end of s)**
