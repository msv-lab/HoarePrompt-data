Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Value of `i`**: The value of `i` is equal to the length of the input string `s`.
2. **Value of `n`**: The value of `n` is also equal to the length of the input string `s`.
3. **Value of `x`**: 
   - `x` is either -1 or the index where `s[i]` is not equal to `s[0]` (if such an index exists).
   - `x` is not equal to -1.
   - The function `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`.
   - The condition `(x == 1 or x == n // 2)` is false.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the implications:

- Since `x` is not -1 and the condition `(x == 1 or x == n // 2)` is false, `x` must be some other index between 1 and `n-1` (exclusive of 1 and `n//2`).

- The function `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returning `True` implies that the substring starting from `s[x+1]` to the end of the string `s` satisfies some condition specified by `func_1`.

However, the specific value of `x` does not affect the output of the `print` statement, which is simply `'YES'`.

Therefore, regardless of the values of `i`, `n`, and `x`, the `print` statement will always output `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
