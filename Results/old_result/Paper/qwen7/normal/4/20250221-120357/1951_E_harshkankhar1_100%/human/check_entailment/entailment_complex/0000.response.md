### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome.
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is correctly implemented and serves its purpose.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function reads an input string `s`.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s)`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome (`func_1(s)` returns `False`), it prints "YES", `1`, and the string `s` itself. This is correct because the whole string can be a valid partition.
     - If `s` is a palindrome (`func_1(s)` returns `True`), it proceeds to find the first character in `s` that is different from the first character.
       - If no such character exists (`x` remains `-1`), it prints "NO". This is correct because if all characters are the same, no valid partition exists.
       - If such a character exists, it checks if the substring starting from this character is not a palindrome (`func_1(s[x + 1:])`).
         - If this substring is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", `2`, and the two partitions: `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
         - If this substring is a palindrome, it further checks if `x` is exactly at the midpoint of the string (`x == 1` or `x == n // 2`). If so, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES", `2`, and the two partitions: `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop iterates over the test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_2()` which processes the input string according to the logic described above.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_2` correctly identifies whether a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
- The function handles all edge cases, such as when the string is a single character (which is always a palindrome) and when the string is composed of repeating characters.
- The output format matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. All functions work together to ensure that the program meets the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
