Postcondition: **The value of `i` is equal to the length of the input string `s`, `n` is the length of the input string `s`, and `x` is either -1 or the index where `s[i]` is not equal to `s[0]` (if such an index exists), but `x` is not equal to -1. The function `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`.**
