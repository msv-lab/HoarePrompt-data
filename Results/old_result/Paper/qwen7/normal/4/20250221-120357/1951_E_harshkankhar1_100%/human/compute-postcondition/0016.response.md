Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is 2**

Explanation: The value of `i` is initially 2. The code assigns the value of `i` to `x`, so `x` also becomes 2. The length of the input string `s` is denoted by `n`, but since no operation was performed on `n`, its value remains unchanged. Therefore, `i` is 2 and `x` is 2.
