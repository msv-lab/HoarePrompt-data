Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if a string is a palindrome. However, it is defined within `func_2`, which means it cannot be used outside of `func_2`. It should be defined at the top level so it can be called from anywhere.

2. **Handling of Palindromes**: The logic in `func_2` to check for palindromes is flawed. It only checks the first character and the middle of the string, which is not sufficient to ensure that no substring is a palindrome.

3. **Input Handling**: The program reads input from `input()`, which is not suitable for this problem since the input is expected to be passed as arguments to the function. The program should take a string as an argument instead of reading from `input()`.

4. **Output Format**: The program should handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement. It should read the number of test cases and process each test case accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def solve(s):
    if is_palindrome(s):
        return "NO"
    else:
        # Split the string into two parts
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            if not is_palindrome(s[:i]):
                return "YES", 2, s[:i], s[i:]
        return "NO"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1

    for _ in range(t):
        s = data[index]
        index += 1
        result, k, *parts = solve(s)
        if result == "YES":
            print(result)
            print(k)
            print(" ".join(parts))
        else:
            print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version:
- Defines `is_palindrome` at the top level.
- Reads multiple test cases from standard input.
- Checks if the string is a palindrome and splits it if necessary.
- Prints the appropriate output for each test case.
