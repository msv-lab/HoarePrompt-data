Reasoning:
- The problem requires partitioning a string into substrings such that none of these substrings are palindromes.
- `func_1` correctly checks if a given string is a palindrome.
- `func_2` attempts to solve the problem by checking certain conditions:
  - If the entire string is not a palindrome, it immediately returns a valid partition.
  - If the string consists of repeated characters, it returns 'NO' because no valid partition exists.
  - Otherwise, it tries to find a point to split the string so that at least two non-palindromic substrings result.
- Let's analyze the logic of `func_2`:
  - It first checks if the entire string is a palindrome using `func_1`. If it is not, it directly prints "YES" and the string itself as a single partition.
  - If the entire string is a palindrome, it looks for the first character that is different from the first character of the string.
  - If such a character is found, it splits the string at that point and checks if the resulting substrings are non-palindromic.
  - If the split results in valid non-palindromic substrings, it prints "YES" and the two substrings.
  - If the split does not work (e.g., the string has only one unique character or the split is at the midpoint of the string), it prints "NO".

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in `func_2`, it correctly handles all cases described in the problem statement. Therefore, the implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True**
