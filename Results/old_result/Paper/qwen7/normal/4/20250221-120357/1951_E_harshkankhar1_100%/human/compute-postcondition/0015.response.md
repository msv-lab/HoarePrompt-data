Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Initial Conditions**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
   - There is no change in `n` and `s` remains unchanged.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, the next value of `i` would be 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged because there is no modification to `n` within the loop.
   - The string `s` remains unchanged as there is no operation modifying it within the loop.

5. **Post-Iteration State**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` remains the same (length of `s`).
   - `s` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the length of the input string `s`**.
