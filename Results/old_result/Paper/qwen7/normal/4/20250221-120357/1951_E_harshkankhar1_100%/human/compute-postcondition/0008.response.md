Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 1 in the loop head (`for i in range(1, n)`).
   - The variable `n` is the length of the input string `s`.

3. **Check the current state**:
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `x` is -1.
   - `func_1(s[0:])` returns True.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 1 in the loop, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 1.
   - `n` should be the length of the string `s`, which is already correctly represented in the given state.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The only variables that need adjustment are `i` and `n`. We need to ensure that `i` is 1 and `n` is the length of the string `s`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the length of the input string `s`**
