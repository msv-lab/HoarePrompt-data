Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the length of the input string `s`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i` and `n`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was inside. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
