Based on the initial state provided:

- The value of `i` is equal to the length of the input string `s`.
- The value of `n` is also equal to the length of the input string `s`.
- The variable `x` is either -1 or the index where `s[i]` is not equal to `s[0]` (if such an index exists), but `x` is not equal to -1.
- The function `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`.

The print statement is simply `print(2)`, which means it will print the number 2 directly.

Output: **2**
