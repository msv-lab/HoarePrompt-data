Output State: **`mx` is either 4 or 6, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is either 4 or 2, `subseq_lens` is a list containing [3] or [3, 4], `i` is 3**.

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `mx`, `t`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, and the range of `t` remain unchanged.
