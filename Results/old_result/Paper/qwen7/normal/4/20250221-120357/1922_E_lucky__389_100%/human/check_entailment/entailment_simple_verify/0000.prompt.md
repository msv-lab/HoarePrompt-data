You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

        i = 0

    #State: Output State: `mx` is either 4 or 6, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing [3, 4, i - 1] with `i` being the last value of `i` calculated before `x` became 0, and `i` is at least 5.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is not 0. After each iteration, `x` is reduced by the largest power of 2 less than or equal to its current value, and `subseq_lens` records the length of the corresponding subsequence. Since `x` starts at 4 and the loop reduces it by powers of 2 until it reaches 0, the loop will execute exactly 3 times as described. The final value of `x` will be 0, and `subseq_lens` will contain the lengths of the subsequences found during each iteration. The value of `mx` will be the maximum of these lengths, which is either 4 or 6 based on the given conditions.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 5, `subseq_lens` is unchanged, `ansv` contains the elements `subseq_lens[2]`, `subseq_lens[3]`, `subseq_lens[4]`, `subseq_lens[5]`, and `subseq_lens[6]`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = len(subseq_lens) - 1`. Given `subseq_lens` has 3 elements (3, 4, 5), the loop will run 2 times (since it starts from 1). After the loop completes, `i` will be `len(subseq_lens)` which is 3 + 1 = 4. However, since the loop increments `i` each time it runs, `i` will be 5 after the last iteration. The list `ansv` will contain all elements from `subseq_lens` starting from index 2 up to the end, which are `subseq_lens[2]`, `subseq_lens[3]`, and `subseq_lens[4]`. Since `subseq_lens` only has 3 elements, the loop will append these elements to `ansv` and stop, resulting in `ansv` containing `[3, 4, 5]`. But since the loop runs 2 full iterations, it will append one more element, making `ansv` contain `[3, 4, 5, 5, 6]` if we consider the next hypothetical element as 6 following the pattern. However, based on the given information, `ansv` will contain `[3, 4, 5]` repeated twice and then the next element 6, so the final `ansv` will be `[3, 4, 5, 5, 6]`.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 3
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 5, `ansv` is `[3, 4, 5, 5, 6]`.
    #
    #**Natural Language Description:** After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be 5 because the loop increments `i` each time it runs, and it runs until `i` reaches the length of `ansv`, which is 5. The list `ansv` will contain the elements `[3, 4, 5, 5, 6]` because the loop appends the elements from `subseq_lens` starting from index 2 up to the end, and it does this twice before stopping, resulting in the final list being `[3, 4, 5, 5, 6]`.
    print()
    #This is printed: None



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, but it does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to produce an array for certain values of \(X\), particularly when \(X\) is a prime number greater than 2. For example, when \(X = 3\), the program does not provide a valid array. 

To illustrate, let's consider the case when \(X = 3\):

- The program tries to decompose \(X\) into powers of 2, but since 3 cannot be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2, it fails to generate a valid array.
- The current implementation only handles cases where \(X\) can be decomposed into distinct powers of 2, which is insufficient to cover all possible \(X\) values.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
