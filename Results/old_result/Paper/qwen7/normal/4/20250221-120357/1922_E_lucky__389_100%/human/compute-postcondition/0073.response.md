Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state tells us that `i` is set to 5.
2. `ansv` is a list containing the elements `[3, 4, 5, 5, 6]`.
3. The `print` statement accesses the element at index `i` in the list `ansv` and prints it with no newline (`end=' '`).

Given that `i` is 5, we need to access the element at index 5 in the list `ansv`. Note that list indices in Python start from 0, so the element at index 5 is actually the last element in the list.

The last element in the list `ansv` is 6.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **6**
