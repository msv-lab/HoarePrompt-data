Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `res` will be equal to the number of unique elements in the list `a`, and `count` will contain entries for each unique element in `a` transformed by the operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`. If an element appears more than once in `a`, its corresponding entry in `count` will be decremented by the number of times it appears minus one.**

This means that after the loop completes, `res` will reflect how many distinct elements were processed, and `count` will store the transformed values of these elements, adjusting their counts based on their occurrences in the original list `a`.
