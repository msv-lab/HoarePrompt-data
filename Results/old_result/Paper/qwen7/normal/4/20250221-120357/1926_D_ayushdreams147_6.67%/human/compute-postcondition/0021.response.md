Output State: **`res` is incremented by 1, `count[num]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `count[num] -= 1` decrements the value of `count[num]` by 1. The initial state mentions that `res` is incremented by 1 and `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is incremented by 1 if `num` is not already in `count`, otherwise `count[num]` is decremented by 1. However, since the specific value of `num` is not given, we only know that `count[num]` is decremented by 1. The other conditions remain unchanged.
