You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of integers, and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that each integer in the list is less than \(2^{31}\).
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `res` will be equal to the number of unique elements in the list `a`, and `count` will contain entries for each unique element in `a` transformed by the operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`. If an element appears more than once in `a`, its corresponding entry in `count` will be decremented by the number of times it appears minus one.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique elements in the list 'a', denoted as 'res'. Each unique element in 'a' is transformed by the operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`, and these transformed values are stored in the dictionary 'count'. If an element appears more than once in 'a', its corresponding entry in 'count' will be decremented by the number of times it appears minus one.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of integers, and `a`, a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\). It returns the number of unique elements in the list `a`, denoted as `res`. Each unique element in `a` is transformed by the operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`, and these transformed values are stored in the dictionary `count`. If an element appears more than once in `a`, its corresponding entry in `count` will be decremented by the number of times it appears minus one.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the number of unique elements in the list 'a', denoted as 'res'. Each unique element in 'a' is transformed by the operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`, and these transformed values are stored in the dictionary 'count'. If an element appears more than once in 'a', its corresponding entry in 'count' will be decremented by the number of times it appears minus one.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
