Output State: **`res` is incremented by 1, `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is incremented by 1 if `num` is not already in `count`, otherwise `count[num]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. The values of `a` and `count` remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition for incrementing or decrementing the count in `count` remains the same as well.
