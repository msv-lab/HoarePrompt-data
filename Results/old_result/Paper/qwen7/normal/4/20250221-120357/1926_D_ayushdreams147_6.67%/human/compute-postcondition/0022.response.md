Postcondition: `a` is a list of `n-2` non-negative integers with at least 0 elements, `res` is incremented by 1, and `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is incremented by 1 if `num` is not already in `count`, otherwise `count[num]` is decremented by 1. This holds true whether `num` is in `count` or not, as in both the if and else parts, `res` is incremented by 1 and the operations on `count` are performed accordingly.
