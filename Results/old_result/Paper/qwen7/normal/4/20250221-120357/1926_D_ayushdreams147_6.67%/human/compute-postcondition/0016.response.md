Postcondition: `a` is a list of `n-1` non-negative integers with at least 1 element, `res` is incremented by 1, `num` is the second element in the list `a`. If `num` is not in `count`, then `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is incremented by 1. If `num` is already in `count`, then `count[num]` is decremented by 1.
