Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `R` is a list of integers converted from the input using map and int functions.**

Explanation: The code `R = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `R`. The values of `t`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, and `L` remain unchanged from their initial state.
