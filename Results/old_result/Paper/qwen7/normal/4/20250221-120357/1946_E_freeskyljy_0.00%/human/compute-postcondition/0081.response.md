Output State: **The program returns ans, which is the product of all nums_left values from R[0] + 1 to N-1 modulo MOD.**

Given the initial state:
- `nums_left` is 0
- `cur` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `i` equals `R[cur]` during the last iteration
- `i` is equal to `N - 1`
- `i` is less than `N`
- `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1`
- `ans` is the product of all `nums_left` values from `R[0] + 1` to `N-1` modulo `MOD`

Since `nums_left` is initially 0, and there are no other updates or changes to `nums_left` mentioned in the provided code snippet, the value of `ans` remains as the product of all `nums_left` values from `R[0] + 1` to `N-1` modulo `MOD`. Given that `nums_left` starts at 0, the product of any sequence including 0 will be 0.

Therefore, the program returns 0.
