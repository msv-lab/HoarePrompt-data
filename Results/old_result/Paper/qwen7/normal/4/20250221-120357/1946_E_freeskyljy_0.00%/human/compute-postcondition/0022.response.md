Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the initial state step by step:

### Given Loop:
```python
while i > 1:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Initial State:
- `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`
- `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`
- `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`
- `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers
- `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces
- `R` is a list of integers converted from the input using `map` and `int` functions
- The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`
- The first element of `L` is 1
- The first element of `R` is equal to `N`
- Either `M1` is not greater than 1, or `M2` is not greater than 1, or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`
- `cur` is `M1 - 2`
- `i` is `L[-1] - 1`

### Analysis:
The loop condition is `i > 1`. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be greater than 1.

### Current State of `i`:
- `i` is `L[-1] - 1`

### Required Condition:
- For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be greater than 1.

### Adjustment Needed:
- Since `i` is defined as `L[-1] - 1`, we need to ensure that `L[-1] - 1 > 1`.
- This simplifies to `L[-1] > 2`.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `L[-1]` to ensure that `i` is greater than 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `R` is a list of integers converted from the input using `map` and `int` functions, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, the first element of `R` is equal to `N`, either `M1` is not greater than 1, or `M2` is not greater than 1, or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`, `cur` is `M1 - 2`, and `L[-1]` must be greater than 2**
