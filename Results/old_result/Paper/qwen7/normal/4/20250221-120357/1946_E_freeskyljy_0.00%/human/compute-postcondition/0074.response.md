Postcondition: `nums_left` is reduced by 1, `cur` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `i` equals `R[cur]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `i` must still be less than `N`, `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1`, and if `i` equals `R[cur]`, then `ans` remains unchanged; otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left - 1) % MOD`.
