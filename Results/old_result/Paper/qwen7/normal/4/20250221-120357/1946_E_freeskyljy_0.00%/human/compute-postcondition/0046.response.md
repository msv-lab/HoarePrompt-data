Output State: `nums_left` is `L[-1] - len(L)`, `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `R` is a list of integers converted from the input using `map` and `int` functions, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, the first element of `R` is equal to `N`, either `M1` is not greater than 1, or `M2` is not greater than 1, or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`, `cur` is `M1 - len(L)`, and `i` is 1.

Explanation: The loop runs until `i` becomes 1. Since `i` starts from `L[-1] - 1` and decreases by 1 each iteration, the number of iterations is `L[-1] - 1`. Therefore, after all iterations, `nums_left` will be `L[-1] - (L[-1] - 1) = L[-1] - len(L) + 1 - 1 = L[-1] - len(L)`, `i` will be 1, and `cur` will be `M1 - len(L)` as `cur` is updated by `-1` each time `i` matches `L[cur]`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as it is only modified when `i` does not match `L[cur]`, and since `i` eventually reaches 1, it will match `L[cur]` on the last iteration, leaving `ans` as the initial value calculated as `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
