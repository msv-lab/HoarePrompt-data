The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `N`.

Right before the loop, `i` is `R[0] + 1`, and `N` is an integer. Since `i` is already set to `R[0] + 1`, we need to ensure that `R[0] + 1` is less than `N` for the loop to execute the first time. Therefore, `N` must be greater than `R[0] + 1`.

State: **`cur` is 1, `i` is `R[0] + 1`, and `N` must be greater than `R[0] + 1`**
