Output State: **`nums_left` is reduced by 1, `cur` is 1, `i` is `R[0] + 1`, and `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `nums_left -= 1` decreases the value of `nums_left` by 1. Since `cur` was previously 2, and the condition for updating `cur` to 2 is met only when `i` equals `R[cur]`, which is not the case here (as `i` is now `R[0] + 1`), `cur` remains 1. Similarly, since the condition for setting `i` to `R[1]` is not met, `i` is now `R[0] + 1`. The condition for `N` being greater than `R[1]` is also not affected by this line of code, so `N` remains greater than `R[0] + 1`.
