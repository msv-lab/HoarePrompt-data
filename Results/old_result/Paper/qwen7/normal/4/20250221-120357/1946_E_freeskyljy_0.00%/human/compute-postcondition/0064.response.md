Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < N`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `nums_left` is reduced by 1 (this state is not part of the loop head).
   - `cur` is 1 (this state is not part of the loop head).
   - `i` is `R[0] + 2` (this is part of the loop head).
   - `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1` (this is part of the loop head).

3. **Determine Which States Need Adjustment**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < N`.
   - Currently, `i` is `R[0] + 2` and `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `N`.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `N` for the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `N` is already greater than `R[0] + 1`, we don't need to adjust `N`.
   - We need to ensure that `i` is less than `N`. Given that `i` is `R[0] + 2`, we need to make sure `i` is less than `N`.

Therefore, the state that needs adjustment is `i` should be less than `N`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`nums_left` is reduced by 1, `cur` is 1, `i` must be less than `N`, and `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1`**
