Output State: **`nums_left` is reduced by 1, `cur` is 1, `i` is `R[0] + 2`, and `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `R[0] + 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `R[0] + 2`. The other variables (`nums_left`, `cur`, and `N`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
