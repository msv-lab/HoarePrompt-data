Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the scenario where the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum do not match, which is a critical condition as mentioned in the problem description. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the number of prefix maximums and suffix maximums are both greater than 1 and the second-to-last prefix maximum matches the second suffix maximum, which should result in no valid permutations.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
4 2 2
1 3
3 2
```

In this case, the prefix maximums are at indices 1 and 3, and the suffix maximums are also at indices 1 and 3. According to the problem description, such a configuration should allow for multiple valid permutations. However, the current implementation incorrectly returns 0, indicating no valid permutations, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the matching conditions more comprehensively and ensure that all valid permutations are counted correctly.
