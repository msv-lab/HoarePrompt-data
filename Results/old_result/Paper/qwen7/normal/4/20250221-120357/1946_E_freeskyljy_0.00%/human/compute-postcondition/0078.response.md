Output State: `nums_left` is reduced to 0, `cur` is equal to the length of `R` (let's denote it as `len_R`), `i` is equal to `N`, and `ans` is the product of all `nums_left` values from the initial state to 1, modulo `MOD`.

Explanation: The loop continues until `i` is no longer less than `N`. Given that `nums_left` is decremented by 1 in each iteration and starts at a value that allows the loop to run at least 3 times, it will eventually reach 0. Since `cur` increments by 1 each time `i` equals `R[cur]`, and assuming `R` has `len_R` elements, `cur` will become `len_R` once all elements in `R` have been checked. The variable `i` will increment until it reaches `N`. The value of `ans` is updated in each iteration where `i` does not equal `R[cur]`, multiplying `nums_left` by itself minus one modulo `MOD` each time.
