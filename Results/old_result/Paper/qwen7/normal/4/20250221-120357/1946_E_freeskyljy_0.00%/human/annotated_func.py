        #
        #Explanation: The loop runs until `i` becomes 1. Since `i` starts from `L[-1] - 1` and decreases by 1 each iteration, the number of iterations is `L[-1] - 1`. Therefore, after all iterations, `nums_left` will be `L[-1] - (L[-1] - 1) = L[-1] - len(L) + 1 - 1 = L[-1] - len(L)`, `i` will be 1, and `cur` will be `M1 - len(L)` as `cur` is updated by `-1` each time `i` matches `L[cur]`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as it is only modified when `i` does not match `L[cur]`, and since `i` eventually reaches 1, it will match `L[cur]` on the last iteration, leaving `ans` as the initial value calculated as `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
    #State: `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `R` is a list of integers converted from the input using `map` and `int` functions, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, the first element of `R` is equal to `N`, either `M1` is not greater than 1, or `M2` is not greater than 1, or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`, `cur` is `M1 - len(L)`, and `i` is 1. If `M1 > 1`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - len(L)`, `cur` is `M1 - len(L)`, and `i` is 1. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables.
    nums_left = N - R[0] - 1
    if (M2 > 1) :
        cur = 1
        i = R[0] + 1
        while i < N:
            if i == R[cur]:
                cur += 1
            else:
                ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
            
            nums_left -= 1
            
            i += 1
            
        #State: Output State: `nums_left` is 0, `cur` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `i` equals `R[cur]` during the last iteration, `i` is equal to `N - 1`, `i` is less than `N`, `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1`, and `ans` is the product of all `nums_left` values from `R[0] + 1` to `N-1` modulo `MOD`.
        #
        #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `nums_left` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until there are no more elements left. The value of `cur` will depend on whether `i` equals `R[cur]` during the last iteration, as it increments `cur` only when `i` matches `R[cur]`. The variable `i` will be `N - 1` since it starts from `R[0] + 1` and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `N - 1`. The condition `i < N` must hold true for the loop to complete its iterations. Additionally, `N` must be greater than `R[0] + 1` for the loop to start executing. Finally, `ans` will be the cumulative product of all `nums_left` values from `R[0] + 1` to `N-1`, taken modulo `MOD`.
    #State: `nums_left` is 0, `cur` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `i` equals `R[cur]` during the last iteration, `i` is equal to `N - 1`, `i` is less than `N`, `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1`, and `ans` is the product of all `nums_left` values from `R[0] + 1` to `N-1` modulo `MOD`.
    return ans
    #The program returns ans, which is the product of all nums_left values from R[0] + 1 to N-1 modulo MOD.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes input lists `L` and `R` and predefined variables `N`, `M1`, `M2`, and `MOD`. It returns 0 in three specific cases based on conditions involving these inputs. In the fourth case, it calculates and returns the product of all `nums_left` values from `R[0] + 1` to `N-1` modulo `MOD`.
