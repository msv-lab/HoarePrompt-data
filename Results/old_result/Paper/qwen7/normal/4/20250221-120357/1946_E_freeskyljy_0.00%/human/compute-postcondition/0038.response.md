Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i > 1`.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`
   - `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`
   - `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`
   - `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers
   - `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces
   - `R` is a list of integers converted from the input using `map` and `int` functions
   - The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`
   - The first element of `L` is 1
   - The first element of `R` is equal to `N`
   - Either `M1` is not greater than 1, or `M2` is not greater than 1, or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`
   - `cur` is `M1 - 4`
   - `i` is 1
   - If `i` equals `L[cur]`, then `ans` remains unchanged, otherwise `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 4) % MOD`

3. **Determine the Adjustment Needed**:
   - The loop condition `i > 1` requires `i` to be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.
   - Currently, `i` is 1, so we need to change `i` to a value greater than 1.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**State:**
- `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`
- `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`
- `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`
- `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers
- `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces
- `R` is a list of integers converted from the input using `map` and `int` functions
- The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`
- The first element of `L` is 1
- The first element of `R` is equal to `N`
- Either `M1` is not greater than 1, or `M2` is not greater than 1, or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`
- `cur` is `M1 - 4`
- `i` must be greater than 1

State: **`nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`, `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `R` is a list of integers converted from the input using `map` and `int` functions, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, the first element of `R` is equal to `N`, either `M1` is not greater than 1, or `M2` is not greater than 1, or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`, `cur` is `M1 - 4`, `i` must be greater than 1**
