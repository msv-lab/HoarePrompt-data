Output State: **`nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, `ans` is the result of math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `R` is a list of integers converted from the input using map and int functions, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Additionally, the first element of `L` is 1, the first element of `R` is equal to `N`, and either `M1` is not greater than 1, or `M2` is not greater than 1, or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`; `cur` is `M1 - 2`, and `i` is `L[-1] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `i = L[-1] - 1` assigns the value of `L[-1] - 1` to the variable `i`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The value of `i` is updated based on the last element of the list `L`.
