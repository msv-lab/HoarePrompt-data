Output State: **`nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`, `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `R` is a list of integers converted from the input using `map` and `int` functions, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, the first element of `R` is equal to `N`, either `M1` is not greater than 1, or `M2` is not greater than 1, or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`, `cur` is `M1 - 3`, and if the current value of `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, then `ans` remains unchanged; otherwise, `ans` is updated to `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (L[-1] - 2) % MOD.**

Explanation: The line `nums_left -= 1` decreases the value of `nums_left` by 1. Since `nums_left` was initially `L[-1] - 2`, after this operation, `nums_left` becomes `L[-1] - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
