Postcondition: **`nums_left` is 0, `cur` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `i` equals `R[cur]` during the last iteration, `i` is equal to `N - 1`, `i` is less than `N`, `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1`, and `ans` is the product of all `nums_left` values from `R[0] + 1` to `N-1` modulo `MOD`.**

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `nums_left` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until there are no more elements left. The value of `cur` will depend on whether `i` equals `R[cur]` during the last iteration, as it increments `cur` only when `i` matches `R[cur]`. The variable `i` will be `N - 1` since it starts from `R[0] + 1` and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `N - 1`. The condition `i < N` must hold true for the loop to complete its iterations. Additionally, `N` must be greater than `R[0] + 1` for the loop to start executing. Finally, `ans` will be the cumulative product of all `nums_left` values from `R[0] + 1` to `N-1`, taken modulo `MOD`.
