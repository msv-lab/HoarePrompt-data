Functionality: **The function processes input lists `L` and `R` and predefined variables `N`, `M1`, `M2`, and `MOD`. It returns 0 in three specific cases based on conditions involving these inputs. In the fourth case, it calculates and returns the product of all `nums_left` values from `R[0] + 1` to `N-1` modulo `MOD`.**
