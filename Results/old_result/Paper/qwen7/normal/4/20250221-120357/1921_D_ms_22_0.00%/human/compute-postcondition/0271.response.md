Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `diff1` and `diff2` are not defined, `max_heap` must now contain at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])` excluding the just popped tuple, `tp1` is `0` or `1`, `tp2` is `m - 2` or `m - 3`, `ans` is updated to `ans - item[0]`, and `tp2` is decreased by 1.**

The code `tp2 -= 1` decreases the value of `tp2` by 1. Given the initial state, `tp2` was either `m - 1` or `m - 2`. After decrementing, `tp2` will be `m - 2` or `m - 3`, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
