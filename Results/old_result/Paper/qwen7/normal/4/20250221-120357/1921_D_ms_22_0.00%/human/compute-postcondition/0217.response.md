Postcondition: `a` must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of the list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of the list `b`. After executing the if-else block, `max_heap` will either contain a tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2` holds, or a tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` otherwise.
