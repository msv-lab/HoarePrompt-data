Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`; `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2`; `ans` is increased by -item[0]**.

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `-item[0]` to its current value. The other conditions remain unchanged: `max_heap` no longer contains the item that was popped, `item` is the highest value item that was removed, and `item[2]` is still between `tp1` and `tp2`.
