Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `diff2` is not defined, `max_heap` must now contain at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])` excluding the just popped tuple, `tp1` is `0` or `1`, `tp2` is `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff1` or `ans - item[0]`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, and `item` is the tuple that was popped from `max_heap`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `diff1` as the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
