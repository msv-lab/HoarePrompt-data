Output State: `a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `diff1` and `diff2` are not defined, `max_heap` is empty, `tp1` is equal to `m`, `tp2` is equal to `-1`, `ans` is the sum of all the differences calculated during the loop iterations, and `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `max_heap` will be empty because all elements have been processed. The variables `tp1` and `tp2` will be set to their final positions, which are `m` and `-1`, respectively, indicating that all elements have been considered relative to the start and end of the list `b`. The variable `ans` will hold the total sum of the differences calculated during each iteration of the loop, based on the conditions specified in the loop body.
