Postcondition: `i` is the next value in the list `a` (let's call it `i_next_next`), `b[0]` is unchanged, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i_next_next` and `b[0]`, `diff2` is the updated absolute difference between `i - b[m - 1]`, and `max_heap` contains either the tuple `(-abs(i_next_next - b[0]), i_next_next, 0)` if `abs(i_next_next - b[0]) > abs(i_next_next - b[m - 1])` or the tuple `(-abs(i_next_next - b[m - 1]), i_next_next, m - 1)` if `abs(i_next_next - b[0]) <= abs(i_next_next - b[m - 1])`, with the additional tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` pushed into `max_heap`.
