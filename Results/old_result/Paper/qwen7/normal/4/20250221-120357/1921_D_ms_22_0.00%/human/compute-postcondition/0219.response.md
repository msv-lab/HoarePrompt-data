Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` must have at least one element.
   - `i` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of the list `b`.
   - `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of the list `b`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `a`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over each element `i` in `a`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` itself does not change; it still contains at least one element, but the first element (`i`) changes.

4. **Calculating `diff1` and `diff2`:**
   - `diff1` is the absolute difference between the new `i` (which is now the second element of `a`) and the first element of `b`.
   - `diff2` is the absolute difference between the new `i` (which is now the second element of `a`) and the last element of `b`.

5. **Final Adjusted States:**
   - `a` must still have at least one element.
   - `i` will be the second element of the list `a`.
   - `diff1` will be the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `b`.
   - `diff2` will be the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the last element of `b`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`a` must have at least one element, `i` is the second element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the last element of `b`**.
