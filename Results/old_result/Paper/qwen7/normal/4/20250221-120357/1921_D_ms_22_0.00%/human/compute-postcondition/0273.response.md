Postcondition: `a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])` excluding the just popped tuple, `tp1` is either `tp1 + 1`, `0`, `tp1`, or `1`, `tp2` is either `m - 1`, `m - 2`, `tp2 - 1`, or `tp2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff1`, `ans + diff2`, `ans - item[0]`, or `ans - diff1 - diff2`, and `item` is the tuple that was popped from `max_heap`.

This means that after executing the if-else block:
- `a` remains an empty list.
- `i` remains undefined.
- `max_heap` still contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])` excluding the just popped tuple.
- `tp1` and `tp2` can take specific updated values based on the condition inside the if statement.
- `ans` can be updated in various ways depending on the condition inside the if statement and the operations performed.
