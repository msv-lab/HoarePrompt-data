Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. All other preconditions remain valid.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b.sort()
    max_heap = []
    tp1 = 0
    tp2 = m - 1
    ans = 0
    for i in a:
        diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
        diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))
        else:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))
    while max_heap:
        item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
            diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
            diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
            if diff1 > diff2:
                tp1 += 1
                ans += diff1
            else:
                tp2 -= 1
                ans += diff2
        else:
            ans += -item[0]
            if item[2] == tp1:
                tp1 += 1
            else:
                tp2 -= 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: After all iterations of the loop, `max_heap` will be empty, indicating that all items have been processed. The variable `ans` will hold the sum of the negative differences calculated during each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each item popped from `max_heap`, the code updates `ans` by adding either the negative value of the first element of the popped item, the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` if `diff2` is greater than or equal to `diff1`. Additionally, `tp1` will be incremented by 1 if `item[2]` is less than `tp1`, and `tp2` will be decremented by 1 if `item[2]` is greater than `tp2`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by the greater of `diff1` and `diff2`.

In summary, `ans` will contain the total accumulated cost based on the specified conditions, and `tp1` and `tp2` will be adjusted according to the logic described.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: After all iterations of the loop, `max_heap` will be empty, meaning it has processed all elements. The variable `ans` will hold the cumulative sum of the maximum differences encountered during each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each iteration, if the popped item's index (`item[2]`) is outside the range defined by `tp1` and `tp2`, the loop calculates the maximum difference between `item[1]` (an element from list `a`) and either `b[tp1]` or `b[tp2]`, and increments `tp1` or decrements `tp2` accordingly. If the index is within the range, `ans` is directly increased by the negative value of `item[0]`, which represents the maximum difference found so far. The process continues until `max_heap` is empty, ensuring that `ans` contains the total sum of the maximum differences for all elements in `a`.

In simpler terms, `ans` will contain the total sum of the largest absolute differences between elements in list `a` and the nearest elements in list `b` (either `b[0]` or `b[m-1]`), considering the constraints on the indices `tp1` and `tp2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: `a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `diff1` and `diff2` are not defined, `max_heap` is empty, `tp1` is equal to `m`, `tp2` is equal to `-1`, `ans` is the sum of all the differences calculated during the loop iterations, and `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `max_heap` will be empty because all elements have been processed. The variables `tp1` and `tp2` will be set to their final positions, which are `m` and `-1`, respectively, indicating that all elements have been considered relative to the start and end of the list `b`. The variable `ans` will hold the total sum of the differences calculated during each iteration of the loop, based on the conditions specified in the loop body.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
