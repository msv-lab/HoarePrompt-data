Output State: **`diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and `b[0]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and `b[m - 1]`.**

This means that `diff1` retains its original value as the absolute difference between `i` and `b[0]`, and a new variable `diff2` is introduced and assigned the value of the absolute difference between `i` and `b[m - 1]`.
