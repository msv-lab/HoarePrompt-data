Output State: **`i` is the second element of `a`; `diff1` is equal to the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is equal to the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`; `max_heap` contains a tuple with values (`-diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`).**

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple into a max heap. The tuple consists of `-diff2`, which is the negated value of `diff2`, `i`, and `m - 1`. Since the heap is a max heap, the tuple is added based on the first element, which is `-diff2`. The values of `i`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
