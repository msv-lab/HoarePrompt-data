Output State: **After all iterations, `max_heap` will contain tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` where `i` is an element from the list `a`, `index` is either `0` or `m-1`, and `diff` is the absolute difference between `i` and either `b[0]` or `b[m-1]`, whichever results in a larger difference. The heap will maintain these tuples based on the largest negative difference, ensuring that the top of the heap always corresponds to the largest such difference encountered during the loop execution.**

This means that after the loop completes, `max_heap` will contain the elements from `a` paired with their respective differences from the start and end of the sorted list `b`, prioritizing the maximum difference found during each iteration.
