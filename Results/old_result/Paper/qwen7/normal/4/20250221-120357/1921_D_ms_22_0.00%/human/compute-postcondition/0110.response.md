Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in a:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
   - `i` will take each element from the list `a` one by one during the loop execution.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. If `a` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, we need to ensure that `a` is not empty for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `i` will change during the loop execution, but we don't need to specify its initial value because the loop will start with the first element of `a`.

Given the above points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the list `a` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**State:**
**`a` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element**
