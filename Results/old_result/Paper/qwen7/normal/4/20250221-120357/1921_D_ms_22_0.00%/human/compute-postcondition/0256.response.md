Postcondition: **`a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `diff1` and `diff2` are not defined, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])` where `item[1]` is the element popped from `max_heap` and `item[2]` is either `0` or `m - 1` depending on which element of `b` was closer to the popped element, `tp1` is `1` if `item[2] == tp1`, otherwise `0`, `tp2` is `m - 1` if `item[2] == tp1`, otherwise `m - 2`, `ans` is increased by `-item[0]`, and `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `(item[2] >= tp1 and item[2] <= tp2)`**.

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` becomes `1` and `tp2` remains `m - 1`. Otherwise, `tp1` stays `0` and `tp2` becomes `m - 2`. The other variables retain their respective changes as described in both the if and else parts.
