Output State: **`max_heap` is non-empty and does not contain the item that was popped; `ans` is increased by -item[0]; `tp2` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `tp2` is decremented by 1, while `max_heap` and `ans` retain their previous states. The value of `ans` is increased by `-item[0]`, indicating that `item[0]` was the highest value item removed from `max_heap`.
