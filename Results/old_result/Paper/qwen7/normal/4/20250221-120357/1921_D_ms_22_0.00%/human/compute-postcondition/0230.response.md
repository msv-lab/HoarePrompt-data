Output State: **`a` must have at least one element, `i` is the third element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, a new max heap contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` onto a max heap. The values of `a`, `i`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged. The new information introduced is the existence of the max heap with the specified tuple.
