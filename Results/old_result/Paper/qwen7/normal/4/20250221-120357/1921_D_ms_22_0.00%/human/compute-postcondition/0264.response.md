Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[m - 2])`, `max_heap` must now contain at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])` excluding the just popped tuple, `tp1` is `tp1 + 1`, `tp2` is `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff1` or `ans - item[0]`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, and `item` is the tuple that was popped from `max_heap`, `ans` is updated by adding `diff1` to its current value.**

This means that the `ans` variable has been updated by adding the value of `diff1` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
