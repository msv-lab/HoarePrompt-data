Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`; `tp2` is decremented by 1.**

The code `tp2 -= 1` decrements the value of `tp2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
