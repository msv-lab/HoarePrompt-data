Postcondition: `a` must have at least one element, `i` is the second element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`. After the execution of the if-else block, either a new variable `max_heap` is created containing one tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2`, or a tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` is pushed into a max heap named `max_heap` if `diff1 <= diff2`.
