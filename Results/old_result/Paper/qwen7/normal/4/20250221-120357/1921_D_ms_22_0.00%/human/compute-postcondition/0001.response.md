Output State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. All other preconditions remain valid.**

This means that `t` is now set to an integer input from the user, ensuring it is within the range of 1 to 100. The other preconditions, such as the existence of `n` and `m` within their specified ranges and the properties of `a_i` and `b_i`, remain unchanged and valid.
