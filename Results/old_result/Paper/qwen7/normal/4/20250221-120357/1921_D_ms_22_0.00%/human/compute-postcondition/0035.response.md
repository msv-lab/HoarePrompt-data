Postcondition: `i` is the third element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the second last element of `b`. After the execution of the if-else block, `max_heap` contains either the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2`, or the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1 <= diff2`.
