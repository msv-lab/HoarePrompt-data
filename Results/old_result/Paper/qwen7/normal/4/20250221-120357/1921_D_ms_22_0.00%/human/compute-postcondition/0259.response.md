The loop condition is `while max_heap:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `max_heap` is not empty.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
- `a` is an empty list.
- `i` is not defined.
- `diff1` and `diff2` are not defined.
- `max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])`.
- `tp1` is `0` or `1`.
- `tp2` is `m - 1` or `m - 2`.
- `ans` is updated to `ans + diff1` or `ans + diff2` or `ans - item[0]`.
- `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.

For the loop to execute one more time, `max_heap` must still contain at least one tuple. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `max_heap` is not empty.

State: **`a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `diff1` and `diff2` are not defined, `max_heap` must contain at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])`, `tp1` is `0` or `1`, `tp2` is `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff1` or `ans + diff2` or `ans - item[0]`, and `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**
