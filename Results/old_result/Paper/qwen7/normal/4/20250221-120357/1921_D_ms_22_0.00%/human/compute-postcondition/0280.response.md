Output State: **`max_heap` is non-empty and does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`; `tp1` is incremented by 1; `ans` is increased by `diff1`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += diff1` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `diff1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
