Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`.**

The code calculates the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` and assigns it to `diff1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
