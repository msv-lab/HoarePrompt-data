Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `diff2` as the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. The values of `max_heap`, `item`, and `diff1` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `diff2` is introduced as a new variable holding the calculated value.
