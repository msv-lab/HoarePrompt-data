Postcondition: `ans` is increased by `-item[0]`, `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `ans` is additionally increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.
