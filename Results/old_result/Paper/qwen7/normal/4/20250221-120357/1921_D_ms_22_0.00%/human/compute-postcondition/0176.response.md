Postcondition: `ans` is increased by either the maximum of the absolute differences between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` or `b[tp2]`, depending on the condition `item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2`. If the condition is true, `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`; `ans` is increased by the chosen difference, and `tp1` or `tp2` is adjusted accordingly. If the condition is false, `ans` is increased by `-item[0]`, and `tp1` is incremented by 1 if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, otherwise `ans` is increased by `-1`.
