The loop condition is `while max_heap:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `max_heap` is not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:

- `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped.
- `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`.
- `ans` is increased by either `diff1` or `diff2` depending on whether `item[2]` is closer to `b[tp1]` or `b[tp2]`.
- `tp1` is increased by 1 and `tp2` is decreased by 1 if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`.
- Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is further increased by 1 if `item[2]` equals `tp1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `max_heap` must still be non-empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `max_heap` is not empty.

State: **`max_heap` is not empty**
