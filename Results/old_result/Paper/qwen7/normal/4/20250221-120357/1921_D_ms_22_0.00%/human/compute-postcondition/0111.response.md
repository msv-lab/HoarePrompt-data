Output State: **`diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and `b[0]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between the variable `i` and the first element of the list `b` (denoted as `b[0]`) and assigns it to the variable `diff1`. Since the initial values of `i` and `b[0]` are not specified, `diff1` is expressed as the absolute difference between these two variables.
