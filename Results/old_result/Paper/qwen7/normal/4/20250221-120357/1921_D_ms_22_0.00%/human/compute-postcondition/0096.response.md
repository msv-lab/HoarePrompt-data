Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `ans` is increased by either the negative value of the first element of the popped item, the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` (if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`), or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` (if `diff2` is greater than or equal to `diff1`); if `item[2]` is less than `tp1`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1; if `item[2]` is greater than `tp2`, then `tp2` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `ans` is increased by the greater of `diff1` and `diff2`.
