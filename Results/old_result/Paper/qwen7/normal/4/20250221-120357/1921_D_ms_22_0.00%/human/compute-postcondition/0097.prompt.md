Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `max_heap` will contain tuples where each tuple consists of a negative difference value, an element from list `a`, and an index from list `b`. The negative difference value is derived from the absolute difference between an element from `a` and an element from `b`. The index indicates which element from `b` was used to compute the difference.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`; `ans` is increased by either `diff1` or `diff2` depending on whether `item[2]` is closer to `b[tp1]` or `b[tp2]`; `tp1` is increased by 1 and `tp2` is decreased by 1 if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`; otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is further increased by 1 if `item[2]` equals `tp1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `ans` is increased by either `diff1` (where `diff1 > diff2`) or `diff2` (where `diff1 <= diff2`); `tp1` is incremented by 1 if `diff1 > diff2`, otherwise `tp2` is decremented by 1; if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is 1; `ans` is increased by `-item[0]` if `item[2]` is neither `tp1` nor `tp2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `ans` is increased by either the negative value of the first element of the popped item, the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` (if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`), or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` (if `diff2` is greater than or equal to `diff1`); if `item[2]` is less than `tp1`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1; if `item[2]` is greater than `tp2`, then `tp2` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `ans` is increased by the greater of `diff1` and `diff2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
