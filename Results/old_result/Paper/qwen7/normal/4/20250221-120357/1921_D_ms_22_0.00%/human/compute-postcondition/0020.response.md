Postcondition: `i` is the first element of `a`; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`; either `max_heap` contains one tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `max_heap` contains one tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, depending on whether `diff1` is greater than `diff2` or not.
