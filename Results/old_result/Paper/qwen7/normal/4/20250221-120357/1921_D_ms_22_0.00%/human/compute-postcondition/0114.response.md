Output State: **`diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and `b[0]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and `b[m - 1]`, and a tuple (`-diff1`, `i`, `0`) has been pushed into `max_heap`.**

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple containing `-diff1`, `i`, and `0` into `max_heap`. Since `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and `b[0]`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and `b[m - 1]`, and initially `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, the value of `diff1` remains unchanged. The value of `i` also remains unchanged. A new element is added to `max_heap`, which is the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`.
