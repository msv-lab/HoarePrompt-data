Output State: **`tp2` is decremented by 1, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`.**

The value of `tp2` is decremented by 1, while the values of `diff1`, `max_heap`, `item`, and `diff2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
