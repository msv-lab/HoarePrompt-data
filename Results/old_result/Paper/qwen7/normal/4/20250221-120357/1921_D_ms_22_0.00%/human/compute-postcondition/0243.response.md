Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2 - 1])`, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])`, `tp1` remains `0`, `tp2` is `m - 2`, `ans` remains `0`, and `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `tp2 -= 1` decrements the value of `tp2` by 1. Initially, `tp2` was `m - 1`. After decrementing, `tp2` becomes `m - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
