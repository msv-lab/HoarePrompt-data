The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `max_heap` will be empty, indicating that all items have been processed, and `t` will be 0. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`max_heap` will be empty, `ans` will hold the sum of the negative differences calculated during each iteration of the loop, `tp1` and `tp2` will be adjusted according to the logic described, and `t` must be greater than 0**.
