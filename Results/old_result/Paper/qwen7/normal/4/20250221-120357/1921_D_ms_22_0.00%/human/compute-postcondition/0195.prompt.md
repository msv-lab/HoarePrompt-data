Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations, `max_heap` will contain tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` where `i` is an element from the list `a`, `index` is either `0` or `m-1`, and `diff` is the absolute difference between `i` and either `b[0]` or `b[m-1]`, whichever results in a larger difference. The heap will maintain these tuples based on the largest negative difference, ensuring that the top of the heap always corresponds to the largest such difference encountered during the loop execution.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`; `ans` is increased by either the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` depending on which difference is greater. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` or `diff2` is chosen accordingly, and either `tp1` is incremented by 1 or `tp2` is decreased by 1. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2`, `ans` is increased by `-item[0]`, and if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `item[2]` is not equal to `tp1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`; `ans` is increased by either the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` depending on which difference is greater. If `diff1` (the difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`) is greater, `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1. Alternatively, if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `ans` is increased by -1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `max_heap` is not empty and does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by the greater of `diff1` and `diff2` or -item[0], `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 if `diff1` is greater, otherwise `tp2` is decremented by 1, and if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `ans` is increased by -1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
