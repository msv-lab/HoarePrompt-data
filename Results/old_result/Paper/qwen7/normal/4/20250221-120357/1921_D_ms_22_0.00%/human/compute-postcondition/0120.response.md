Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is from the list `a`.
   - There are no other variables in the loop head except `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that there are more elements left in the list `a` to iterate over.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was set to the current element from the list `a`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be set to the next element in the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to update its value to the next element in the list `a`.

Given the postcondition and the loop structure, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` has moved to the next element in the list `a`.

**State:**
- `i` is now the next element in the list `a`.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we can denote it as `i_next`, where `i_next` is the next element in the list `a`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `i_next` (the next element in the list `a`)**
