Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0], `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by `-item[0]`. Since `item[0]` is a specific value (let's denote it as `val`), `ans` is updated to `ans + -val`. The other variables (`max_heap`, `item`, and `item[2]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
