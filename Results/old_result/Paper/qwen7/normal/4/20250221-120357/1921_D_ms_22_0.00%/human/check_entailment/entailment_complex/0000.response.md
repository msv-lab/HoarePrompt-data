Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting and Heap Initialization**: The array `b` is sorted, and a max heap (`max_heap`) is initialized to store the differences and their corresponding indices in `b`.

3. **Heap Operations**: For each element in `a`, the program calculates the absolute differences with the smallest and largest elements in `b` and pushes the larger difference into the heap along with its index in `b`.

4. **Processing the Heap**: The program then processes the heap to ensure that the differences are applied optimally. It ensures that the indices `tp1` and `tp2` are within bounds and updates the answer `ans` accordingly.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total difference `ans` for each test case.

Given the detailed explanation of the program's logic and the step-by-step reasoning through the states and operations, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to maximize the total difference `D`.

Correctness: **True**
