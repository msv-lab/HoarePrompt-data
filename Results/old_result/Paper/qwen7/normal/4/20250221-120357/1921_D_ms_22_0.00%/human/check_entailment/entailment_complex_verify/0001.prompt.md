You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

Specifically, for each item popped from `max_heap`, the code updates `ans` by adding either the negative value of the first element of the popped item, the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` if `diff2` is greater than or equal to `diff1`. Additionally, `tp1` will be incremented by 1 if `item[2]` is less than `tp1`, and `tp2` will be decremented by 1 if `item[2]` is greater than `tp2`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by the greater of `diff1` and `diff2`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes two integers \( n \) and \( m \), and two lists of integers \( a_i \) and \( b_i \). It sorts the list \( b \) and then calculates the sum of the minimum absolute differences between elements of \( a_i \) and the closest elements in \( b \). Specifically, for each element in \( a_i \), it finds the closest element in \( b \) and adds the absolute difference to the total sum. The function returns the total sum of these differences for all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the sizes of arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It then reads the elements of arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting and Heap Initialization:**
   - Array `b` is sorted.
   - A max heap (`max_heap`) is initialized to store tuples of differences and indices.

3. **Heap Population:**
   - For each element in `a`, it calculates the absolute differences with the smallest and largest elements in `b`.
   - Depending on which difference is larger, it pushes a tuple into the heap. The tuple includes the negative of the difference (to simulate a max heap), the element from `a`, and the index from `b`.

4. **Heap Processing:**
   - The program processes the heap to maximize the total difference `D`.
   - It ensures that the chosen elements from `b` are within the range `[tp1, tp2]`.
   - If the current element in the heap is out of the range, it recalculates the difference using the closest available elements in `b`.
   - Otherwise, it directly adds the negative of the difference to the answer and updates the pointers `tp1` and `tp2`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements, it prints the total difference `ans`.

### Verification:

1. **Heap Initialization and Population:**
   - The heap correctly stores the maximum possible differences for each element in `a`.
   - Sorting `b` ensures that the smallest and largest elements are always accessible.

2. **Heap Processing Logic:**
   - The logic for updating `tp1` and `tp2` ensures that the chosen elements from `b` are used optimally to maximize the difference.
   - The conditions for updating `tp1` and `tp2` handle edge cases where the current element in the heap is out of the range `[tp1, tp2]`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where `b` might have duplicate values or when `a` and `b` have different values but the same range.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the total difference `D`.

### Conclusion:
The program is designed to solve the problem as specified and handles all the necessary steps correctly.
