Output State: **`i` is the first element of `a`; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`; a tuple (`-diff1`, `i`, 0) is pushed into `max_heap`.**

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple containing `-diff1`, `i`, and `0` into `max_heap`. Since `heapq.heappush` modifies the heap in place, the values of `i`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged. The precondition that `diff1 > diff2` also remains valid.
