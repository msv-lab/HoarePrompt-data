Based on the initial state provided, the variable `ans` holds the sum of the negative differences calculated during each iteration of the loop. This sum is derived from the conditions specified for updating `ans` with the negative value of the first element of the popped item, or the absolute differences between certain elements as described.

Given the conditions and the fact that `max_heap` is empty after all iterations, it implies that all items have been processed and the value of `ans` is fully computed.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the negative differences calculated during each iteration of the loop based on the specified conditions)**
