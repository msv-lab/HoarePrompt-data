Postcondition: `a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])` excluding the just popped tuple, `tp1` is either `tp1 + 1` or `0`, `tp2` is either `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff1` or `ans - item[0]`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, and `ans` is updated by adding either `diff1` or `diff2` to its current value.
