Output State: **`i` is the second element of `a`; `diff1` is equal to the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is equal to the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.**

In this output state, the variable `diff2` has been assigned the value of the absolute difference between `i` (the second element of `a`) and the last element of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
