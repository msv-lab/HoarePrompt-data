To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]`.

1. **Condition `j < m`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `j + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must still be less than `m`.
   - Since `j` was incremented by 1, `j` is now `j + 1`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to continue, `j + 1` must be less than `m`.

2. **Condition `b[j] != a[i]`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`.
   - For the loop to continue, `b[j + 1]` (the next character in the string `b`) must not be equal to `a[i]`.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that both conditions hold true for the next iteration.

- The first condition requires `j + 1 < m`.
- The second condition requires `b[j + 1] != a[i]`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be `j + 1` (which is already the case).
- `m` should be greater than `j + 1`.
- `b[j + 1]` should not be equal to `a[i]`.

State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `m` must be greater than `j + 1`, and `b[j + 1]` must not be equal to `a[i]`**
