Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The only variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `b` is a non-empty string
   - `j` is equal to `m`
   - `k` is 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`. After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the new state after one iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Check if the loop can continue**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` was previously equal to `m` (assuming `i` was initialized to `m`), after one iteration, `i` becomes `m + 1`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` is now `m + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `t`, `b`, `j`, and `k` remain in their previous states since they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is equal to `m`, and `k` is 0, `i` is `m + 1`**.
