Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- The loop condition is `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `previous_j + 2` where `previous_j` is less than `m - 1` and `b[previous_j + 2]` is not equal to `a[i]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]`.
2. **Current State**: 
   - `j` is `previous_j + 2`.
   - `previous_j` is less than `m - 1`.
   - `b[previous_j + 2]` is not equal to `a[i]`.

### Conditions for Next Iteration
- For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `m` and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.
- Since `j` is currently `previous_j + 2`, the next value of `j` would be `previous_j + 3`.

### Adjusting the State
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m` and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.
- Given that `j` is currently `previous_j + 2`, we need to ensure that `previous_j + 3` is less than `m` and `b[previous_j + 3]` is not equal to `a[i]`.

### Conclusion
- The only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` to ensure it meets the loop condition in the next iteration.
- Specifically, `j` should be set to `previous_j + 3` to satisfy the condition `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]`.

### Final State
State: **`j` is `previous_j + 3` where `previous_j` is less than `m - 1` and `b[previous_j + 3]` is not equal to `a[i]`**
