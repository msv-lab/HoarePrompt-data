Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is greater than or equal to `m + n`.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `b` is a non-empty string.
- `k` is either 0 or a value between 0 and `n`, inclusive.
- `i` is `m + n - 1`.
- For all `p` where `m <= p < j`, `b[p]` is not equal to `a[i]` if `k` is greater than 0.

The print statement is `print(k)`. 

To determine what will be printed, we need to consider the possible values of `k`:

- `k` can be either 0 or any value between 0 and `n`, inclusive.
- There is no additional information provided about `k` other than its range and the condition involving `b[p]` and `a[i]`.

Given the condition "for all `p` where `m <= p < j`, `b[p]` is not equal to `a[i]` if `k` is greater than 0," this implies that if `k` were greater than 0, then there would be some `p` in the range `m <= p < j` such that `b[p]` is not equal to `a[i]`. However, since the problem does not specify any specific value for `k` and only provides its range, `k` could be any value within that range.

Therefore, without additional constraints or specific values for `k`, the most precise description of the output is simply the value of `k`.

Output: **k**
