Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a string obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `b` is a string obtained from the next input.**

The code `b = input()` reads a string from the input and assigns it to the variable `b`. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `n` remains a string obtained from the first space-separated integer input. The new variable `b` is assigned the value of the next input string.
