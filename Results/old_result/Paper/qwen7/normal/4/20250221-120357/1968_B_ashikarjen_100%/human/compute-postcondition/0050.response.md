Output State: **`j` is greater than or equal to `m + n`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `k` is either 0 or a value between 0 and `n`, inclusive, `i` is `m + n - 1`, and for all `p` where `m <= p < j`, `b[p]` is not equal to `a[i]` if `k` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n - 1` (since the loop runs for each index from 0 to `n-1`). The variable `j` will be greater than or equal to `m + n` because the loop increments `j` for each match found, and it breaks when `j` reaches `m + n`. The variable `k` will be the count of matches found during the loop, which can range from 0 to `n`. For all indices `p` where `m <= p < j`, `b[p]` will not be equal to `a[i]` if `k` is greater than 0, indicating that there were matches found during the loop.
