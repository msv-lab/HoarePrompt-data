Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `a` times, processing each test case individually.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to have `c` cubes after `b` moves.

3. **Conditions Checked:**
   - **Condition 1:** `b == c`
     - If the number of moves (`b`) equals the desired number of cubes (`c`), it prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves is equal to the desired number of cubes, and each move adds one cube, then it's possible.
   - **Condition 2:** `b < c`
     - If the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes, it prints 'NO'. This condition is incorrect because it's possible to have more cubes than moves if there are removals involved.
   - **Condition 3:** `b % 2 == c % 2`
     - If the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of moves matches the parity of the desired number of cubes, it prints 'Yes'. This is correct because the parity must match since each move either adds or removes one cube, preserving the parity.
   - **Else Condition:**
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'No'. This is correct for the remaining cases.

### Correctness Determination

- The first condition (`b == c`) is correct.
- The second condition (`b < c`) is incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility of removing cubes.
- The third condition (`b % 2 == c % 2`) is correct and handles the parity check.
- The else condition correctly covers all other cases.

Given this analysis, the program is mostly correct but has a flaw in the second condition. However, the overall logic is sound, and the program can be fixed by removing the second condition.

### Conclusion

The program, as written, is not entirely correct due to the incorrect handling of the second condition. However, the core logic is sound and can be fixed. Given the problem constraints and the provided solution, we should consider the overall intent and correctness of the logic.

**Correctness: False**
