Postcondition: `a` must be at least 1, `b` is an integer from the input split and its value is such that it is greater than or equal to `c`, `c` is an integer from the input split, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`, and the current value of `b` and `c` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd).
