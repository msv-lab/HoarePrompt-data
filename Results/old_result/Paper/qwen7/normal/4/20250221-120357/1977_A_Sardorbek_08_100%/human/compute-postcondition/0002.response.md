Output State: **`a` must be at least 1; `b` is an integer from the input split, `c` is an integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `b` and `c`. The initial state of `a` being at least 1 remains unchanged. Therefore, `a` must be at least 1, and `b` and `c` are integers from the input.
