You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and each test case consists of two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `a` will be 0, `i` will be equal to the original value of `a` (which was at least 1), and `q` will be a tuple containing the values of `b` and `c` from the last iteration of the loop. The values of `b` and `c` will be the integers provided as input in the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of pairs of positive integers (n, m) where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. For each pair, it checks the relationship between n and m and prints 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' based on specific conditions. After processing all pairs, the function ends with no return value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the condition `elif b % 2 == c % 2:` is incorrect. This condition checks if the sum of the number of moves (`b`) and the desired number of cubes (`c`) have the same parity (both are even or both are odd), but it does not correctly determine whether it is possible to achieve the desired number of cubes.

For example, consider the test case `(5, 3)`. According to the problem description, it should be possible to achieve 3 cubes after 5 moves by adding 1 cube 3 times and removing 1 cube 2 times. However, the current implementation would incorrectly print "No" because `5 % 2 != 3 % 2`.

To fix this, the program should check if the difference between `b` and `c` is even, as the number of additions and removals must balance out to achieve the desired number of cubes. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version checks if the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even, which correctly determines whether it is possible to achieve the desired number of cubes.
