Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` must be at least 1.
- `b` is an integer from the input split.
- `c` is an integer from the input split.
- `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.
- The current value of `b` is equal to `c`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `q`. Since no specific values are provided for `b` and `c`, we only know that they are equal to each other.

Output: **YES**
