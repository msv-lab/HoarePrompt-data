Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` must be at least 1.
- `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- `q` is a tuple containing the values of `b` and `c`.
- `b` and `c` are updated to their respective integer values from the input split.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
