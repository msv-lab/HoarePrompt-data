Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` must be at least 1.
- `b` and `c` are integers from the input split.
- `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.
- `q` is updated to (`b`, `c`).

The `print('Yes')` statement simply prints the string 'Yes'. Since no other variables or objects are involved in this print statement, the output is straightforward.

Output: **Yes**
