Output State: **`a` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `q` is a tuple containing the values of `b` and `c`, and `b` and `c` are updated to their respective integer values from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `q = b, c` updates the tuple `q` to contain the values of `b` and `c`. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged. Since `b` and `c` are updated to their respective integer values from the input split, they are included in the final state along with the unchanged variables `a` and `i`.
