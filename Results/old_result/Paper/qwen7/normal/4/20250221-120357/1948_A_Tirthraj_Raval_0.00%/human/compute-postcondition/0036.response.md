Output State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `pattern` is a list with elements `'B'`, `'AB'[i % 2]`, `'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1]`, and the list `pattern` has an additional element `'AB'[i % 2]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `'AB'[i % 2]` to the list `pattern`. Since `i` is `n // 2 + 1`, `i % 2` will determine whether the appended value is 'A' or 'B'. The other variables remain unchanged.
