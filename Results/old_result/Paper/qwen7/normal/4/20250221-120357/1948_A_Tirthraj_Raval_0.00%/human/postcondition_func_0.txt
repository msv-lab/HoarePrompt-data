The function processes a series of test cases (up to 50). For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it prints 'YES' and then generates a string of length `n` consisting of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, which it also prints. After processing all test cases, the function ends.
