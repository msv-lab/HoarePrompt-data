Output State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `pattern` is a list with elements 'B', 'AB'[i % 2, 'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1]].**

Explanation: The code appends `'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1]` to the `pattern` list. Given that `i % 2` can be either 0 or 1, `i % 2 ^ 1` will be 1 or 0 respectively. So, if `i % 2` is 0, `i % 2 ^ 1` will be 1, and vice versa. Therefore, the updated `pattern` list will have two elements: 'B' and the element that is the opposite of `'AB'[i % 2]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
