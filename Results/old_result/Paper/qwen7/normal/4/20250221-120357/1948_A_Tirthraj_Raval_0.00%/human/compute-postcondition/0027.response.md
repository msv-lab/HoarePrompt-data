Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `n // 2`, and `pattern` is an empty list.**

The code `pattern = []` initializes `pattern` as an empty list. It does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `i`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged.
