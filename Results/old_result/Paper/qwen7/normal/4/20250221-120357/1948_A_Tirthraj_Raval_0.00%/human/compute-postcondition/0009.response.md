Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (not directly relevant to the loop).
   - `n` is an input integer and is even.
   - `pattern` is an empty list (not directly relevant to the loop).

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(n // 2):` will execute as long as `n // 2` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `n` is even, `n // 2` will be a positive integer.
   - For the loop to execute, `n // 2` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 0 (since `n` is even, this is already given).

5. **Set the initial value of `i`**: The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be set to 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0 (which is already given since `n` is even).

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
