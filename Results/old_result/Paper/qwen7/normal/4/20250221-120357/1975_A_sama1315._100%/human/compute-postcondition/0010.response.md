Output State: **`idx` is 7 + n, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements from `data[4]` to `data[4+n-1]` to integers.**

Explanation: The variable `idx` is incremented by `n`. The other variables (`t`, `results`, and `a`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
