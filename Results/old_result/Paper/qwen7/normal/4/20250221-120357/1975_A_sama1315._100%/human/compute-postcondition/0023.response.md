Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `idx` is now 10 + n, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(a)`, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx-1]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to elements in `data` starting from `data[idx]` and taking `n` elements, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`**.

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))` creates a new list `a` by converting each element in the slice of `data` from index `idx` to `idx + n` (inclusive) using the `int` function.
- The value of `idx` is updated to `idx + n` because the slice operation `data[idx:idx + n]` includes `n` elements starting from `idx`, and after the operation, `idx` is incremented by `n`.
- All other variables (`t`, `results`, `n`, `a`, `result`) remain unchanged in terms of their values or conditions, but the value of `idx` is updated as described.
