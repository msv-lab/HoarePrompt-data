Output State: **`idx` is 2; `t` is an integer from the list `data` at index 0.**

Explanation: The variable `idx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was assigned the integer from the list `data` at index 0 and the code snippet does not modify `t`.
