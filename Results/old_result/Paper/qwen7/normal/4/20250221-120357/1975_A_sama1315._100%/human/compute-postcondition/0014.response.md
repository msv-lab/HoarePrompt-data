Output State: **`idx` is 7 + n, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(a)` and the new element `result`, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[idx]` to `n`, where `idx` is initially `7 + n`. The value of `idx` itself does not change, but `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[idx]`. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
