Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array `a`. `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ `n`. The function `input` is now set to `sys.stdin.read` for reading input.**

The code replaces the default input method with `sys.stdin.read`, which reads the entire input from standard input as a single string. However, the values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged as no assignment or modification to these variables is performed within the given code snippet.
