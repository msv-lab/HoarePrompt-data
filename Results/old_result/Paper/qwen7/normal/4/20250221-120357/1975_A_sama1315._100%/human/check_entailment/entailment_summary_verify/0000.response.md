### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the provided program does not correctly solve the problem:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `a` plus itself (`a + a`) contains a subarray that matches the sorted version of the original array `a`.
   - This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the array can be split and swapped to achieve a non-decreasing order. For example, consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. The sorted version is `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`. Even though `a + a` contains a subarray that matches the sorted version, it does not mean that the array can be split and swapped to achieve a non-decreasing order. The function `func_1` does not check for valid split points where the first part is non-decreasing and the second part is non-decreasing, and the end of the first part is less than or equal to the start of the second part.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - Since `func_1` is flawed, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results for certain test cases.

To illustrate with an example:
- Consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`.
  - The sorted version is `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`.
  - `a + a = [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]` contains a subarray `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`, which is the sorted version.
  - However, there is no valid way to split this array into two parts and swap them to achieve a non-decreasing order. The function `func_1` would incorrectly return "Yes".

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. Therefore, the final evaluation should be:

**Final: False**
