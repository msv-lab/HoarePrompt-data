You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to `n`. At this point, either the function has returned 'Yes' at some iteration when the substring of `sorted_a` starting at index `i` with length equal to the length of `sorted_a` was found within `concatenated_a`, or the function has not returned anything because no such substring was found throughout all iterations. In the latter case, the function will implicitly return 'None' (or simply continue without returning anything specific).
    #
    #This means that after all iterations, if no match was found, the function will not return anything specific, implying it might return 'None' by default, unless explicitly stated otherwise in the function's logic.
    return 'No'
    #The program returns 'No'

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array a. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

The variable `t` must be greater than 0, indicating there were enough iterations specified initially. The `results` list will contain the return values of `func_1(a)` for each iteration, with each `a` being a list of integers derived from the `data` list as described.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: the return values of `func_1(a)` for each iteration, separated by newlines




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Purpose**: This function checks if the array `a` can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.
2. **Steps**:
   - `n = len(a)`: Get the length of the array.
   - `sorted_a = sorted(a)`: Sort the array `a`.
   - `concatenated_a = a + a`: Concatenate the array with itself.
   - Loop through possible splits:
     - For each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, check if the subarray `concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)]` matches `sorted_a`.
     - If a match is found, return `'Yes'`.
   - If no match is found after the loop, return `'No'`.

**Issue with `func_1`**:
- The logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the problem's requirement of splitting and swapping parts of the array. Instead, it checks if the entire array `a` plus itself can contain a sorted version of `a` as a subarray. This is not equivalent to checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Purpose**: This function reads input and processes multiple test cases using `func_1`.
2. **Steps**:
   - Read all input at once using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - Parse the input to extract the number of test cases `t`, the size of each array `n`, and the elements of each array.
   - For each test case, call `func_1` and store the result.
   - Print the results.

**Issue with `func_2`**:
- While the function correctly handles reading and processing multiple test cases, the underlying `func_1` is flawed as explained above.

### Conclusion
Since `func_1` does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts, the overall program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**:
Correctness: **False**
