Output State: **`idx` is 8 + n, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(a)` and the new element `result`, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx-1]`**

Explanation: The code increments `idx` by 1, making it `8 + n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is greater than 0. The `results` list and its contents also remain the same. The value of `n` is updated to be the integer from `data[idx-1]`, which was `data[7 + n]` before the increment.
