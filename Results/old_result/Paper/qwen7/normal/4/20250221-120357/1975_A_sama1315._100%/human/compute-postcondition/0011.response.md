Output State: **`idx` is 7 + n, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(a)`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements from `data[4]` to `data[4+n-1]` to integers.**

Explanation: The code assigns the return value of `func_1(a)` to the variable `result`. Since `a` is already defined as a list of integers obtained by converting the specified elements from `data`, the only new information is that `result` now holds the return value of `func_1(a)`. The values of `idx`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
