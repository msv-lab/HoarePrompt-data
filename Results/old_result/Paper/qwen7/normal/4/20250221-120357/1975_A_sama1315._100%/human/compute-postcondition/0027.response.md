Output State: **The loop will have executed all its iterations, resulting in `idx` being 10 + 2*n, where `n` is the last value read from the `data` list as per the last iteration. The variable `t` must be greater than 0, indicating there were enough iterations specified initially. The `results` list will contain the return values of `func_1(a)` for each iteration, with each `a` being a list of integers derived from the `data` list as described.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `idx` will point just beyond the end of the last processed segment of the `data` list, `t` will still be positive (indicating the loop ran fully), and `results` will be a list of all the outputs from `func_1(a)` for each iteration of the loop.
