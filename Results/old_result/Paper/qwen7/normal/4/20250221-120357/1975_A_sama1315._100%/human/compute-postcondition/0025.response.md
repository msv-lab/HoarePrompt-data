Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `idx` is now 10 + n + n, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(a)`, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx-1]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to elements in `data` starting from `data[idx]` and taking `n` elements, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`**

Explanation: The code `result = func_1(a)` updates the variable `result` to be the return value of the function `func_1` applied to the list `a`. However, since the exact value of `func_1(a)` is not specified, we cannot provide a more detailed output state. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
