Based on the initial state provided:

- `idx` is calculated as `10 + 2*n`, where `n` is the last value read from the `data` list during the last iteration of the loop.
- `t` is greater than 0, indicating there were enough iterations specified initially.
- The `results` list contains the return values of `func_1(a)` for each iteration, where each `a` is a list of integers derived from the `data` list.

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the process:

1. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs for `t` iterations, where `t` is the number of times the loop was specified to run. During each iteration, `func_1(a)` is called with `a` being a list of integers derived from the `data` list.
2. **Result Collection**: The result of each call to `func_1(a)` is stored in the `results` list.
3. **Final Value of `idx`**: After all iterations, `idx` is set to `10 + 2*n`, where `n` is the last value read from the `data` list during the last iteration.

Given this, the `print('\n'.join(results))` statement will join all the elements of the `results` list into a single string, separated by newline characters (`\n`), and then print it.

Since the exact values of `data` and the results of `func_1(a)` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of the `results` list.

Output: **the return values of `func_1(a)` for each iteration, separated by newlines**
