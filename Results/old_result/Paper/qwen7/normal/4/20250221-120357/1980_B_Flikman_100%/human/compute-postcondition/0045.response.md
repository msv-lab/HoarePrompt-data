Output State: **`sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `k`, `removed_count` is `removed_count + 1`**

The code increments the value of `removed_count` by 1. Since `i` is equal to `k` and `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers, these values remain unchanged. The updated value of `removed_count` is one more than its original value.
