Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - If `sorted_a[0]` equals `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is 1.
   - If `sorted_a[0]` does not equal `favorite_value`, then the value of `removed_count` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(k)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < k`.
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 1 in the next iteration (assuming `k > 0`).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented from 0 to 1.
   - The value of `removed_count` remains unchanged based on the condition given.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 1.
- `removed_count` remains unchanged based on the condition given.

Since the exact value of `removed_count` is not specified in the postcondition without knowing the value of `sorted_a[0]` and `favorite_value`, we can only state that its value remains unchanged.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, and if `sorted_a[0]` equals `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is 1. If `sorted_a[0]` does not equal `favorite_value`, then the value of `removed_count` remains unchanged.**
