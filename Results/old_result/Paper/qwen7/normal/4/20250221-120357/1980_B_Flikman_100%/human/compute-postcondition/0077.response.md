Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the array `sorted_a`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < k`.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - If `sorted_a[0]` equals `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is 1.
   - If `sorted_a[0]` does not equal `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 1 for the next iteration.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `sorted_a` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `removed_count` remains unchanged unless `sorted_a[0]` changes, but since no information suggests that `sorted_a[0]` has changed, `removed_count` remains as it was.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `sorted_a` remains unchanged.
   - `removed_count` remains unchanged based on the condition given.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is 1, `k` is unchanged, `sorted_a` is unchanged, `removed_count` remains unchanged based on the condition given.**
