Output State: **`n` is an integer input, `f` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `a` is a list of integers inputted by the user, `favorite_value` is equal to `a[f - 1]`, `i` is equal to `k`, `removed_count` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value`, and `t` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[f - 1]` to the variable `favorite_value`. The values of `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, `i`, `removed_count`, `t`, and `sorted_a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
