Output State: **`i` is 2, `removed_count` is 3**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 2, and `removed_count` is 2 if `sorted_a[0]` equals `favorite_value`, otherwise `removed_count` is 1. The code `removed_count += 1` increments `removed_count` by 1. Since `removed_count` was initially either 1 or 2, after incrementing it becomes 2 + 1 = 3. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
