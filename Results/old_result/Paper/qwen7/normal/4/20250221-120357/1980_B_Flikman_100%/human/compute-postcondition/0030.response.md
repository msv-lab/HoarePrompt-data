Postcondition: `favorite_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a` up to index `i`, where `i` is `k-1` and `k` is greater than 0, and `removed_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` was found in `sorted_a` up to index `i`. If `removed_count` is 0, no change occurs. Otherwise, `removed_count` is greater than 0.
