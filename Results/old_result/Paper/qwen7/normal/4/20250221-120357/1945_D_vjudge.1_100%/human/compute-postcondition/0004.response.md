Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `suff[i]` is `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Range**: The loop starts from `n - 1` and goes down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by `1` each time.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`.

### Next Iteration:
- Since the loop decrements `i` by `1` each time, the next value of `i` will be `n - 2`.
- The condition `suff[i]` is defined as `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`. For the next iteration, this means `suff[n - 2]` will be `suff[n - 1] + c[n - 2]`.

### Updated States:
- `i` will be `n - 2`.
- `suff[i]` will be `suff[n - 1] + c[n - 2]`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `suff[i]` is `suff[n - 1] + c[n - 2]`**
