#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, a, b):
    c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]
    suff = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `0`; `suff[0]` will be the sum of all elements in the list `c`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop starts from `i = n - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `0`. In each iteration, `suff[i]` is updated as `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`. By the end of the loop, when `i` becomes `0`, `suff[0]` will hold the cumulative sum of all elements in `c` because each `c[i]` is added to the running total as `i` decreases from `n-1` to `0`.
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k):
        ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i + 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `suff[0]` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`, `ans` is the minimum value obtained from the expression `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range of `k`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `k`, `k` must be at least 3, `suff[0]` remains the sum of all elements in the list `c`, and `ans` holds the smallest value among `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for each `i` from 0 to `k-1`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum value of a[i] + suff[i + 1] for i in the range from 0 to k-1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, where `suff` is a list representing the cumulative sum of the minimum values of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`. The function then prints and returns this minimum value.
