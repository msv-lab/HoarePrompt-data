Output State: **`c` is a list of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])` for `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`, and `b` is a list of `n` integers where `1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9`, `suff` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is `0`.**

The code initializes a list `suff` of length `n+1` with all elements set to `0`. This does not affect the values of `c`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
