Reasoning:

1. The program correctly defines the function `func_1` which takes `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` as parameters.
2. Inside `func_1`, it creates a list `c` where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.
3. It then calculates the suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` represents the sum of the minimum values from index `i` to the end of the list `c`.
4. The variable `ans` is initialized to infinity to store the minimum cost.
5. A loop iterates through the first `k` positions, calculating the cost `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` and updating `ans` if the current cost is lower.
6. Finally, it prints and returns the minimum cost stored in `ans`.

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the logic implemented in the program matches the requirements. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in the queue.

Correctness: **True**
