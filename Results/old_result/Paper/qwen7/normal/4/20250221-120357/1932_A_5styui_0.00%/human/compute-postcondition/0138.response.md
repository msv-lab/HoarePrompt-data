Output State: **`s` is 2 if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is '*', otherwise `s` is 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `i` is the length of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement is interpreted as breaking out of the context where it was placed, which is likely a loop or conditional structure. The values of `s`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the program exits the loop or conditional block.
