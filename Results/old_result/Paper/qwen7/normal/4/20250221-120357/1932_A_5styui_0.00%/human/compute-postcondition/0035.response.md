Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is greater than 0, `s` is 2 if the character at index `j+1` of `b` is `@`, otherwise `s` is 1, `b` is a non-empty string, and the character at index `j+1` of `b` is either `@` or `*` followed by another `*`. After executing the if-else block, the loop or if statement is exited.
