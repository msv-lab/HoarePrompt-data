Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` must be greater than 0, `s` is 1 if the character at index `j+1` of `b` is `@`, otherwise `s` is 0, `b` is a non-empty string, and the character at index `j+1` of `b` is either `@` or `*` followed by another `*`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `s`, or `b`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged.
