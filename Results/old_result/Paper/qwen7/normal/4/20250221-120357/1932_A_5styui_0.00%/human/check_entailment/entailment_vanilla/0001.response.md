### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and initializes a counter `s` to keep track of the number of coins collected.
   
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**:
   - The outer loop iterates over each test case, reading the length of the path `d` and the string `b` representing the path.
   
3. **Count Coins**:
   - The inner loop iterates over each character in the string `b`. When it encounters a `'@'`, it increments the counter `s`.
   - However, there are several issues with the logic to handle thorns (`'*'`):
     - The condition `if b[:]:` is always true because `b[:]` is just a copy of the string `b`, and non-empty strings evaluate to `True`. This check is unnecessary and does not serve any purpose.
     - The condition `elif b[j + 1] == '*':` is problematic because it only checks the next character without considering the current position. If the current character is a thorn, the loop should break immediately.
     - The logic to handle thorns is incomplete and incorrect.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing each test case, the program prints the value of `s` and resets it to 0 for the next test case.

### Issues:
- The logic to handle thorns is incorrect. The program should break the loop if a thorn is encountered at the current or the next position.
- The program does not account for the possibility of thorns being at the end of the path, which would cause an out-of-bounds error.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        d = int(input())
        b = input()
        s = 0
        j = 0
        while j < len(b):
            if b[j] == '@':
                s += 1
                j += 1  # Move to the next cell after picking up a coin
            elif b[j] == '*':
                break  # Stop if a thorn is encountered
            else:
                j += 1  # Move to the next cell
        print(s)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has logical errors in handling thorns and does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

**Correctness: **False**
