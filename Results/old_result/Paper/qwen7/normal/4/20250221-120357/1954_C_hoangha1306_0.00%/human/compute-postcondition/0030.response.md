Postcondition: `kq1` is either 'min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' or '0', `kq2` is either 'max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' or 'x', `vt` is 1, `i` is 0, `x` is either `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))` or `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, and `y` is either `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))` or `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))` if `vt` equals 0. Otherwise, `kq1` is "y", `kq2` is "x", `vt` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, and `y` is `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`.
