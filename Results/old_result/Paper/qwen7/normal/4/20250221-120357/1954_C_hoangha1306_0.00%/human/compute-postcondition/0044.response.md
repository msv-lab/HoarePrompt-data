Postcondition: `kq1` is either 'min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' concatenated with the minimum value of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, or '0' concatenated with the same minimum value; `kq2` is either 'max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' concatenated with the maximum value of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, or 'x' concatenated with the same maximum value; `vt` is 1; `i` is 2; `x` is `min(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))`; `y` is `max(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))`. If `a[i] > b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the minimum and maximum values of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`. Otherwise, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the original values of `x` and `y`.
