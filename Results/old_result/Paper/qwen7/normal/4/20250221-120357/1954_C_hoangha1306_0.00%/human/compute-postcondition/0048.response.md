Postcondition: `kq1` and `kq2` are strings formed based on the comparison of elements at index 0 and 1 of arrays `a` and `b`. If `vt` equals 0, then `kq1` and `kq2` will be constructed by concatenating the minimum and maximum of the first two elements of `a` and `b` respectively, along with the minimum of the second elements of `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `kq1` and `kq2` will be constructed by concatenating the minimum and maximum of the first two elements of `a` and `b` respectively, along with `y` and `x` from the else part. The variables `vt`, `i`, `x`, and `y` retain their original values as specified in the precondition.
