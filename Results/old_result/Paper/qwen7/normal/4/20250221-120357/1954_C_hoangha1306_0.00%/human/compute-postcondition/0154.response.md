Postcondition: **`i` is less than `len(a)`, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0, `q` is `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. The current value of `vt` is 0.**
