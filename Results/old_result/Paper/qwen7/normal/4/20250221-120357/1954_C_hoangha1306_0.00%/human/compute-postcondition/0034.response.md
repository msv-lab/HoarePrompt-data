Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `a`. Therefore, we need to focus on these variables.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `a`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `kq1` is either 'min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' or '0'
   - `kq2` is either 'max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' or 'x'
   - `vt` is 1
   - `i` is 0
   - `x` is either `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))` or `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`
   - `y` is either `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))` or `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))` if `vt` equals 0. Otherwise, `kq1` is "y", `kq2` is "x", `vt` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, and `y` is `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, and the loop will increment `i` by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `i` will be 1.
   - The length of `a` remains unchanged, so the condition for the next iteration will still be `i < len(a)`.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `kq1` and `kq2` remain the same because they are not affected by the loop.
   - `vt` remains 1 because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
   - `x` and `y` remain the same because they are not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`kq1` is either 'min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' or '0', `kq2` is either 'max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' or 'x', `vt` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is either `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))` or `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, and `y` is either `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))` or `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`**
