Output State: **`kq1` is a string concatenated with `str(y)`, `kq2` is the original `kq2` plus `str(x)`, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `q` is `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `i` is `i + 1**.

This means that `kq2` has been updated by concatenating `str(x)` to its current value, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
