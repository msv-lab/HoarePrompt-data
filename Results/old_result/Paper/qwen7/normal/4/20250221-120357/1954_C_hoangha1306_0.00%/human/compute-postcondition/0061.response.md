Postcondition: `vt` is 1, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with either the string representation of `x` or `y` depending on whether `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, and `kq2` is `kq2` concatenated with the other string representation.
