Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the product of `x` and `y` by swapping their corresponding digits. Specifically, the current implementation only checks if the digits at the same position are equal and swaps them if they are not, but it does not consider the overall maximization of the product. 

For example, consider the input:
```
2
98
12
```
The program will output:
```
98
12
```
However, the optimal solution would be to swap the digits to make `x = 92` and `y = 18`, which results in a higher product (92 * 18 = 1656) compared to the original values (98 * 12 = 1176).

The program needs to consider all possible swaps to maximize the product, not just the first mismatched pair of digits.
