Postcondition: `kq1` and `kq2` are strings. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `kq1` is a string concatenated with `a[i]` and `kq2` is a string concatenated with `a[i]`. Otherwise, `kq1` is a string that concatenates either the string representation of `x` or `y` depending on whether `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, and `kq2` is a string that concatenates the string representation of `y` or `x` respectively. Additionally, if `vt != 0`, `kq1` is further concatenated with `str(y)` and `kq2` is further concatenated with `str(x)`. `a` and `b` remain as input strings, `q` is `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` and `b` remain as input strings, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `i` is incremented by 1.
