Postcondition: `kq1` and `kq2` are strings, `vt` is 1, `q` is `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `i` is less than `len(a)`, and if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, then `kq1` is 'x' and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, `kq2` is the string representation of `x` without its last character, and `kq1` is an empty string concatenated with the string representation of `x`.
