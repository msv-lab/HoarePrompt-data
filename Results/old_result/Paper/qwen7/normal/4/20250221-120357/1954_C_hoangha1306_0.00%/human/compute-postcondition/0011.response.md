Output State: **`kq2` is 'a[0]', `vt` is 0, `i` is 0 and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `kq2`, `vt`, or `i`, and the loop continues, the values of these variables remain unchanged.
