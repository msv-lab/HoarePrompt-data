Output State: **`kq1` is a string concatenated with `a[i]`, `kq2` is the original `kq2` concatenated with `a[i]`, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `q` is `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i+1])` and `int(b[i+1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i+1])` and `int(b[i+1])`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In this output state, the variable `kq2` has been updated to include the current value of `a[i]` appended to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
