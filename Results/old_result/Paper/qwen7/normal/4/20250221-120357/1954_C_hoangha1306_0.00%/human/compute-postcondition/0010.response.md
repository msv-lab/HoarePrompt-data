Output State: **`kq2` is 'a[0]', `vt` is 0, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code `kq2 = kq2 + a[i]` concatenates the value of `a[i]` to the end of `kq2`. Initially, `kq2` is an empty string, and `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, which means `a[i]` is `'a[0]'`. Therefore, `kq2` becomes `'a[0]'`. The values of `vt`, `i`, and `a[i]` remain unchanged.
