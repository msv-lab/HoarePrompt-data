Output State: **`kq1` is now the string `a[0]`, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is equal to the value of `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `kq1 = kq1 + a[i]` appends the value of `a[i]` (where `i` is 0) to the existing string `kq1`. Since `kq1` was initially an empty string, it becomes the string `a[0]`. The values of `kq2`, `vt`, `i`, and the condition `a[i]` is equal to the value of `b[i]` remain unchanged.
