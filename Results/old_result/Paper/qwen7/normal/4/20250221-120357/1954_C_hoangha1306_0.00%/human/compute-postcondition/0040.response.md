Output State: **`kq1` is either 'min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' + str(min(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))) or '0' + str(min(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))); `kq2` is either 'max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' or 'x'; `vt` is 1; `i` is 2; `x` is `min(int(a[1]), int(b[1])); `y` is `max(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))**.

This means that `kq1` now contains the value of either `'min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))'` concatenated with the string representation of `min(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))` or `'0'` concatenated with the same string representation, depending on its initial value. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
