Output State: **`kq1` is a string concatenated with `a[i]`, `kq2` is the original `kq2` concatenated with `a[i]`, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `q` is `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i+1])` and `int(b[i+1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i+1])` and `int(b[i+1])`**.

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of the variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `kq1`, `kq2`, `a`, `b`, `q`, `t`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
