Output: **-1**

Explanation: The initial state does not provide any specific values for the variables `t` and `v`. However, the `print('-1')` statement directly prints the string `-1` without relying on the values of `t` or `v`. Therefore, regardless of the conditions mentioned for `v`, the output will be `-1`.
