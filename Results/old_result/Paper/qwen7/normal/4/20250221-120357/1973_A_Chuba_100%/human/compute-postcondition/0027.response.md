Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three non-negative integers \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) where \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\). For each test case, it checks if the sum of these integers is odd. If the sum is even, it calculates a specific value based on these integers and prints it; otherwise, it prints -1. After processing all test cases, the function ends with no further operations on the input data.**
