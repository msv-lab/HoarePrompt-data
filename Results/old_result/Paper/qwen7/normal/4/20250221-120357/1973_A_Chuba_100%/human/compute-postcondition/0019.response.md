Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of integers converted from input integers**

Explanation: The code `v = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `v`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was initially greater than 0.
