Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is `x`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.** 

This postcondition remains the same because both the if and else parts do not change the values of `t`, `i`, `x`, and `y`. The if and else parts only specify conditions under which certain actions might occur, but they do not alter the variables mentioned in the postcondition.
