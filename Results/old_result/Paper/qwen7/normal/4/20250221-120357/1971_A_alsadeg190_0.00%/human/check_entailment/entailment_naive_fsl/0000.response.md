Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases `t` but then processes only one test case inside the loop without resetting variables or reading subsequent inputs. This means the program will only process the first pair of integers and then terminate, failing to process the remaining test cases. For example, if the input is:

```
10
1 9
8 4
1 4
3 4
2 0
2 4
6 9
3 3
0 0
9 9
```

The program will only output:

```
1 9
```

And then stop, failing to process the rest of the test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
