You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple pairs of integers from the user input, compares each pair, and prints the larger number followed by the smaller number. The variable `t` is not used within the function and remains unchanged. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func()` is defined.
2. **First Input**: `x` is read from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
3. **Loop Through Test Cases**: A loop runs `x` times to handle each test case.
4. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, two integers `x` and `y` are read using `input()`, split by space, and converted to integers.
5. **Comparison and Output**:
   - If `x` is greater than `y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`.

### Correctness Check:

- **Test Case Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by looping through them.
- **Input Reading**: The input reading logic is correct, splitting the input string into two integers.
- **Comparison Logic**: The comparison logic is flawed. The variables `x` and `y` inside the loop are not the same as the variables outside the loop. This means that the comparison and printing are done with the same values (`x` and `y`) instead of the actual test case values.
- **Output Order**: The output order should be the minimum value followed by the maximum value, but the current implementation does not ensure this correctly.

### Example Walkthrough:

Given the example input:
```
10
1 9
8 4
1 4
3 4
2 0
2 4
6 9
3 3
0 0
9 9
```

Expected Output:
```
1 9
4 8
1 4
3 4
0 2
2 4
6 9
3 3
0 0
9 9
```

However, the current program will produce incorrect results because it uses the same `x` and `y` variables for all test cases, leading to incorrect comparisons and outputs.

### Corrected Program:

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
    for _ in range(t):  # Loop through each test case
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())  # Read and split the input into x and y
        if x > y:
            print(y, x)  # Print y followed by x if x is greater than y
        else:
            print(x, y)  # Print x followed by y otherwise

# Call the function
func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect due to the misuse of variable names. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
