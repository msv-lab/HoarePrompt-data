Output State: **`k` must be less than or equal to 0; `i` is either 0 or 1; `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += a[i]` increments the value of `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. Since `i` is either 0 or 1, `a[i]` will be the value of `a[0]` or `a[1]`. The conditions for `k` and the value of `i` remain unchanged.
