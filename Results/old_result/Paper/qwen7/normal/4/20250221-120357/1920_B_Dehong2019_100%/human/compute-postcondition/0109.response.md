Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a variable number of test cases. For each test case, it takes three positive integers n, k, and x, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. It returns a result based on the given conditions and inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific integers n, k, x, and a list of integers a. The function processes these inputs according to certain rules (which are not detailed here) and returns a result for each test case.
