Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans1` is either `a[0] - 2 * a[x]` if `i + x < n`, or `a[0]` if there is no condition that changes its value, `ans2` is equal to `max(ans1, ans2)`**.

This means that `ans2` is now updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `ans1`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `ans1` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
