Output State: **`i` is 3; `x` must be greater than 3; `ans1` is decreased by `a[3] * 2`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` decreases `ans1` by `a[i] * 2`. Given that `i` is 3, `ans1` is decreased by `a[3] * 2`. The other variables remain unchanged, so `i` is still 3 and `x` must still be greater than 3.
