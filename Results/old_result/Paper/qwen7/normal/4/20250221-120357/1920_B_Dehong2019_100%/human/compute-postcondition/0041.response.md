Output State: **`i` is 0; `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts `a[i] * 2` from `ans1`. Given that `i` is 0, this means `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is only used as an index here. The condition that `x` must be at least 1 is not affected by this line of code.
