Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is the loop variable, and it starts from 0 (as per the standard behavior of `range(k)`).
   - `k` is the upper limit of the loop, which is a constant defined outside the loop.

3. **Understand the loop's effect on the variables**:
   - The loop runs `k` times, incrementing `i` by 1 each time.
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `k`.

4. **Consider the given conditions after the loop**:
   - `x` must be less than or equal to 0.
   - `i` is the final value of `x`, so `i` (which is `k`) must be less than or equal to 0.
   - `ans1` is the initial value of `ans1` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of list `a`.
   - `ans2` is equal to `ans1`.

5. **Adjust the states based on the loop's behavior and the given conditions**:
   - Since `i` is the final value of `x`, and `i` is `k` after the loop, `k` must be less than or equal to 0 for the condition `x <= 0` to hold true.
   - The values of `ans1` and `ans2` depend on the loop body, but the loop itself only affects `i` and `k`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `k` and `i` (which is `k` after the loop).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`k` must be less than or equal to 0, `i` is 0**
