Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of disks, `x` and `y` are lists of length `n` containing the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the centers of the disks respectively, `r` is a list of length `n` containing the initial radii of the disks, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `True`, `nodes` is an empty list, and `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of length `n` initialized to zeros.**

The code `visited[i] = True` sets the `i-th` element of the `visited` list to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
