Output State: **`j` is 1, `nodes` is a list containing node 0, `c1` is `coef1[1] + coef1[1]`, `c0` is `coef0[1] + coef0[1]`**.

Explanation: The value of `j` remains unchanged at 1. The `nodes` list also remains unchanged, containing only node 0. The variable `c1` is updated by adding `coef1[j]` to its current value, which is `coef1[1]`. Since `j` is 1, `coef1[j]` is equivalent to `coef1[1]`. Therefore, `c1` becomes `coef1[1] + coef1[1]`. The value of `c0` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code snippet.
