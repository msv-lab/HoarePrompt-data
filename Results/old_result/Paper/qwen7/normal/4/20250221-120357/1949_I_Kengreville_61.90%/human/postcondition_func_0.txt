The function processes a set of disk centers defined by their x and y coordinates and radii. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) on these disks to determine if any connected component of disks has a non-zero sum of a specific coefficient (`coef1`). If such a component exists, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any explicit value.
