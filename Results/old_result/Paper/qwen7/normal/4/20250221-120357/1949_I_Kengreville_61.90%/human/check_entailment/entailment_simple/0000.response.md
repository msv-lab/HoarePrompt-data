### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if we can decrease the radii of some disks while keeping the tangency conditions and ensuring no overlap, and the total sum of radii strictly decreases.
   - The solution uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore connected components of tangency relationships between disks.

2. **Function `dfs`:**
   - This function is used to traverse the graph of tangency relationships. It marks a node as visited, adds it to the `nodes` list, and recursively visits all nodes that are tangential to the current node.
   - For each tangential pair, it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` to ensure the tangency condition holds.

3. **Main Function `func_1`:**
   - Initializes necessary lists and variables.
   - Iterates over each disk to perform DFS if it hasn't been visited yet.
   - Checks if the sum of `coef1` for any component is non-zero, which indicates a valid way to reduce radii without violating tangency conditions.

4. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The logic correctly identifies connected components of tangency using DFS.
   - It ensures that the tangency conditions are maintained.
   - It checks if it's possible to reduce the radii of the disks in such a way that the sum of radii decreases.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where disks are tangent to each other and ensures no overlap.
   - It correctly identifies when it's possible to reduce the radii while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap.

### Conclusion:

Given the problem description and the provided annotated program, the logic appears to be correct. The program correctly identifies if it's possible to reduce the radii of the disks while maintaining tangency and ensuring no overlap, and the sum of radii decreases.

### Correctness:
**True**
