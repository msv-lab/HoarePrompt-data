Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of disks `n` and initializes lists for the coordinates (`x`, `y`) and radii (`r`) of the disks.
   - It also initializes a `visited` list to keep track of which disks have been processed and lists for coefficients (`coef0`, `coef1`).
   - A list `nodes` is used to store the nodes (disks) in the current connected component during DFS.

2. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to perform a depth-first search starting from disk `i`.
   - It checks if the current disk `j` is not visited and if the distance between disks `i` and `j` equals the sum of their radii (indicating tangency).
   - If the condition is met, it updates the coefficients and recursively calls `dfs` on disk `j`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic iterates through each disk `i` and performs a DFS if the disk hasn't been visited.
   - During the DFS, it calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for all disks in the current connected component.
   - If the sum of `coef1` is non-zero for any connected component, it means there is at least one disk where the coefficient is non-zero, indicating a possibility to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **DFS and Tangency Check**:
   - The DFS correctly identifies all disks that are tangent to the current disk.
   - The check `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` ensures that only tangency conditions are considered.

2. **Coefficient Calculation**:
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are correctly updated to reflect the relationship between the radii of tangential disks.
   - The sum of `coef1` for a connected component being non-zero indicates that it is possible to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency.

3. **Sum of Radii Decrease**:
   - The logic correctly identifies connected components and checks if the sum of `coef1` is non-zero, which implies that the sum of radii can be decreased.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
