Output State: `c0` is the sum of all values in `coef0` for each `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of all values in `coef1` for each `j` in `nodes`, `ok` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `coef0[1]` is 0, `coef1[1]` is 1, `nodes` is an empty list.

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have completed, `c0` will hold the sum of all `coef0[j]` values for each `j` in the original `nodes` list, and `c1` will hold the sum of all `coef1[j]` values for each `j` in the original `nodes` list. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 2, and `coef0[1]` and `coef1[1]` remain as specified in the initial state since they are not affected by the loop. The list `nodes` is empty because it loses one element with each iteration until it is exhausted.
