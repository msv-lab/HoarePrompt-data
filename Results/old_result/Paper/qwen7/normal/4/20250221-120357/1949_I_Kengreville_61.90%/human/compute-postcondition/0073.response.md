Output State: **`c0` is 1, `c1` is 1 + `coef1[j]`, `ok` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `coef0[1]` is 0, `coef1[1]` is 1, `j` is the next element in `nodes`.**

Explanation: The value of `c1` is updated by adding `coef1[j]` to its current value. Since `j` is the next element in `nodes`, its value remains unchanged, but `c1` now holds the sum of its original value (1) and `coef1[j]`. All other variables remain in their initial or unchanged states.
