Output State: **`nodes` is an empty list, `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for every `j` in the original `nodes`, `ok` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `coef0[1]` is 0, `coef1[1]` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `nodes = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `nodes`. This changes the value of `nodes` from its original state (which contained at least three elements) to an empty list. The other variables (`c1`, `ok`, `i`, `coef0[1]`, `coef1[1]`) remain unchanged.
