Output State: **`nodes` must have at least one element, `c0` is increased by `coef0[j]` where `j` is the current element in the `nodes` list**.

Explanation: The code `c0 += coef0[j]` increments `c0` by the value of `coef0[j]`, where `j` is the current element in the `nodes` list. The initial condition that `nodes` must have at least one element remains unchanged. The value of `c1` is not affected by this code, so it is increased by `coef1[j]` as per the initial state but not here. The output state reflects that `c0` has been updated, and the condition on `nodes` is still valid.
