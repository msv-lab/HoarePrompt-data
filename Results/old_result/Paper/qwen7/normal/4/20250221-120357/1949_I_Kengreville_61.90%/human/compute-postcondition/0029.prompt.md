Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer representing the number of disks, `x` and `y` are lists of length `n` containing the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the centers of the disks respectively, `r` is a list of length `n` containing the initial radii of the disks, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `True`, `nodes` is a list with the element `i` appended, and `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of length `n` initialized to zeros.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    dx = x[i] - x[j]
    dy = y[i] - y[j]
    if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
        coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
        coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
        dfs(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `n` is an integer representing the number of disks, `x` is a list of length `n` containing the x-coordinates of the centers of the disks, `y` is a list of length `n` containing the y-coordinates of the centers of the disks, `r` is a list of length `n` containing the initial radii of the disks, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `True` except for `visited[j]`, which is now `False`, `nodes` is a list with the element `i` appended, `coef0` is a list of length `n` initialized to zeros, `coef1` is a list of length `n` initialized to zeros, `j` is 0, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`. If `visited[j]` is `False` and the distance between disk `i` and disk `j` equals the sum of their radii, then `coef0[j]` is updated to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, `coef1[j]` is updated to `-coef1[i]`, and the `dfs` function is called with argument `j`. If the condition is not met, the variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`; `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`; if `visited[j]` is false and the distance condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` is satisfied, then `coef0[j]` is set to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j]` is set to `-coef1[i]`, and the function `dfs(j)` is called. If the distance condition is not satisfied or `visited[j]` is true, no changes are made to `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`, `j` is `k + 1`, `n` must be greater than `k + 1`, `visited[j]` is false, if `visited[j]` is false and `(r[i] + r[j])




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
