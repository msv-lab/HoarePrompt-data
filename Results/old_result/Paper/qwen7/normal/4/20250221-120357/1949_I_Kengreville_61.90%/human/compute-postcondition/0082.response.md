Output State: **All elements in `coef0` and `coef1` are either 0 or 1, `nodes` contains a list of all nodes that were visited during the execution of the loop, `c0` and `c1` are sums of `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` for each node `j` in `nodes`, and `ok` is True if the sum of `coef1[j]` for any `j` in `nodes` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- Each `coef0[i]` and `coef1[i]` will be either 0 or 1.
- The `nodes` list will include all nodes that were visited during the loop's execution.
- `c0` and `c1` will be the cumulative sums of `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` for each node `j` in `nodes`.
- `ok` will be True if there exists at least one node where `coef1[j]` is not zero; otherwise, `ok` will remain False.
