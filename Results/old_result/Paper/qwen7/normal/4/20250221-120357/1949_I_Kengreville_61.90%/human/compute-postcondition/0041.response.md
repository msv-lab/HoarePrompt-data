Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `ok` is now `ok or (coef1[0] + coef1[1] + ... + coef1[k]) != 0`.
   - `coef0[0]` is 0.
   - `coef1[0]` is 1.
   - `nodes` is a list containing node 0.
   - `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` values for each node `j` in the list `nodes`.
   - `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` values for each node `j` in the list `nodes`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` becomes 1.
   - `n` remains a positive integer.
   - `ok` remains `ok or (coef1[0] + coef1[1] + ... + coef1[k]) != 0`.
   - `coef0[0]` remains 0.
   - `coef1[0]` remains 1.
   - `nodes` remains a list containing node 0.
   - `c0` remains the sum of all `coef0[j]` values for each node `j` in the list `nodes`.
   - `c1` remains the sum of all `coef1[j]` values for each node `j` in the list `nodes`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `ok` is now `ok or (coef1[0] + coef1[1] + ... + coef1[k]) != 0`, `coef0[0]` is 0, `coef1[0]` is 1, `nodes` is a list containing node 0, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` values for each node `j` in the list `nodes`, and `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` values for each node `j` in the list `nodes`.**
