You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the index `i` on a graph defined by the coordinates and radii of disks. It marks the visited status of each disk index, adds them to the `nodes` list, and updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists based on the distance condition between pairs of disks. After completing the DFS, all disks are visited, and the `nodes` list contains all indices from `0` to `n-1`. The `coef0` and `coef1` lists are updated such that each element is either `0` or the sum of the radii of two disks minus the value of `coef0` for one of the disks, depending on whether the distance condition was met.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of disks `n` and initializes lists for the coordinates (`x`, `y`) and radii (`r`) of the disks.
   - It also initializes a `visited` list to keep track of which disks have been processed and lists for coefficients (`coef0`, `coef1`).
   - A list `nodes` is used to store the nodes (disks) in the current connected component during DFS.

2. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to perform a depth-first search starting from disk `i`.
   - It checks if the current disk `j` is not visited and if the distance between disks `i` and `j` equals the sum of their radii (indicating tangency).
   - If the condition is met, it updates the coefficients and recursively calls `dfs` on disk `j`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic iterates through each disk `i` and performs a DFS if the disk hasn't been visited.
   - During the DFS, it calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for all disks in the current connected component.
   - If the sum of `coef1` is non-zero for any connected component, it means there is at least one disk where the coefficient is non-zero, indicating a possibility to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **DFS and Tangency Check**:
   - The DFS correctly identifies all disks that are tangent to the current disk.
   - The check `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` ensures that only tangency conditions are considered.

2. **Coefficient Calculation**:
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are correctly updated to reflect the relationship between the radii of tangential disks.
   - The sum of `coef1` for a connected component being non-zero indicates that it is possible to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency.

3. **Sum of Radii Decrease**:
   - The logic correctly identifies connected components and checks if the sum of `coef1` is non-zero, which implies that the sum of radii can be decreased.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
