Output State: `nodes` must have at least three elements; `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `nodes` will contain at least three elements. For each iteration, the value of `c1` is incremented by `coef1[j]` where `j` is an element in the `nodes` list. Therefore, `c1` will be the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`.
