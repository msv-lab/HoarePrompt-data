Postcondition: **`dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`, `j` is `k + 1`, `n` must be greater than `k + 1`, `visited[j]` is false, if `visited[j]` is false and `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`, then `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j]` is `-coef1[i]`, and the function `dfs(j)` has been called. Otherwise, `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` remain unchanged.**
