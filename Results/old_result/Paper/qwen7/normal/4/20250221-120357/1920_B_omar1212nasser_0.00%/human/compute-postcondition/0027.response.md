Output State: **The program returns the maximum value among the list `pos`, which contains the value `s - 2 * n` for each iteration from 1 to the total number of iterations.**

To break this down:

- `removals` is initially greater than or equal to the total number of iterations.
- `i` is the total number of iterations plus one.
- `s` is the original sum of the elements in the list `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements.
- `n` is calculated based on the sum of the last `negatives + removals` elements compared to the sum of the last `removals` elements.
- `pos` is a list where each element is calculated as `s - 2 * n` for each iteration from 1 to the total number of iterations.

The final step is to return the maximum value from the list `pos`.
