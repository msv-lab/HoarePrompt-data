Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `removals` (an integer representing the number of elements Alice can remove), `negatives` (an integer representing the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1), and `elements` (a list of integers representing the array elements). It returns 0 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns the maximum value among the list `pos`, which contains the value `s - 2 * n` for each iteration from 1 to the total number of iterations.**
