Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - This function correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `x`, and the array `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a` in ascending order before calling `func_2(k, x, a)`.
   - The function then prints the result of `func_2(k, x, a)` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function handles the logic for Alice and Bob's actions.
   - If `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, it returns 0 directly.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the potential new sums of the array after different combinations of removals and negations.
   - It iterates through the possible removals and updates the sums accordingly, storing these sums in the list `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

Given the problem description and the annotated functions, the logic implemented in both functions aligns with the requirements:
- Alice removes up to `k` elements.
- Bob multiplies up to `x` elements by -1.
- The goal is to find the optimal sum after these operations.

The function `func_2()` correctly handles the edge case where `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3 by returning 0. For other cases, it considers all possible combinations of removals and negations to find the best outcome.

Since the functions correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
