Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Function `func_2` Logic**: The logic in `func_2` is overly simplified and does not correctly handle all edge cases. It returns a hardcoded value `0` when `removals == 6 and negatives == 3`, which is not a general solution.

2. **Handling of Removals and Negatives**: The function `func_2` does not properly account for the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. It should consider removing the smallest elements first and flipping the smallest negative elements (if they exist) to maximize the sum for Alice and minimize it for Bob.

3. **Sum Calculation**: The calculation of `s` and `n` in `func_2` does not correctly reflect the optimal strategy. Specifically, `s` and `n` should be updated based on the best possible moves for Alice and Bob.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Remove k smallest elements
        a = a[k:]
        
        # Flip x smallest negative elements
        negatives = sorted([a[i] for i in range(len(a)) if a[i] < 0])[:x]
        for i in range(x):
            a[a.index(negatives[i])] = -negatives[i]
        
        # Calculate the final sum
        print(sum(a))

# Example usage
func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that Alice removes the k smallest elements and Bob flips the x smallest negative elements, which is the optimal strategy for both players.
