Postcondition: `max_item_idx` remains 0, `pair_idx` is 1, `i` is 1, and `ans1` is the return value of `func_1(0, 1, 0, 1)`. If `ans1` equals `<`, then `max_item_idx` remains 0, `pair_idx` is 1, `i` is 1, and `ans1` is `<`. If `ans1` equals `=`, and `ans2` (the return value of `func_1(1, 1, 1, 1)`) is `>`, then `max_item_idx` remains 0, `pair_idx` is 1, `i` is 1, `ans1` is `=`, and `ans2` is `>`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `max_item_idx` will remain 0, `pair_idx` will be 1, and `i` will be 1. The value of `ans1` will depend on the outcome of the `func_1` calls within the if and else parts. If `ans1` is `<`, then `ans1` will be `<`. If `ans1` is `=` and `ans2` is `>`, then `ans1` will be `=` and `ans2` will be `>`.
