Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `max_item_idx` remains 0.
   - `pair_idx` is either 0 or unchanged.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `ans1` is the return value of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

4. **Analyze the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, making `i` equal to 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains the same (no information about its initial value is given, so it stays as it was).

6. **Consider the postconditions**:
   - The postconditions do not affect the loop head variables directly. They are related to the loop body and the function `func_1`, but they do not change the loop head variables `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` becomes 1.
- `n` remains unchanged.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`max_item_idx` remains 0, `pair_idx` is either 0 or unchanged, `i` is 1, and `n` remains unchanged.**
