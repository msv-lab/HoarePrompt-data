Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`. This means that for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented and checked against `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `max_item_idx` is 2
   - `i` is 2
   - `ans` is `func_1(1, 1, 2, 2)`
   - The postcondition is that `func_1(1, 1, 2, 2)` equals `<`

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to `i = 3` in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (now 3) must still be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` must remain such that `i < n` holds true.

Given these points, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`max_item_idx` is 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is `func_1(1, 1, 2, 2)`**
