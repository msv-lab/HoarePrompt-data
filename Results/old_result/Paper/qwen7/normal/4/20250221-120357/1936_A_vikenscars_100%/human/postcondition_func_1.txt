The function accepts an integer `n` between 2 and 10^4 inclusive. It iterates through indices to find the last index `pair_idx` based on certain conditions involving the `func_1` function. Finally, it prints `! 0 n-1` and returns `None`. If `n` is outside the specified range, it does not perform any action other than the iteration and printing.
