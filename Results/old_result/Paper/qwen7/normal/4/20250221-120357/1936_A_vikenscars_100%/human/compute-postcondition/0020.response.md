State: **`max_item_idx` remains 0, `pair_idx` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `i < n` must be true.
3. Initially, `i` is set to 0.
4. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
5. The variables `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute, so they remain as given.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being 0, `n` being greater than 0, and the other variables (`max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`) remain unchanged.
