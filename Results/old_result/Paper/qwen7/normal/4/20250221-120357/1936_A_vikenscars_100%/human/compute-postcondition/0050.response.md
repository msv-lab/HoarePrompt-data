Output State: **`ans1` is the return value of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`, `ans2` is the return value of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`**.

Explanation: The first line does not change the value of `ans1` but rather uses it as a reference. The second line assigns the return value of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)` to `ans2`. Since the function `func_1` is called with different arguments, `ans2` will be the result of that specific function call. The initial state of `ans1` remains unchanged.
