Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `max_item_idx` remains 0, `pair_idx` is set to the last index `i` which is `n-1`, and `i` is equal to `n-1`. The value of `ans1` is the return value of `func_1(0, n-1, 0, n-1)`. If `ans1` equals `'<'`, then `ans1` is `'<'`. If `ans1` equals `'='` and `ans2` (the return value of `func_1(n-1, n-1, n-1, n-1)`) equals `'>'`, then `ans1` remains `'='`. Otherwise, `ans1` is `'='`.

This means that after all iterations, `pair_idx` will hold the index of the last element processed, and the final state of `ans1` will depend on the comparison results from the function calls within the loop.
