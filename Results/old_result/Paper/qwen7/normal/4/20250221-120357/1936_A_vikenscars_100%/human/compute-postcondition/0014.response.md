Output State: **`max_item_idx` is 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is `func_1(2, 2, 3, 3)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by calling `func_1` with arguments `max_item_idx`, `max_item_idx`, `i`, and `i`. Given the initial state where `max_item_idx` is 2 and `i` is 3, `ans` is now assigned the result of `func_1(2, 2, 3, 3)`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
