Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `max_item_idx` is 1
   - `i` is 1
   - `ans` is '<'

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Update the State**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.
   - The value of `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `max_item_idx` remains unchanged at 1.
   - `i` is updated to 2.
   - `ans` remains unchanged at '<'.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`max_item_idx` is 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is '<'**
