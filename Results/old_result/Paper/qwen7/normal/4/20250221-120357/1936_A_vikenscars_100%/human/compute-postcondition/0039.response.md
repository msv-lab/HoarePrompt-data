Output State: **`max_item_idx` remains 0, `pair_idx` is either 0 or unchanged, `i` is 1, `ans1` is the return value of `func_1(0, pair_idx, 0, 1)`, `ans2` is the return value of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`**.

This means that after executing the code snippet, `ans2` is set to the return value of the function `func_1` called with arguments `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, `i`, and `i`. The other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
