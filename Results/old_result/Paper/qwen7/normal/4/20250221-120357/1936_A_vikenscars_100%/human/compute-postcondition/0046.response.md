Postcondition: `max_item_idx` remains 0, `pair_idx` is 1, `i` is 1, and `ans1` is the return value of `func_1(0, 1, 0, 1)`. If `ans1` equals `'<'`, then `ans1` is `'<'`. If `ans1` equals `'='` and `ans2` (the return value of `func_1(1, 1, 1, 1)`) is `'>'`, then `ans2` is also considered in the postcondition.
