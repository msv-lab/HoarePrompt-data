### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Each query compares the bitwise OR of two pairs of elements from the permutation \(p\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function is used to make a query. It takes four indices and prints a query string, then reads the response from the input.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function aims to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\).
     - It starts by finding the index `max_item_idx` which has the highest single element in the permutation.
     - Then it finds another index `pair_idx` such that \(p_{max_item_idx} \oplus p_{pair_idx}\) is maximized.
     - The logic seems to iterate through the permutation to find the best pair, but there are some issues in the logic flow.

3. **Issues in Function `func_2`**:
   - **Finding `max_item_idx`**: The code correctly identifies the index with the highest single element in the permutation.
   - **Finding `pair_idx`**: The logic to find `pair_idx` is flawed. It iterates through the permutation and uses the result of the query to update `pair_idx`. However, the conditions used to update `pair_idx` are not sufficient to ensure that the final pair \((max_item_idx, pair_idx)\) maximizes the XOR.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_2` does not guarantee that the final pair \((max_item_idx, pair_idx)\) will have the maximum XOR value. The logic for updating `pair_idx` is not robust enough to handle all cases, especially when the permutation has elements with similar high values.
   - The function also does not consider all possible pairs, which could lead to missing the optimal pair.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
