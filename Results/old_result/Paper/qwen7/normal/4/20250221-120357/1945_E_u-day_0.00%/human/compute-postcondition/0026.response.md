Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `mid`, `mid` is `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`, `st` is a set containing the value of `mid`, and the current value of `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`.**

Explanation: The variable `high` is updated to the value of `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `mid` is still `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`, and the set `st` still contains the value of `mid`. Additionally, the condition that the current value of `arr[mid]` is greater than `k` remains true.
