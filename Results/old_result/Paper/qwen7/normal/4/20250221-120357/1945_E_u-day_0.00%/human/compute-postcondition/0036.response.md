Output State: **`low` is `mid`, `high` is greater than 1, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `st` is a set containing the value of `(low + (high - 1)) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `low` is updated to `mid`, which was previously calculated as `(low + high) // 2`. The value of `high` remains unchanged as it is still greater than 1. The value of `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2` after updating `low`. The set `st` contains the value of `(low + (high - 1)) // 2`, which does not change because `low` and `high` are still the same as before the update.
