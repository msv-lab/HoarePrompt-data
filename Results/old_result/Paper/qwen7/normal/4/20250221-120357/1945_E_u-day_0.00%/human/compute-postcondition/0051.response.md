Based on the initial state provided:

- `low` is such that it is either equal to `high` or `low + 1` is equal to `high`. This indicates that the binary search process has narrowed down the search range as much as possible.
- The set `st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the iterations of the loop.
- `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(low + 1, pos + 1)
```

Here, `pos` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but since the context is a binary search, `pos` likely refers to the position where `k` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the array `arr`. Given that `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, `pos` must be `low` because if `arr[low]` were not equal to `k`, the next logical position for `k` would be immediately after `low`.

Therefore, `pos + 1` will be `low + 1`.

So, the output will be:
Output: **low + 1, low + 1**
