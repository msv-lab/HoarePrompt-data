Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to rearrange the permutation `p` using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search algorithm finds the target value `x` at position `l`. The binary search algorithm should find `x` at the start of the final permutation.

### Given Program Breakdown
1. **Functions Defined:**
   - `func_1()`: Reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   - `func_2()`: Converts the output of `func_1()` into a list.
   - `func_3()`: Implements the main logic for solving the problem.

2. **Main Logic in `func_3()`:**
   - **Reading Input:**
     - `n` and `k` are read from input.
     - The permutation `arr` is read and stored in a list.
   - **Finding Position of `k`:**
     - The position of `k` in the permutation is found.
   - **Binary Search Setup:**
     - Two pointers `low` and `high` are initialized to 0 and `n-1`, respectively.
     - A set `st` is used to store intermediate positions.
   - **Binary Search Execution:**
     - The loop continues until `low + 1 < high`.
     - The middle index `mid` is calculated.
     - The middle element `arr[mid]` is compared with `k` to decide whether to move `low` or `high`.
     - The middle index `mid` is added to the set `st`.
   - **Final Output:**
     - If `arr[low]` equals `k`, no swaps are needed, and 0 is printed.
     - Otherwise, 1 swap is performed to place `k` at the correct position.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The binary search implementation in `func_3()` does not actually perform the necessary swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly.
   - The function `func_3()` does not modify the permutation `arr` to achieve the required condition.

2. **Logic Flaw:**
   - The program does not ensure that the binary search will find `x` at the start of the permutation after at most 2 swaps.
   - The binary search setup and execution do not align with the requirement to make the permutation suitable for binary search.

### Correct Approach
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Identify the position of `x` in the permutation.
2. Ensure the permutation is sorted or can be made sorted with at most 2 swaps.
3. Perform the necessary swaps to make the binary search work correctly.

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly implement the solution. It attempts to use binary search without ensuring the permutation is in a form where binary search can find `x` efficiently.

**Correctness: **False**
