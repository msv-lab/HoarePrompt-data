Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the postcondition is as follows: `n` must be greater than or equal to the final value of `i`, which is `n-1` (since `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`), `i` is `n-1`. If `arr[i]` (which is `arr[n-1]`) equals `k`, then `pos` is set to `n-1`. Otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` will be the same as the initial state, and `arr` will retain its initial values.
