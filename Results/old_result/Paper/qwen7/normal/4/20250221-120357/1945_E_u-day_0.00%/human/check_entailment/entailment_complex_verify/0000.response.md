### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function Analysis:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and returns a map object containing these integers.
   - The map object is not directly used in the program; instead, it is expected to be converted to a list in the subsequent function.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function converts the map object returned by `func_1` into a list.
   - The function is not necessary because `func_1` should directly return a list if the input is split correctly.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function takes the length of the permutation `n` and the target value `k`.
   - It then finds the position of `k` in the permutation `arr` using a linear search.
   - It performs a binary search on the permutation to find the position where `k` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
   - The binary search logic is flawed because it does not account for the fact that the permutation is not sorted. Instead, it treats the permutation as if it were already sorted.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:

- The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic of the functions.
- However, the annotated code for `func_2` is incorrect because `func_1` should return a list directly without needing an intermediate map object.

#### Correctness of the Provided Program:

- The original assessment is correct in stating that the program does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm as described in the problem statement.
- The binary search is performed on an unsorted permutation, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.
- The program should sort the permutation before performing the binary search.

#### Corrected Version:

The corrected version of the program should include a sorting step before performing the binary search. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    # Sort the array
    arr.sort()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
    (low, high) = (0, n - 1)
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        st.add(mid)
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
```

### Final Evaluation:

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm as required by the problem statement. Therefore, we should overturn the original assessment.

**Final: False**
