Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and the values of `n` and `k` are the results of the function `func_1()` call.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = func_1()` calls the function `func_1()`, which presumably returns two values: `n` and `k`. These values are assigned to the variables `n` and `k`, respectively. The precondition that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n remains valid, but now these conditions are satisfied by the return values of `func_1()`.
