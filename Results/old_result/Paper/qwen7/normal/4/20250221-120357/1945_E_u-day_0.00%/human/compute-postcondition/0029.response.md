Output State: **`low` is `mid`, `high` is `n-1`, `mid` is `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`, `st` is a set containing the value of `mid`, and `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The line `low = mid` updates the value of `low` to be equal to the current value of `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged, including `high`, `mid`, `st`, and the condition regarding `arr[mid]` and `k`.
