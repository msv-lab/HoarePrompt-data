Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `low + 1 < high`. This means the loop continues as long as `low` is less than `high - 1`.

2. **Current states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `low` is 0.
   - `high` is `n-1`.
   - `mid` is `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`.
   - `st` is a set containing the value of `mid`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `low + 1 < high` must hold true.
   - Given `low` is 0 and `high` is `n-1`, the current value of `high` is `n-1`, and `low + 1` is 1.
   - Since `1 < n-1` must be true for the loop to continue, `n-1` must be greater than 1, meaning `n` must be greater than 2.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `low + 1 < high` holds true for the next iteration.
   - Currently, `low` is 0 and `high` is `n-1`. To satisfy `low + 1 < high`, `high` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `high` is greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`low` is 0, `high` must be greater than 1, `mid` is `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`, `st` is a set containing the value of `mid`**
