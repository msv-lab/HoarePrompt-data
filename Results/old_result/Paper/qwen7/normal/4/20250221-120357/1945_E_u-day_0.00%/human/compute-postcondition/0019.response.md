Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `low` and `high`. `low` is set to 0, and `high` is set to `n - 1`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `pos` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the updated values are `low` is 0 and `high` is `n-1`.
