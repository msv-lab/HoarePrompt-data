Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1()`: This function reads a line of input and splits it into a map object containing integers.
   - `func_2()`: This function converts the map object returned by `func_1()` into a list of integers.
   - `func_3()`: This function is supposed to implement the logic to find the position of `k` in the permutation `arr` using a modified binary search and then perform swaps to ensure `p_l` is equal to `x`.

2. **Function `func_3()`**:
   - The function takes the length `n` and the target value `k` as input.
   - It initializes the permutation `arr` using the list of integers from the input.
   - It finds the index `pos` where `k` is located in `arr`.
   - It performs a binary search-like operation to identify a position `mid` where the element is greater than `k`. This is done using a set `st` to store these positions.
   - After the binary search-like operation, it checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`. If it is, it prints `0`, indicating no swaps are needed.
   - Otherwise, it prints `1` and performs a swap between `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search-like operation is not correctly implemented. The variable `st` is used to store positions, but it should be used to track whether the element at the midpoint is greater or less than `k`.
   - The condition `if arr[low] == k:` is incorrect because `low` might not be the correct position after the binary search-like operation.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program only performs one swap, which is not sufficient to guarantee that `p_l` is equal to `x`. As per the problem statement, up to 2 swaps are allowed.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program does not handle the case where exactly 2 swaps are needed. It only handles the case where 0 or 1 swap is needed.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
    (low, high) = (0, n - 1)
    st = []
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
            st.append(mid)
        else:
            low = mid
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    elif arr[high] == k:
        print(1)
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
    else:
        # Perform up to 2 swaps
        if len(st) == 0:
            print(2)
            print(pos + 1, n)
            print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        elif len(st) == 1:
            print(2)
            print(st[0] + 1, pos + 1)
            print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        else:
            print(1)
            print(st[0] + 1, pos + 1)

# Main execution
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_3()
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. The corrected program ensures that the binary search is performed correctly and handles up to 2 swaps as required.

**Correctness: False**
