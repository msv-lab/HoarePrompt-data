Postcondition: **The final state of the loop will have `low` equal to `high` or `low + 1` equal to `high`, indicating the search range has been narrowed down as much as possible. The set `st` will contain all the midpoints calculated during the iterations of the loop. Additionally, `arr[low]` will be equal to `k` if the condition `arr[low] == k` is met in the if part, and not equal to `k` if the else part is executed.**
