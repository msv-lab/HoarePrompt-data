Reasoning:
1. The program structure is not aligned with the problem requirements. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not defined, and `func_3` does not implement the logic to find the correct positions for swaps to ensure that the element `x` is at position `l` after the binary search.
2. The binary search is intended to find the correct position for `x` in the permutation, but the current implementation does not correctly handle the logic to achieve this through at most 2 swaps.
3. The provided comments indicate that the program does not correctly implement the binary search or the logic to perform the necessary swaps.

Given these points, the program as annotated does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
