Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `low + 1 < high`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `low` is 0
   - `high` is `n-1`
   - `st` is an empty set

3. **Determine the necessary condition for the loop to execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `low + 1 < high` must be true.
   - Given `low` is 0, the condition becomes `0 + 1 < high` or `1 < high`.
   - Therefore, `high` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `high` is greater than 1.
   - The current value of `high` is `n-1`, so `n-1` must be greater than 1, which means `n` must be at least 3.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `high` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n-1` and `n` must be at least 3**, `st` is an empty set.
