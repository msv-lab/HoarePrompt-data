You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to rearrange the permutation `p` using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search algorithm finds the target value `x` at position `l`. The binary search algorithm should find `x` at the start of the final permutation.

### Given Program Breakdown
1. **Functions Defined:**
   - `func_1()`: Reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   - `func_2()`: Converts the output of `func_1()` into a list.
   - `func_3()`: Implements the main logic for solving the problem.

2. **Main Logic in `func_3()`:**
   - **Reading Input:**
     - `n` and `k` are read from input.
     - The permutation `arr` is read and stored in a list.
   - **Finding Position of `k`:**
     - The position of `k` in the permutation is found.
   - **Binary Search Setup:**
     - Two pointers `low` and `high` are initialized to 0 and `n-1`, respectively.
     - A set `st` is used to store intermediate positions.
   - **Binary Search Execution:**
     - The loop continues until `low + 1 < high`.
     - The middle index `mid` is calculated.
     - The middle element `arr[mid]` is compared with `k` to decide whether to move `low` or `high`.
     - The middle index `mid` is added to the set `st`.
   - **Final Output:**
     - If `arr[low]` equals `k`, no swaps are needed, and 0 is printed.
     - Otherwise, 1 swap is performed to place `k` at the correct position.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The binary search implementation in `func_3()` does not actually perform the necessary swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly.
   - The function `func_3()` does not modify the permutation `arr` to achieve the required condition.

2. **Logic Flaw:**
   - The program does not ensure that the binary search will find `x` at the start of the permutation after at most 2 swaps.
   - The binary search setup and execution do not align with the requirement to make the permutation suitable for binary search.

### Correct Approach
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Identify the position of `x` in the permutation.
2. Ensure the permutation is sorted or can be made sorted with at most 2 swaps.
3. Perform the necessary swaps to make the binary search work correctly.

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly implement the solution. It attempts to use binary search without ensuring the permutation is in a form where binary search can find `x` efficiently.
