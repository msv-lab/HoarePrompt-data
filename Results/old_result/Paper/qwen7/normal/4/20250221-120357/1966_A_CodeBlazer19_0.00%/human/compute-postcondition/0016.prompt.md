You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100. Additionally, a list of n integers c represents the numbers written on the cards, where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100 for each i.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(k - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` must still be greater than 0 (since it was initially an integer between 1 and 500, and the loop continues as long as `i < t`). The variable `i`, which starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, will be equal to `t-1` after the last iteration. The values of `n`, `k`, and `l` will correspond to the inputs provided for each iteration of the loop, but since the loop has completed, these values will not change further.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs including an integer `t`, followed by `t` sets of integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `c`. For each set, it checks if the conditions 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100 are met, and returns a result based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
