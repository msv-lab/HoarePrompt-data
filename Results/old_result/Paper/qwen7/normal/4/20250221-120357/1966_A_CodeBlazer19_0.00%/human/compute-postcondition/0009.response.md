Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `n` is an input integer (this variable is not part of the loop head).
   - `k` is an input integer (this variable is not part of the loop head).
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers (this variable is not part of the loop head).

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**
