Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` is an integer input by the user.
   - The value of `t` is between 1 and 500 inclusive.
3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since `t` is the only variable that determines whether the loop will execute, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being greater than 0.

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
