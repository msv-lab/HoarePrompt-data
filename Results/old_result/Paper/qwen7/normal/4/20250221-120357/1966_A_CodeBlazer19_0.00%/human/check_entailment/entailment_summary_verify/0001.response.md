### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of cards left after performing an operation any number of times. The operation involves selecting `k` cards with the same number and exchanging them for `k-1` new cards.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads a list of `n` integers representing the cards.
   - The function then prints `k - 1`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program does not handle the actual logic required to solve the problem. It simply prints `k - 1` for every test case, regardless of the input values.
   - This means the program will always output `k - 1` as the result, which is not necessarily the correct answer for the given problem.
   - The program does not consider the distribution of card numbers or the possibility of reducing the number of cards through optimal operations.

4. **Example Cases**:
   - For the first example case (`5 3`), the program outputs `2`, but the correct answer should be `2` only if the cards can be optimally reduced. However, the program does not check if such an optimal reduction is possible.
   - For the second example case (`1 10`), the program outputs `9`, but the correct answer is `1` because no operations can be performed.
   - For the fourth example case (`10 4`), the program outputs `3`, but the correct answer is `3` only if the cards can be optimally reduced, which the program does not verify.

5. **Function Summary**:
   - The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `c`. For each test case, it prints the value `k - 1`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.
   - The function summary indicates that the function always prints `k - 1` without considering the actual problem logic.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

Final: **False**
