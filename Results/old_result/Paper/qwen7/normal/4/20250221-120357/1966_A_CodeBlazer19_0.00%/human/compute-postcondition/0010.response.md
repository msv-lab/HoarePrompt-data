Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the first and second integers from the input respectively.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
