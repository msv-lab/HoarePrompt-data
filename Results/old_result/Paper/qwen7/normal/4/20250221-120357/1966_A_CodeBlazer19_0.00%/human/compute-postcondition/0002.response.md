Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `n` and `k`. The initial condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0, while `n` and `k` are the integers input by the user.
