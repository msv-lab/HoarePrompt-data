Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers (though `l` is not used in the print statement).

The print statement is `print(k - 1)`. Since `k` is an input integer, the expression `k - 1` will result in an integer that is one less than the value of `k`.

Therefore, the output will be the integer value that is one less than `k`.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is an input integer)**
