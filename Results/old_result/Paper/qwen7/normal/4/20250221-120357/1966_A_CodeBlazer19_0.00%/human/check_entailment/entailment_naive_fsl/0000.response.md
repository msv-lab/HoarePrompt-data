Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. According to the problem description, the goal is to minimize the number of cards by exchanging groups of `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` new cards. However, the provided solution simply prints `k - 1` for each test case without considering the actual distribution of card numbers.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
3 3
2 2 2
```
The correct output should be `1`, because we can exchange all three 2's for two new cards, leaving us with only 2 cards. However, the program will output `2`.

Another example is:
```
4 2
1 1 2 2
```
The correct output should be `2`, because we can exchange two pairs of 1's and 2's, each resulting in one new card, leaving us with 2 cards. However, the program will output `1`.

Therefore, the program does not handle the logic correctly and fails to minimize the number of cards as required by the problem description.
