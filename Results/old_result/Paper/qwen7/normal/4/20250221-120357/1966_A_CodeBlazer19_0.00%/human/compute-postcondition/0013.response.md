Output State: `t` must be exactly equal to the number of iterations the loop has completed, `i` is equal to `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be equal to the total number of iterations the loop ran, `i` will be one less than `t` (since `i` starts from 0), and each iteration of the loop processed inputs for `n`, `k`, and `l` as described.
