Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program currently prints `k - 1` for every test case, which is not the correct approach. The solution needs to account for the actual counts of each card type and apply the operations optimally to minimize the number of remaining cards.

A correct solution would involve counting the occurrences of each card number and then determining the minimum number of cards that cannot be fully grouped into sets of size `k`.
