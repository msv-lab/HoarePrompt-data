Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
