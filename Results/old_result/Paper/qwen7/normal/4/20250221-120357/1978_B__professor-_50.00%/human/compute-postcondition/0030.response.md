Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers t, n, and a, and b indirectly through test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. It returns a result based on the values of n, a, and b for each test case.**

This means the function is expected to handle multiple test cases defined by the variable `t`. For each test case, it processes the integers `n`, `a`, and `b` and returns a result based on these values.
