Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `_` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `b` is the third integer from the input.**

The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\). The variable `_` is unchanged and is still 2. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are now the integers provided as input.
