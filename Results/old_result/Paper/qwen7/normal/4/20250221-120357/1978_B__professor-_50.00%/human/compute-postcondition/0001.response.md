State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is now 1** 

Explanation:
- The variable `_` is used as a placeholder in the `for` loop and typically does not hold meaningful data. However, for the loop to execute, the condition specified in the `range(t)` must be satisfied. This means that `t` must be a positive integer within the range of 1 to \(10^4\).
- The underscore `_` is incremented by the loop itself, starting from 0 up to `t-1`. Therefore, before the loop starts, `_` is considered to be 0.

Since the only variable in the loop head is `t`, and the loop will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, the state needs to be adjusted accordingly.
