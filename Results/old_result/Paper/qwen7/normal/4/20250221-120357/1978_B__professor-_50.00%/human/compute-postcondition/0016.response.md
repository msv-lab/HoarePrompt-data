Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input.**

The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\). The variable `_` also remains unchanged and is still 1.
