The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates and prints one of three possible results based on the values of \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\). If \(b \leq a\), it prints \(n \times a\). If \(b - a \geq n\), it prints \(\frac{(2 \times b - n + 1) \times n}{2}\). Otherwise, it prints \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n\). The function does not return any value but outputs the calculated results for each test case.
