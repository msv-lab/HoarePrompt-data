Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `_` is `t`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `b` is the third integer from the input. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after all iterations of the loop.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will still hold its initial value, which is a positive integer less than \(10^4\). The variable `_` will be equal to `t` because it is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` will retain their values from the last input provided before the loop started, as they are not modified within the loop body.
