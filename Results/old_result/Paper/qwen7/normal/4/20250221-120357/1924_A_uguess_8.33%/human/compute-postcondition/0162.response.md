Output State: **`ss` is the last character of `s`, `cnt` is the total number of characters in `s`, `i` is \(2k-1\), `cur` is 0, `tmp` is an empty string, and `ans` is a string of length `cnt` where each character is `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` to be a string of length `cnt`, where each character is calculated as `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`. This means that `ans` is now a string of length `cnt` filled with the same character, which is the ASCII character corresponding to the value `ord('a') + k - 1`. The other variables (`ss`, `cnt`, `i`, `cur`, and `tmp`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
