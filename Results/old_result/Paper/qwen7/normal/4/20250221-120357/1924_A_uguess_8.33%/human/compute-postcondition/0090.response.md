Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1 + 1 << cur_ss`, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the character `ss` converted from its ASCII value minus the ASCII value of 'a'. This means if the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is 0, `cur` is updated to `(1 << k) - 1 + 1 << cur_ss`. If the bit is already 1, no change occurs.
