Output State: **All characters in the string `s` have been processed, `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached \((1 << k) - 1\), and `i` is \(k-1\), and `tmp` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes `tmp` as an empty string. No other changes are made to the existing variables (`s`, `cur`, `cnt`, and `i`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial state, and `tmp` is added to the list of variables with its new value.
