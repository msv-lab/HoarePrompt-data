Output State: **`ss` is the third character of `s`, `cnt` is 3, `i` is \(2k-1\), `cur` is 0, `tmp` is an empty string, and `ans` is `'a' * (n - 1)` followed by `tmp`.**

Explanation: The line `cur = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `cur`. All other variables (`ss`, `cnt`, `i`, `tmp`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
