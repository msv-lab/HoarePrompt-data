Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur` is the updated value of `cur`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.**

Explanation: The code calculates the ASCII value of the character `ss` and subtracts the ASCII value of 'a' from it. This difference is stored in the variable `cur_ss`. The other variables (`s`, `ss`, and `cur`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
