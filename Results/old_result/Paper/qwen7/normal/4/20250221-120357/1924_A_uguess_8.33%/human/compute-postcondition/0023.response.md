Output State: **`cur` is the original value of `cur` plus 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`, `cnt` is `cnt` + 1, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', and `ss` is the next element in `s`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description. Therefore, `cur` retains its value as the original value of `cur` plus 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `cur_ss` remains the same, and `ss` remains the next element in `s`.
