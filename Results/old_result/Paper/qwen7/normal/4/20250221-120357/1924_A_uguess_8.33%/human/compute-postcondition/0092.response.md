Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1 + 1 << cur_ss`, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the character `ss` converted from its ASCII value minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cnt` is `cnt + 1`**.

Explanation: The line `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. All other variables (`s`, `ss`, `cur`, and `cur_ss`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated value of `cnt` is the original value of `cnt` plus one.
