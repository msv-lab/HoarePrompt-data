Postcondition: **`ss` is the third character of `s`, `cnt` is 3, `i` is \(2k-1\), `cur` is 0, `tmp` is an empty string, and `ans` is `'a' * (n - 1)` followed by `tmp`.**

Explanation: Given the if condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` is not met, the postcondition remains as specified in the if part since there is no else part. Therefore, `cur` is updated to 0, and the other variables (`ss`, `cnt`, `i`, `tmp`, and `ans`) retain their values from the precondition.
