Output State: **`i` is 0; `cur` is an integer where the bit at position `i` is not set; `tmp` is 'a'**

Explanation: The code assigns the character `'a'` plus the value of `i` to the variable `tmp`. Since `i` is initially 0, `ord('a') + i` equals `ord('a')`, which is 97. Therefore, `tmp` is assigned the value `'a'`. The values of `i` and `cur` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.
