Output State: **`i` is \(k-1\); `cur` is an integer where the bit at position `i` is not set; `tmp` is a character which is the ASCII character corresponding to `ord('a') + k - 1`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `chr(ord('a') + i)` to the variable `tmp`. Since `i` is \(k-1\), `tmp` will be the ASCII character corresponding to `ord('a') + k - 1`. The values of `i` and `cur` remain unchanged.
