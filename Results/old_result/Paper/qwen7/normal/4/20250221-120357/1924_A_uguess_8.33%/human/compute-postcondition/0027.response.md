Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `ss` and the loop variable is `s`. The relevant variables in the loop head are `ss`, `cur`, `cnt`, and `cur_ss`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - `ss` is the current character from the string `s`.
   - `cur` is updated based on its original value plus \(2^{cur_ss}\).
   - `cnt` is incremented by 1.
   - `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - If `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\) for some integer \(k\), `cur` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `cur` is updated to the original value of `cur` plus \(2^{cur_ss}\).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `ss` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - `cur` will be updated based on the current value of `cur` and `cur_ss`.
   - `cnt` will be incremented by 1.
   - `cur_ss` will be the ASCII value of the new `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.

Given the postconditions at the end of the previous iteration:
- `cur` is the original value of `cur` plus \(2^{cur_ss}\).
- `cnt` is the current value of `cnt` plus 1.
- `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.

For the next iteration:
- `cur` will be updated based on the new `ss`.
- `cnt` will be incremented by 1.
- `cur_ss` will be the ASCII value of the new `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `cur` will be updated based on the new `ss`.
- `cnt` will be incremented by 1.
- `cur_ss` will be the ASCII value of the new `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `ss` for the next iteration, we can represent it as a general form.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`cur` is the original value of `cur` plus \(2^{(ASCII(ss) - ASCII('a'))}\), `cnt` is the current value of `cnt` plus 2, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`**.
