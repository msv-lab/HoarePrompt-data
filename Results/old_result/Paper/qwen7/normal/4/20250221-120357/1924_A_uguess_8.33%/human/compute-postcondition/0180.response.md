Postcondition: **`ss` is the last character of `s`, `cnt` is the total number of characters in `s`, `i` is `2k-1`, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is either an empty string or 'a' + `2k-1`, and `ans` is a string of length `cnt` where each character is `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times if `cnt` is less than `n`, or `'a' * (n - 1)` followed by `tmp` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
