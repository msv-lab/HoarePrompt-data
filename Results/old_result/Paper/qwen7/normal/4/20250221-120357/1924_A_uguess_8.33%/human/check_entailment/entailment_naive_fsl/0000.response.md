Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. Instead, it checks if all combinations of the first `k` alphabets appear as subsequences in `s`.

Here's a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
3
2 2 4
abba
2 2 3
abb
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

For the second test case (`2 2 3 abb`), the program will output `YES`, but the correct output should be `NO` because the string `aa` cannot be found as a subsequence in `abb`.

The program uses a bitmask approach to track the presence of each character in the current substring of `s`. However, this approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` are checked correctly. It only checks if all combinations of the first `k` characters appear somewhere in the string `s`.

To fix this, the program needs to generate all possible strings of length `n` and check if they are subsequences of `s`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(s, sub):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(c in it for c in sub)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        alphabet = ''.join(chr(ord('a') + i) for i in range(k))
        all_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product(alphabet, repeat=n)]
        
        found = set()
        for sub in all_strings:
            if is_subsequence(s, sub):
                found.add(sub)
        
        if len(found) == len(all_strings):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            # Print a string that is not a subsequence
            for sub in all_strings:
                if sub not in found:
                    print(sub[:n])
                    break

func()
```

This corrected version generates all possible strings of length `n` and checks if they are subsequences of `s`. If all such strings are found, it prints `YES`; otherwise, it prints `NO` and a string that is not a subsequence.
