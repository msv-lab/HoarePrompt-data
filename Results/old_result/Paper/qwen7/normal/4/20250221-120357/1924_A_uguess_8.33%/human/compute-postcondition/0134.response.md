Output State: **`ss` is the first character of `s`, `cnt` is 1, `i` is \(2k-1\), `cur` is \((1 << k) - 1\), `tmp` is an empty string, `ans` is `'a' * (n - 1)` followed by `tmp`.**

Explanation: The line `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` was set to 0. After executing this line, `cnt` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
