Output State: **`le` is the length of list `a`, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is 4, `r` must be greater than 3, `a[2]` is equal to `a[3]`, `st` is 4, `end` is 1.**

The code `st += 1` increments the value of `st` by 1. Given that `st` was initially 3, after executing this line, `st` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
