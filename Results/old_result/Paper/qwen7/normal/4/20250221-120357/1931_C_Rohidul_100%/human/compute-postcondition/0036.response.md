Output State: **`ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the new input split and mapped to integers, `l` is equal to `r - 1`, `r` is now `n - 4`, `st` is the total number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal starting from index 0, `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to an int, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The values of `ans`, `le`, `t`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `st`, and the relationship between `a[0]` and `a[-1]` remain unchanged except for the update to the list `a`.
