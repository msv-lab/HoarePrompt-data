Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `le` is the length of list `a`, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1`, all elements from `a[l]` to `a[r]` are equal, `st` is `le - 1`, `end` is 1.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `l < r` and the elements at indices `l` and `l + 1` are equal. Each iteration increments `l` and increases `st` by 1. Once `l` becomes equal to `r`, the condition `l < r` fails, and the loop terminates. At this point, all elements from index `l` (which is now equal to `r`) to the end of the list are equal, and `st` will be the count of how many times the loop executed, which is `le - 1` since we start comparing from the first two elements.
Code of the loop:
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
    r -= 1
    end += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `end` is 2, `le` is the length of list `a`, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1` and must be greater than `l`, all elements from `a[l]` to `a[r]` are equal, `st` is `le - 1`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `end` is 3, `le` is the length of list `a`, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` must be `n - 2` and greater than `l`, all elements from `a[l]` to `a[r]` are equal, `st` is `le - 1`, `r` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `end` is 4, `le` is the length of list `a`, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r` and `r` must be `n - 4` and greater than `l`, all elements from `a[l]` to `a[r]` are equal, `st` is `le - 1`, `r` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
