Output State: **`end` is 3, `le` is the length of list `a`, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r` and `r` must be `n - 4` and greater than `l`, all elements from `a[l]` to `a[r]` are equal, `st` is `le - 1`, `r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is decremented by 1. Since `r` was previously equal to `n - 4` and greater than `l`, and all elements from `a[l]` to `a[r]` are equal, the new value of `r` is `n - 5`. All other variables remain unchanged.
