Output State: **All elements in the list `a` are equal, and `ans` is `1` if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is `0`.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the conditions inside the loop will continue to reduce the range `[l, r]` until either `l` equals `r` or the conditions to break the loop are met. Given the constraints and the operations within the loop, the final state will be such that the entire list `a` is reduced to a single segment of identical elements. If the first and last elements of the list are the same, `ans` will be `1`; otherwise, it will be `0`.
