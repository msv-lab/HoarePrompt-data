Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `end` is 3
   - `le` is the length of list `a`
   - `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer
   - `l` is equal to `r`
   - `r` must be `n - 2` and greater than `l`
   - All elements from `a[l]` to `a[r]` are equal
   - `st` is `le - 1`
   - `r` is decreased by 1

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - The loop head involves `r` and `l`.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, both conditions `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must be true.
   - From the current state, `r` has been decreased by 1, so `r` is now `n - 3`.
   - Since `l` is equal to `r` at the start of this iteration, `l` is also `n - 3`.
   - Therefore, `r > l` cannot be true because they are equal.
   - To make `r > l` true, `r` must be greater than `l` by at least 1.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure `r` is greater than `l` by at least 1.
   - Since `r` is currently `n - 3` and `l` is `n - 3`, we need to decrease `r` further or increase `l` to satisfy `r > l`.

Given the constraints and the need to make the loop execute again, we can adjust `r` to be `n - 4` (decreasing it further) and ensure `l` remains `n - 3`.

**Final State**:
- `end` is 3
- `le` is the length of list `a`
- `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer
- `l` is equal to `r`, which is `n - 3`
- `r` must be `n - 4` and greater than `l` (now `n - 3`)
- All elements from `a[l]` to `a[r]` are equal
- `st` is `le - 1`

State: **`end` is 3, `le` is the length of list `a`, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r` and `r` must be `n - 4` and greater than `l`, all elements from `a[l]` to `a[r]` are equal, `st` is `le - 1`**
