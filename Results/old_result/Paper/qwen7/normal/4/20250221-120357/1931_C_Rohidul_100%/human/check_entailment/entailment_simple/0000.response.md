Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. It also correctly parses the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization**: The variables `l`, `r`, `st`, and `end` are initialized appropriately to help find the first and last differing elements in the array.

3. **Finding the First Differing Element**: The loop `while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:` correctly increments `l` and `st` until it finds a differing element or reaches the end of the array.

4. **Finding the Last Differing Element**: Similarly, the loop `while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:` correctly decrements `r` and `end` until it finds a differing element or reaches the start of the array.

5. **Calculating Minimum Operations**: The expression `ans = le - max(st, end)` calculates the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements equal. This is correct because `st` and `end` represent the lengths of the prefix and suffix that are already equal, respectively.

6. **Special Case Handling**: The special case handling `if a[0] == a[-1]:` ensures that if the entire array is already equal, the cost is zero. This is handled correctly by setting `ans` to `max(0, le - (st + end))`.

7. **Output**: The program prints the correct result for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program logic appears to be correct and aligns with the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
