Output State: **`ans` is `max(0, le - (2 * (r - l - 1) + end + 3))`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 4, `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, `l` is equal to `r - 5`, `r` is equal to `n - 7`, `st` is equal to `2 * (r - l - 1)`, the current value of `end` is increased by 3.**

Explanation:
- The code updates `ans` to be the maximum of 0 and the value of `le - (st + end)`.
- Given that `st` is `2 * (r - l - 1)` and `end` is increased by 3, the updated formula for `ans` is `max(0, le - (2 * (r - l - 1) + end + 3))`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
