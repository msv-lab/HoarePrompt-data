You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
   - The operation allows us to set a subarray from index `i` to `j` to a value `x`, and the cost is `(j - i + 1)` burles.
   - The goal is to minimize the cost.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The function `func()` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It then uses two pointers (`l` and `r`) to find the longest prefix and suffix where all elements are the same.
   - `st` and `end` are used to count the length of these prefixes and suffixes.
   - After calculating the lengths of the prefix and suffix, it calculates the answer based on whether the entire array can be made uniform without any operation or with one operation.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for finding the longest prefix and suffix where all elements are the same is correct.
   - The cost calculation seems to be based on the idea of minimizing the cost by either:
     - Making the entire array uniform (if the entire array is already uniform).
     - Making only the non-uniform part uniform (if there is a uniform prefix and/or suffix).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases like arrays where the entire array is already uniform.
   - It correctly calculates the cost for making the non-uniform part uniform.

5. **Output Validation:**
   - The output matches the expected results given in the example.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It accurately finds the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.

**Correctness:** True
