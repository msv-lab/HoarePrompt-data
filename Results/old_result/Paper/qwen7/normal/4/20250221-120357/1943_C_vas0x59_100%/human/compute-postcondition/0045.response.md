Postcondition: `d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1, n]`, and the current value of `n` is `previous[path_ba[-1]]`. If `n == -1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged when the if condition is not met.
