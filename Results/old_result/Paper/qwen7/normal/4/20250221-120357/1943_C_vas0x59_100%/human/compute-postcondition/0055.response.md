Output State: **`ci` is 0, `i` is 0, `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c, 0)`**.

In this case, the code appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Since `c` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we cannot determine its exact value. However, given the initial state, `i` is 0, so the tuple appended to `ops` is `(c, 0)`. The values of `ci` and `i` remain unchanged.
