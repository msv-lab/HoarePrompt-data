Output State: **`d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1, n]`, and the current value of `n` is `previous[path_ba[-1]]`.**

Explanation: The code `n = previous[path_ba[-1]]` updates the value of `n` to be the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`. Since `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1, n]`, the last element of `path_ba` (i.e., `path_ba[-1]`) is `n`. Therefore, `n` is updated to be `previous[n]`. All other variables (`d`, `b`, and `path_ba`) remain unchanged.
