Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^3, and a list `u2vs` of length `n` where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree. The function also processes `n-1` lines describing the edges of the tree. After executing the function body, the function returns None.**

This means the function `func_2` takes an integer `n` and a list `u2vs` as inputs, where `n` represents the number of vertices in a tree, and `u2vs` lists the neighbors of each vertex. Additionally, the function processes `n-1` lines to describe the edges of the tree. However, the function does not return any value; instead, it performs some operations and ends without returning anything (None).
