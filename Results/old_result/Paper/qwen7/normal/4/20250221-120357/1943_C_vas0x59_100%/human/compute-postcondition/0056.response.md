Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `ci`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < ci + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ci` is 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c, 0)`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0 and `ci` is 0, the condition `i < ci + 1` evaluates to `0 < 0 + 1`, which is `True`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute again.
   - After the loop increments `i` by 1, `i` will become 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `ci` must remain 0 (since it is not modified within the loop).

5. **Update the state**:
   - `ci` remains 0.
   - `i` becomes 1.
   - `ops` remains unchanged.

Thus, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`ci` is 0, `i` is 1, `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c, 0)`**
