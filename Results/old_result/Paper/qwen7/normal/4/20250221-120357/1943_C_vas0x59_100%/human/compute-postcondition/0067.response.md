Output State: **`ci1` is -1, `ci2` is 0, `c1` is `b`, `d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1, n1, n2, ..., nk]`, `c2` is `-1`, and the length of `path_ba` is even.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `path_ba[ci2]` to `c2`. Since `ci2` is 0 and `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1, n1, n2, ..., nk]`, the value of `c2` becomes the first element of `path_ba`, which is `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
