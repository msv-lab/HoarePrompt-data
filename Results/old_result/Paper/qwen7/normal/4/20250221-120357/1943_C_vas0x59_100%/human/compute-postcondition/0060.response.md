Output State: `ci` is 0, `i` is 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1)]`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = ci`, where `ci` is initially 0. After each iteration, `ops` appends a tuple `(c, i)`. Since `ci` does not change within the loop and remains 0 throughout, the loop will only execute once, appending the tuple `(0, 0)` to `ops`. However, based on the provided output states after the first three iterations, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or inconsistency because the loop should only run once given the initial condition. Assuming the problem intends to show the state after the loop has completed its intended single iteration, the final state would be as described.
