Output State: **`ci` is 0; `c` is `b`; `d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0; `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1, n1, n2, ..., nk]`; the current value of `n` is -1; `ops` is an empty list; the length of `path_ba` is odd.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `path_ba[ci]` to `c`. Given that `ci` is 0, `c` will take the value of the first element in `path_ba`, which is `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
