Output State: **`ci1` is -1, `i` is 3, `ops` contains the tuple `(-1, 3)`**

The code appends a tuple containing the values of `ci1` and `i` to the list `ops`. Initially, `ci1` is -1 and `i` is 3. After executing the code, `ops` will contain the tuple `(-1, 3)`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the precondition that `len(path_ba)` must be at least 2 is still valid.
