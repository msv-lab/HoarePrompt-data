Output State: **`n` is 1, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by 2, `v` is `v-1`, `u2vs[v]` now contains the value `[v-1, u, v-1, u]` appended to it.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `n` is 1.
- `u` is an integer from the input decreased by 2.
- `v` is `v-1`.
- `u2vs[u]` now contains the value `[v-1, u, v-1]` appended to it.
- After executing `u2vs[v].append(u)`, the list `u2vs[v]` is updated to include the value of `u`. Therefore, `u2vs[v]` now contains `[v-1, u, v-1, u]`.
