Output State: **`t` must be non-zero, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in `A`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
