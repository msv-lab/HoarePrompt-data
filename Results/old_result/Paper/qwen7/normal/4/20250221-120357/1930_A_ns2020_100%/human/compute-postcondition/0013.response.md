The loop condition is `while t:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `t` is truthy (i.e., non-zero). At the end of the previous iteration, `t` has been decremented by 1 (`t` is `t - 1`). For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be non-zero.

Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**
