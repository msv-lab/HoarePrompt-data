Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of integers based on the given constraints. It returns either a specific integer or a tuple of integers depending on the conditions provided.**

To break it down:
- The function does not take any direct parameters.
- It processes a set of integers based on the constraints: \( t \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \), and for each test case, \( n \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 50 \), and the numbers written on the whiteboard are \( 2n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} \) where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 \).
- The function's output depends on specific conditions and could be a single integer or a tuple of integers.
