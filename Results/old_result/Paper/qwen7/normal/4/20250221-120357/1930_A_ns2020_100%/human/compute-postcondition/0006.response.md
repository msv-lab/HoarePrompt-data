Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 4999, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so if the initial value of `t` was within the range of 1 to 5000, it is now within the range of 0 to 4999. The values of `n` and `A` remain unchanged.
