Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, and `t` is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, the new value of `t` will still satisfy this condition and will be the integer input provided by the user. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
