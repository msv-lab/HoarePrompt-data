Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be non-zero. This variable is not used in the code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
   - `n` is an input integer. The value of `n` is not specified, but it is used to determine the length of the list `A`.
   - `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers. Since the exact values and the number of elements in `A` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact sum of every second element in `A`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(sum(A[::2]))
   ```
   - `A[::2]` means taking every second element from the list `A` starting from the first element.
   - `sum(A[::2])` calculates the sum of these selected elements.

Given the initial state, we know that `A` is a sorted list of integers, but we do not have the specific values or the length of `A`. Therefore, we cannot compute the exact numerical sum.

Output: **sum of every second element in the sorted list A**
