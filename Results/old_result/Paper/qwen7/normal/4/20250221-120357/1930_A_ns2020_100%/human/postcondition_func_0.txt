The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, followed by `2n` integers representing numbers on a whiteboard. It then sorts these integers and prints the sum of every second element in the sorted list (starting from the first element). After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each case.
