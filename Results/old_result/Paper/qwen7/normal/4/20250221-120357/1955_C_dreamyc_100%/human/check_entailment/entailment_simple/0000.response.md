Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Base Case**: If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all ship durabilities (`sum(nums)`), the function correctly returns `n`, meaning all ships will sink.
   - **Main Logic**: Otherwise, the function calculates `a` and `b` such that `a = math.ceil(k / 2)` and `b = k // 2`. It then iterates over the list `nums` to accumulate the sums `s_a` and `s_b` for the first half and the second half of the list, respectively.
   - **Incrementing `ans`**: For each index `i` in the loop, `ans` is incremented if either `s_a` (sum of the first half) is less than or equal to `a` or `s_b` (sum of the second half) is less than or equal to `b`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic in the loop ensures that the first and last ships are considered alternately until one of them sinks. This is correctly handled by the condition checks inside the loop.
   - The function correctly handles the case where `k` is large enough to sink all ships, returning `n` directly.

4. **Output**: The function returns the correct number of ships that sink based on the given logic.

Given the provided example and the logic explained above, the function `func_1` correctly implements the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
