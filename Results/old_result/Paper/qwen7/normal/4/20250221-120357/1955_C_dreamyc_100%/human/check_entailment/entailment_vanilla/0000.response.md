Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to calculate the number of ships sunk.
   - It checks if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all ship durabilities. If true, it returns `n` because all ships would be sunk.
   - Otherwise, it splits `k` into two parts: `a` and `b`, where `a` is the ceiling of `k/2` and `b` is the floor of `k/2`.
   - It initializes counters `ans`, `s_a`, and `s_b`.
   - It iterates through the list of ship durabilities, adding up the durabilities from the start (`s_a`) and from the end (`s_b`).
   - For each iteration, it checks if the current prefix sum `s_a` is less than or equal to `a` and increments `ans` if true.
   - Similarly, it checks if the current suffix sum `s_b` is less than or equal to `b` and increments `ans` if true.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Sinking Ships**:
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the process of sinking ships. It only checks if the cumulative sum of the first part and the second part of the list is within the limits `a` and `b`. This does not accurately reflect the process of the Kraken attacking ships in the specified pattern.
   - Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that once a ship sinks, it is no longer subject to further attacks. The program should keep track of which ships are still active and adjust the sums accordingly.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program reads and processes multiple test cases but does not reset variables between test cases. This could lead to incorrect results if the variables retain values from previous test cases.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the process of the Kraken attacking the ships according to the specified pattern. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    queue = deque(range(n))
    attacks = 0
    while queue and k > 0:
        if k >= len(queue):
            attacks += len(queue)
            break
        if k % 2 == 1:
            queue.popleft()
            attacks += 1
        else:
            queue.pop()
        k -= 1
    return attacks

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, k, nums))
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect because it does not accurately simulate the process of the Kraken attacking the ships. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
