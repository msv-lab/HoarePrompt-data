Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `s_b` is `nums[n - 2]`, `i` is 2, `s_a` is `nums[0] + nums[1]`, `s_b` is increased by `nums[n - 2]`**.

Explanation: The line `s_b += nums[n - i - 1]` increments `s_b` by the value of `nums[n - i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, `n - i - 1` simplifies to `n - 2`. Therefore, `s_b` is updated to its previous value plus `nums[n - 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
