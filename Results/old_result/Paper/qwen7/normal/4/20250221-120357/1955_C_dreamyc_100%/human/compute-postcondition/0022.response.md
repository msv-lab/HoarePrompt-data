Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is 2, `s_b` is `nums[n - 2] + nums[n - 2]`, `i` is 2, `s_a` is `nums[0] + nums[1]`**.

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given that `ans` was initially either 1 or 2, it now becomes 2 (if it was 1) or remains 2 (if it was already 2). The other variables are not affected by this line of code, so their values remain as they were in the initial state. Specifically, `s_b` is updated to be twice its original value because it was initially `nums[n - 2]` and is now increased by `nums[n - 2]`.
