Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the `func_1` function. The logic used to determine the number of ships sunk is incorrect. Specifically, the current implementation does not correctly simulate the alternating attack pattern on the first and last ships.

To fix this, we need to simulate the attacks correctly. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    
    # Initialize deque with ship indices
    dq = deque(range(n))
    sunk = 0
    
    while k > 0 and dq:
        if k % 2 == 1:  # Attack the first ship
            if nums[dq[0]] > 0:
                nums[dq[0]] -= 1
                if nums[dq[0]] == 0:
                    sunk += 1
                    dq.popleft()
            k -= 1
        else:  # Attack the last ship
            if nums[dq[-1]] > 0:
                nums[dq[-1]] -= 1
                if nums[dq[-1]] == 0:
                    sunk += 1
                    dq.pop()
            k -= 1
    
    print(sunk)
```

This corrected version uses a deque to keep track of the ship indices and simulates the alternating attacks correctly. It decrements the durability of the ships and removes them from the deque when they sink.
