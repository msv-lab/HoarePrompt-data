Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the number of test cases. The program assumes that there will always be 10 pairs of integers (from `i` in range(10)), but the actual number of test cases is specified in the first line of input (`t`). 

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x = int(xylist[0])
        y = int(xylist[1])
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)

func()
```

This version correctly reads the number of test cases from the first line and processes each test case accordingly.
