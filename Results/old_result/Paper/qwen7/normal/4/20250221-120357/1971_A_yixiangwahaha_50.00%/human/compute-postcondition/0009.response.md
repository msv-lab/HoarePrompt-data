Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `x` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[0]`, `y` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[1]`, `i` is 2, `n` is 10, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `xylist = input().split(' ')` takes a single line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on spaces. This list is assigned to `xylist`. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from the previous state.
