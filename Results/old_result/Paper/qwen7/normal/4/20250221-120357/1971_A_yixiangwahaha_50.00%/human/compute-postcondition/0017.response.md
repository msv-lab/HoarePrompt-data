Output State: `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `x` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[0]` repeated 10 times, `y` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[1]` each incremented by 9, `i` is 10, `n` is 10, `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input, and `y` is appended with the integer value of `xylist[1]` nine more times.

This means that after the loop has executed all 10 iterations, the list `x` will contain the integer value of `xylist[0]` ten times, and the list `y` will contain the integer value of `xylist[1]` ten times, each incremented by its respective index position minus one (since it starts from 1).
