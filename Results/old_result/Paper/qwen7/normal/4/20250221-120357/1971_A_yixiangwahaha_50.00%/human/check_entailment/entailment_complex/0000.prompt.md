Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `x` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[0]` repeated 10 times, `y` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[1]` each incremented by 9, `i` is 10, `n` is 10, `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input, and `y` is appended with the integer value of `xylist[1]` nine more times.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all 10 iterations, the list `x` will contain the integer value of `xylist[0]` ten times, and the list `y` will contain the integer value of `xylist[1]` ten times, each incremented by its respective index position minus one (since it starts from 1).
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
        
    #State: `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `x` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[0]` repeated 10 times, `y` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[1]` each incremented by 9, `i` is 10, `n` is 10, `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input, and `y` is appended with the integer value of `xylist[1]` nine more times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` and two lists of 10 integers each (`x` and `y`) from the input. It then compares corresponding elements of `x` and `y`, printing the smaller element followed by the larger element for each pair. After processing all pairs, the function does not return any value.
