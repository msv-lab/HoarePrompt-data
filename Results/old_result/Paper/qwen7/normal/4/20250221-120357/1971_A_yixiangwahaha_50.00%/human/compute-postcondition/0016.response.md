Output State: `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `x` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[0]` repeated 10 times, `y` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[1]` plus 9, `i` is 10, `n` is 10, `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input, `y` is appended with the integer value of `xylist[1]` 9 more times.

This means that after the loop has executed all 10 iterations, the list `x` will contain the integer value of `xylist[0]` ten times, while the list `y` will contain the integer value of `xylist[1]` repeated 10 times, each time incremented by 1 from its original value. The variable `i` will be 10 since the loop runs 10 times, and `n` remains 10 as it was initialized.
