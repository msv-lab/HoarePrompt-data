Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100; `x` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `x`. The value of `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, as no operation was performed on it. Therefore, `t` is still an integer within the range 1 to 100, and `x` is now an empty list.
