Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 4.
   - `x` is an input integer.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < x`. Since `i` is initially 4, the loop will start executing if `x` is greater than or equal to 4.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start executing, which means `x` must be greater than or equal to 4.
   - The initial value of `i` (which is 4) should be consistent with the loop starting.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `x` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`k` is 0, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is 4, `x` must be greater than or equal to 4, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the list `a`**.
