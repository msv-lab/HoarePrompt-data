Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is 2, `ans1` is decreased by `a[i + x] * 2`**.

Explanation: The code subtracts `a[i + x] * 2` from `ans1`. Since `i` is 2, the expression `i + x` becomes `2 + x`. Therefore, `ans1` is decreased by `a[2 + x] * 2`. The other variables (`k`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
