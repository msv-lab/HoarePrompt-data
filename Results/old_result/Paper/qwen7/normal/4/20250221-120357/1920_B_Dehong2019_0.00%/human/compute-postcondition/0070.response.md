Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is 3, `ans1` is increased by `a[0]` and then increased by either `a[3]` or `a[2]` depending on whether `3 + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x], ans` is updated to be the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans1, ans2)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of the current values of `ans1` and `ans2`. The other variables (`k`, `i`, `ans1`, and `ans2`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
