Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The logic in `func_1` does not match the required conditions for the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` where `1 \le a \le n`, `1 \le b \le m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b \cdot \gcd(a, b)`. However, the current implementation does not properly check this condition.

Here's a brief outline of what the program should do:
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, read `n` and `m`.
3. Iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges and check if they satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b \cdot \gcd(a, b)`.
4. Count and print the number of valid pairs for each test case.

The current implementation of `func_1` does not perform these steps correctly. It instead calculates something related to the square root of `n`, which is unrelated to the problem requirements. Therefore, the program needs to be rewritten to properly solve the problem.
