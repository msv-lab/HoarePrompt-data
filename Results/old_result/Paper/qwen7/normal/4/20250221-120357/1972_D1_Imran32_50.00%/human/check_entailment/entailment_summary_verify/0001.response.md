### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the given program is incorrect. Let's break down the issues and confirm the reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never called with the correct parameters. The program reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` without passing any arguments, which is incorrect.
   - The function `func_1()` takes two parameters \(n\) and \(k\), but these are not used in the logic. Instead, it uses `n` and `m` from the input, which should be passed to the function.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The logic inside `func_1()` calculates the number of valid pairs using a specific formula that does not match the problem requirements. It iterates through a range and adds values to `ans`, but this does not account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Correct Solution Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the given condition.
   - For each pair, compute \(\gcd(a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The provided corrected program in the original assessment is indeed the right approach. It iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition correctly.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect as it does not properly handle the input and does not implement the required logic to solve the problem.
