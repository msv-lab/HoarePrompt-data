Output State: `i` is greater than `root`; `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`; `cnt` is the last calculated value of `i * i` which is 16; `ans` is the final value calculated after all iterations, which is `n` plus the sum of `(n + i) // cnt` for each `i` from 2 to `root`.

To explain this in more detail:
- The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `root`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be greater than `root`.
- `root` remains `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
- `cnt` will be the last value of `i * i` used in the loop, which is 16 when `i` was 4.
- `ans` is updated in each iteration by adding `(n + i) // cnt`. After all iterations, `ans` will be `n` plus the sum of these additions for each `i` from 2 to `root`.
