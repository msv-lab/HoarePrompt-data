Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing integers \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \)), and calculates a result based on \( n \). Specifically, it initializes \( ans \) to \( n \), then iterates from 2 to \( \sqrt{n} + 1 \), updating \( ans \) by adding \( (n + i) // (i * i) \) for each \( i \). Finally, it prints the computed value of \( ans \).**
