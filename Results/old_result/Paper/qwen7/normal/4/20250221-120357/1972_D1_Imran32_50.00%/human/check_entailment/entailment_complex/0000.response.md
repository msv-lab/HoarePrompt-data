Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not match the problem statement. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. The provided code in `func_1()` only calculates a value based on \(n\) without considering \(m\) or the condition involving the greatest common divisor (\(\gcd\)).
3. The logic in `func_1()` does not correctly implement the required functionality. It seems to be attempting to calculate something related to the square root of \(n\), but this is not relevant to the problem at hand.

Given the discrepancy between the problem requirements and the provided code, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
