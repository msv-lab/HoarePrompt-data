Let's break down the problem step by step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `i` is greater than `root`.
   - `root` is defined as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
   - `cnt` is the last calculated value of `i * i`, which is 16. This means that when `i` was 4, `i * i` was 16.
   - `ans` is the final value calculated after all iterations, which is `n` plus the sum of `(n + i) // cnt` for each `i` from 2 to `root`.

2. **Determining the Value of `root`:**
   - Since `cnt` is 16, it implies that `i` was 4 because `4 * 4 = 16`.
   - Therefore, `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, and since `i` was 4, `root` must be 4 or greater. Given that `i` is greater than `root`, `root` must be 4.

3. **Calculating `ans`:**
   - `ans` is `n` plus the sum of `(n + i) // cnt` for each `i` from 2 to `root`.
   - For `i = 2`, `(n + 2) // 16`.
   - For `i = 3`, `(n + 3) // 16`.
   - For `i = 4`, `(n + 4) // 16`.
   - Summing these up gives us the final value of `ans`.

Given the above, let's assume `n` is a specific value, say `n = 10` (since no specific `n` is provided, we can choose any value to illustrate the calculation).

- For `i = 2`, `(10 + 2) // 16 = 12 // 16 = 0`.
- For `i = 3`, `(10 + 3) // 16 = 13 // 16 = 0`.
- For `i = 4`, `(10 + 4) // 16 = 14 // 16 = 0`.

So, the sum is `0 + 0 + 0 = 0`.

Therefore, `ans` is `10 + 0 = 10`.

Output: **10**
