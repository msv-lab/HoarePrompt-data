Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The program attempts to solve a different problem where it calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq \sqrt{n}\), but it does not consider the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To verify this, let's compare the program's logic with the required conditions:

1. **Problem Description**: We need to count ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Logic**: The program calculates the number of valid pairs based on \(n\) alone, iterating from 2 to \(\sqrt{n} + 1\) and updating the answer using the formula \((n + i) // (i * i)\). This does not account for the second dimension \(m\) or the condition involving \(\gcd(a, b)\).

Given these discrepancies, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
