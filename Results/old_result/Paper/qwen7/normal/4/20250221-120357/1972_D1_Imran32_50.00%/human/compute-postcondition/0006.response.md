Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(2, root + 1)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `root`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`
   - `cnt` is 4
   - `ans` is `(n + 2) // 4`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `root`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 2 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `root`. Since `i` is now 3, `root` must be at least 3.

5. **State the updated values**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `root` must be at least 3 (since `i` is now 3 and it needs to be less than or equal to `root`).
   - The values of `cnt` and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 3, `root` must be at least 3, `cnt` is 4, `ans` is `(n + 2) // 4`**
