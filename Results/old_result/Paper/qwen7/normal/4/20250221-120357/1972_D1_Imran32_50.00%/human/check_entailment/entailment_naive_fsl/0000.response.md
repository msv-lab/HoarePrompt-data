Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the implementation does not check this condition. Instead, it calculates the number of multiples of certain values within the range of \(n\).

To verify this, consider the following test case:
- Input: `2 3`
- Expected Output: `3` (The valid pairs are (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3))

However, the program outputs `3` for this input, which is incorrect because it does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). For example, the pair (1,2) should be valid because \(1 + 2 = 3\) and \(3\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(1,2) = 2 \cdot 1 = 2\), but the program does not account for this condition.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
