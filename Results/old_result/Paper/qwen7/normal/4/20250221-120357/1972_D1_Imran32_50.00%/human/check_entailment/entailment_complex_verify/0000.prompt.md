You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^6.

    #State: Output State: `i` is greater than `root`; `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`; `cnt` is the last calculated value of `i * i` which is 16; `ans` is the final value calculated after all iterations, which is `n` plus the sum of `(n + i) // cnt` for each `i` from 2 to `root`.
    #
    #To explain this in more detail:
    #- The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `root`.
    #- After the loop completes, `i` will be greater than `root`.
    #- `root` remains `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
    #- `cnt` will be the last value of `i * i` used in the loop, which is 16 when `i` was 4.
    #- `ans` is updated in each iteration by adding `(n + i) // cnt`. After all iterations, `ans` will be `n` plus the sum of these additions for each `i` from 2 to `root`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: 10
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing integers \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \)), and calculates a result based on \( n \). Specifically, it initializes \( ans \) to \( n \), then iterates from 2 to \( \sqrt{n} + 1 \), updating \( ans \) by adding \( (n + i) // (i * i) \) for each \( i \). Finally, it prints the computed value of \( ans \).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the implementation does not check this condition. Instead, it calculates the number of multiples of certain values within the range of \(n\).

To verify this, consider the following test case:
- Input: `2 3`
- Expected Output: `3` (The valid pairs are (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3))

However, the program outputs `3` for this input, which is incorrect because it does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). For example, the pair (1,2) should be valid because \(1 + 2 = 3\) and \(3\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(1,2) = 2 \cdot 1 = 2\), but the program does not account for this condition.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
