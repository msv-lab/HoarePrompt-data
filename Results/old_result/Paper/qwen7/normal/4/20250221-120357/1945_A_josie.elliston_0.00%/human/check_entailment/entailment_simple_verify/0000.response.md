### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and the annotated code. We'll focus on the logic of `func_1` and `func_2` and ensure they handle all edge cases correctly.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function aims to determine the minimum number of tents required for a given number of extroverts and universals.
- The logic in `func_1` checks if the number of extroverts is greater than twice the number of universals. If true, it returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate all extroverts.
- Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents needed using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- The function uses `func_1` to determine the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
- If `func_1` returns `None`, `func_2` returns `-1`.
- Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1`.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
The annotated code shows that the program iterates over test cases and prints the results of `func_2`. The logic in `func_1` and `func_2` is consistent with the original assessment's explanation.

#### Revised Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identified that the current implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` does not handle the case where there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals. Specifically, the condition `if extroverts > 2 * universals` ensures that the total number of extroverts and universals can form complete tents.

Given the revised logic:
```python
from math import ceil
from typing import Optional

def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts > 2 * universals:
        return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret
```

These changes ensure that the program correctly handles all potential cases, including scenarios where the number of extroverts exceeds the number of universals that can be paired with them.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program, with the revised logic, correctly handles all potential cases and produces the expected outputs as per the problem description.
