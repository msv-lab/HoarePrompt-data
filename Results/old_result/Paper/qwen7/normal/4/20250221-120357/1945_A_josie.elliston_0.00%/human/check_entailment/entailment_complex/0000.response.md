### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided code step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes `extroverts` and `universals` as input.
   - If the number of `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, and the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is at least 3, then it returns the minimum number of tents required using the formula `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `None`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` as input.
   - It first calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the minimum number of tents required for `extroverts` and `universals`.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals according to the given conditions, so it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the result from `func_1`.

Given the problem statement, the logic seems to correctly handle the constraints and conditions provided:
- Introverts need individual tents.
- Extroverts need to be in groups of 3.
- Universals can fit into any group configuration.

The calculations in `func_1` and the handling of the results in `func_2` seem to align with the problem requirements. The code correctly handles edge cases where it's impossible to accommodate the participants (e.g., when the conditions for extroverts cannot be met).

### Conclusion:

The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
