Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, particularly when there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals. Let's consider the following case:

- Input: `1 4 1` (1 introvert, 4 extroverts, 1 universal)
- Expected Output: `-1` (since 4 extroverts cannot be paired with universals or introverts to form complete tents)

However, the current implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` does not account for this scenario properly. Specifically, `func_1` returns `None` only if there are not enough universals to pair with the remaining extroverts, but it does not ensure that the total number of extroverts and universals combined can form complete tents.

Here’s a counterexample:
- `extroverts = 4`, `universals = 1`
- According to the current logic, `func_1(4, 1)` would return `None`, and `func_2` would return `-1`.

But in reality, we should check if the total number of extroverts and universals can form complete tents without leaving any extrovert unpaired. For 4 extroverts, we need at least 3 universals to pair them completely, which is not possible with only 1 universal. Therefore, the correct output should be `-1`.

To fix this, the logic needs to ensure that the total number of extroverts and universals can form complete tents before returning the result. Here’s a revised version of the functions:

```python
from math import ceil
from typing import Optional

def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts > 2 * universals:
        return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret
```

With these changes, the program should correctly handle all potential cases.
