Postcondition: **`index` is the position where `a[i]` is found in the substring starting from index `j` in `b`. `a` and `b` are binary strings, `i` and `j` are non-negative integers representing the current indices being compared in strings `a` and `b` respectively, such that 0 <= `i` <= len(`a`) and 0 <= `j` <= len(`b`). The value of `index` is not -1**.
