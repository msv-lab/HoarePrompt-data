Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum prefix of string `a` that is a subsequence of string `b`. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes variables `i` and `j` to traverse through strings `a` and `b`, respectively. Variable `c` keeps track of the length of the prefix of `a` that forms a subsequence of `b`.

2. **Main Loop**: The while loop runs until either `j` reaches the end of `b` or `i` reaches the end of `a`. Inside the loop:
   - It calls the helper function `func_1` to find the next character match.
   - If a match is found (`new_j != -1`), it updates `j` and `i` to point to the next character in both strings and increments `c`.
   - If no match is found, the loop breaks.

3. **Helper Function `func_1`**: This function searches for the next occurrence of `a[i]` starting from position `j` in string `b`. If found, it returns the index relative to `j`. If not found, it returns `-1`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly identifies the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
