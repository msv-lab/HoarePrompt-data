You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer `t` and a binary string `s`. It counts the number of adjacent character pairs in `s` where the characters are not equal when converted to integers. If there is at least one instance where the current character is less than the next character in `s`, it subtracts one from the count before printing the result. Otherwise, it prints the count as is. The function implicitly takes input values for `t` and `s` for each test case and outputs the result for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `count` is initialized to 0. This will keep track of the number of cuts.
   - `flag` is initialized to 0. This will indicate if there is any part of the string where the sequence breaks the sorted order.

3. **Loop Through String:**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` using a for loop from index 0 to `len(s) - 2`.
   - For each pair of consecutive characters, it checks if they are different (`int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1])`).
     - If they are different, it increments `count`.
     - If the current character is less than the next character (`int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1])`), it sets `flag` to 1.

4. **Final Output:**
   - After the loop, if `flag` is 0, it prints `count + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `count`.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Handling Sorted Strings:**
   - The program correctly handles strings that are already sorted (all 0s followed by all 1s). In such cases, it should print 1, but the program prints `count + 1` if `flag` is 0. This is incorrect because a sorted string requires only one piece.

2. **Counting Cuts:**
   - The logic for counting cuts is flawed. It counts every transition between 0 and 1, but this does not necessarily give the minimum number of pieces required. For example, in "1010", the program would count 3 transitions, but the minimum number of pieces required is 2 ("10" and "10").

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly. For instance, if the string is "010101", the program will count 4 transitions, but the minimum number of pieces required is 3 ("01", "01", "01").

### Correct Approach

To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the positions where the string changes from 0 to 1. Each such position will require a new piece. Additionally, if the string starts with 1 or ends with 0, we need to account for these as well.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        # Check if the string starts with '1'
        if s[0] == '1':
            count += 1
        # Check for transitions from '0' to '1'
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if s[i] == '0' and s[i + 1] == '1':
                count += 1
        # Check if the string ends with '0'
        if s[-1] == '0':
            count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the original program is incorrect. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
