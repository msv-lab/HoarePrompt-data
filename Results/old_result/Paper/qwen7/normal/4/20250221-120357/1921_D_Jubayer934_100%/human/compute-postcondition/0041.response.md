Output State: **`i` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `temp` is -1, and `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `ans` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, or `temp`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `ans` is now an empty list.
