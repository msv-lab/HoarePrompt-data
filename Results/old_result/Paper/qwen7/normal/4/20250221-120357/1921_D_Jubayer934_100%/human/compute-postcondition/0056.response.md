Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, and the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. Initially, `i` is 1, so `ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`. After executing the code, `i` is incremented to 2, and the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[1]` is appended to `ans`. The values of `n` and the conditions for `temp` remain unchanged.
