Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `temp` is -1, `ans` is a list containing the first n sorted integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]` takes the input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then sorts this list. Finally, it slices the sorted list to get the first `n` elements. These elements are stored in `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `temp`, and `ans`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `ans` is updated to contain the first `n` sorted integers from the user's input, while the rest of the variables retain their initial or unchanged states.
