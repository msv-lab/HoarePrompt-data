Output State: The loop will execute for all test cases provided. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `ans` will contain the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` for all indices from `0` to `n-1`. The variable `temp` will either be `-1` (if no break condition was met) or will indicate the index where the break condition was first met. The lists `a` and `b` will retain their original states as they are not modified within the loop body.

In simpler terms, after running through all the iterations of the loop, the final output will be the sum of the absolute differences between each pair of elements from lists `a` and `b` for all test cases. The variable `temp` will show the index where the break condition was first encountered, or it will remain `-1` if no such index existed. The lists `a` and `b` will stay unchanged as they are only used to generate the `ans` list.
