Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `temp`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `temp` is not -1.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `temp` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is equal to `n`, the loop will not start because the loop condition `i < n` will not be satisfied initially.
   - Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to be less than `n` for the loop to start.
   - `temp` should be adjusted to be less than `n` for the loop to start.

5. **Other variables**:
   - `n` remains as the input integer.
   - `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of the list `a` and the corresponding element of the list `b`.
   - `temp` is not -1 (this is already given and doesn't need adjustment).
   - `b` is the same list `ans` (this is already given and doesn't need adjustment).

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `temp`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is less than `n`, `temp` is less than `n`**
