Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[-(n-1)]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1, after executing the line of code, `i` is incremented by 1 (making it 2), and `ans` now contains the calculated value. The condition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.
