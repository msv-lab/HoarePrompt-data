Output State: **`i` is assigned the value of `temp`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list that has appended `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, and if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If not, no change is made to the variables.**

In this output state, the variable `ans` has been updated by appending the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. All other variables retain their previous conditions unless specified otherwise by the condition in the if statement.
