Output State: **`i` is `temp + 1`, `temp` is `i`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` now contains `abs(a[i] - b[i])` where `i` is `temp + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no changes are made to the variables `i`, `temp`, `n`, `ans`, and the expressions they are involved in, these remain unchanged.
