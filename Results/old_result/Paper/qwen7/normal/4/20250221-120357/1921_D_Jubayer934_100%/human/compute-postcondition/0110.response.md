Output State: **`ans` is now a list containing the value `abs(a[6] - b[-(n - 6)])`, `i` is 6, and the other variables retain their original states.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[6]` and `b[-(n - 6)]` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is 6, the expression `b[-(n - i)]` simplifies to `b[-(n - 6)]`. Therefore, `ans` now contains the value `abs(a[6] - b[-(n - 6)])`. All other variables retain their original states.
