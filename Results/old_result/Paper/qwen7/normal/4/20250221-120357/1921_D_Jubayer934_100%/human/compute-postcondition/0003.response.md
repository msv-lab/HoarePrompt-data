Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `ans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `temp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
