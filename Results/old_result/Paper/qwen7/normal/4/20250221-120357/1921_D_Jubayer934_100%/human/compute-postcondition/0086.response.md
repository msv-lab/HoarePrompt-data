Postcondition: `i` is assigned the value of `temp`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, and if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change is made to `i`.
