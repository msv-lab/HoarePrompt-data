Postcondition: `i` is 1, `temp` is 0, and `ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `temp`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
