Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - `i` is initialized to `n` before the loop starts. Inside the loop, `i` will decrement from `n` to `0`.
   - `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n` and decrements in each iteration, the initial value of `i` should be `n`.
   - `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `i` should be set to `n`.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

**Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0**
