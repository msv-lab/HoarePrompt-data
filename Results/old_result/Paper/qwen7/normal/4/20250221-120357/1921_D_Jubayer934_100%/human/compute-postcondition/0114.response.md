Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `ans` is a list containing the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` for indices ranging from `6` to `n-1`.
- The variables `a`, `b`, and `temp` retain their original states.

The `print(sum(ans))` statement will calculate the sum of all elements in the list `ans`.

To determine what will be printed, we need to consider the contents of `ans`. Since `ans` contains the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` for indices ranging from `6` to `n-1`, the sum of `ans` will be the sum of these maximum absolute differences.

However, without the actual values of `a` and `b`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `sum(ans)`. Therefore, the output will be a description of the sum of these maximum absolute differences.

Output: **sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` for indices ranging from 6 to n-1**
