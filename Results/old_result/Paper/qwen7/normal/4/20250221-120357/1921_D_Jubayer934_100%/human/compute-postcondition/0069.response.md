Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`. The variable `temp` is also mentioned as being less than `n`, but it is not directly involved in the loop condition.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.
   - `i + 1` is less than `n`, which means `i < n - 1`.
   - `temp` is less than `n`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < n`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - The condition `i + 1 < n` needs to hold true for the loop to continue. This implies that `i < n - 1` should still be true, but now `i` will be `i + 1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `temp` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop condition.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `ans` will still contain the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, but since `i` will be incremented, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `i + 1` will be less than `n`, ensuring the loop continues.
- `temp` remains less than `n`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[i+1]` and `b[-(n - (i + 1))]`, `i + 2` is less than `n`, `temp` is less than `n`**.
