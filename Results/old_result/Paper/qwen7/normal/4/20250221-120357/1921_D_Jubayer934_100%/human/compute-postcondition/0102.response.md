Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list containing the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` based on the given conditions, and `temp` remains `-1` because it was never updated beyond its initial assignment.**

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have executed, `i` will have reached the value of `n`. The variable `temp` remains unchanged at `-1` since it was only updated once, during the first iteration if the specified condition was met. The list `ans` will contain the maximum absolute differences found between elements of lists `a` and `b` under the given conditions, with each element added to `ans` during the respective iteration of the loop.
