Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, and the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[1]`, `temp` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `ans`, and `temp` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was in.
