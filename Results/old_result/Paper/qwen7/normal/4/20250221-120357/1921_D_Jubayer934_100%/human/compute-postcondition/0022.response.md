Postcondition: `i` is 2, `temp` is 0, `ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]` appended to it, and if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
