Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers t, n, m, a_i, and b_i. For each test case, it sorts two lists, a and b, of lengths n and m respectively. It then calculates the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements of these lists, considering a specific condition. If a certain condition is violated during the process, it adjusts the sum calculation. Finally, it prints the sum of these absolute differences for each test case.**
