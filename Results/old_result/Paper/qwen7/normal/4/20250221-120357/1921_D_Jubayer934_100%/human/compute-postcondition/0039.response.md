Output State: **`i` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `temp` is 0, and `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element in `a` and `b` for indices where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) <= abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The initial values of `i`, `temp`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still equal to `n + 1`, `n` and `m` are now input integers, `temp` remains 0, and `ans` retains its original definition.
