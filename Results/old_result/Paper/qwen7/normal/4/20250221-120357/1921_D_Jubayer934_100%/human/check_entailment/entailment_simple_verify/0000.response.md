### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the annotated code and the logic used in the program to determine if it correctly calculates the maximum total difference \(D\).

1. **Input Processing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\), and the arrays \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - The array \(a\) is sorted in ascending order.
   - The array \(b\) is sorted in descending order.

3. **Pairing Elements:**
   - The program iterates through the first \(n\) elements of \(a\) and pairs them with the corresponding elements from the end of \(b\). This is done using the expression `b[-(n - i)]`.

4. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between the current element of \(a\) and the element from the end of \(b\) is greater than the absolute difference between the current element of \(a\) and the current element of \(b\).
   - If this condition is met, it updates the index `temp` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Appending Differences:**
   - The absolute differences are appended to the list `ans`.

6. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - If `temp` is not `-1`, the remaining elements of \(a\) are paired with the remaining elements from the start of \(b\).

### Analysis:

The key issue with the original assessment is the condition check and the handling of the remaining elements. The original assessment suggests that the program does not always achieve the optimal pairing, which is true. However, the logic in the annotated code and the program itself does not fully capture the optimal solution.

The optimal solution involves pairing the smallest element of \(a\) with the largest element of \(b\), the second smallest element of \(a\) with the second largest element of \(b\), and so on. This ensures that the maximum possible differences are achieved.

### Correct Approach:

To achieve the optimal solution, we should pair the elements directly without the need for the `temp` variable and the subsequent handling of remaining elements. Here is the corrected logic:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)
        ans = [abs(a[i] - b[i]) for i in range(n)]
        print(sum(ans))
```

This approach directly pairs the smallest element of \(a\) with the largest element of \(b\), the second smallest element of \(a\) with the second largest element of \(b\), and so on, ensuring the maximum possible differences.

### Conclusion:

The original program does not correctly implement the optimal solution. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
