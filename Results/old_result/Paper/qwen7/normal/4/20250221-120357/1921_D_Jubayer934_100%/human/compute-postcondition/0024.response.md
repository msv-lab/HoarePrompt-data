Output State: **`i` is 2, `temp` is 0, `ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]` appended to it, and `ans` now also contains the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `b[2]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 2, the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `b[2]` is calculated and appended to `ans`. The other variables (`temp`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
