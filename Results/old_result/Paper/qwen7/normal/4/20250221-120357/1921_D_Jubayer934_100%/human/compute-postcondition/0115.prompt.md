Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. a_i and b_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    temp = -1
    ans = []
    a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
    b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]
    for i in range(n):
        if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
            temp = i
            break
        ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))
    if temp != -1:
        for i in range(temp, n):
            ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))
    print(sum(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `temp` is 0, and `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element in `a` and `b` for indices where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) <= abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` contains the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` from index `temp` to `n-1`, `i` equals `n`, `temp` equals `n`, and `b` is the same list `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` for indices ranging from `6` to `n-1`, and the variables `a`, `b`, and `temp` retain their original states.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
