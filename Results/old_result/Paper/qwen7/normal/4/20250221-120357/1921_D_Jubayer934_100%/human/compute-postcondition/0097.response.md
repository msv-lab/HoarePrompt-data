Output State: **`i` is `temp + 1`, `temp` is `i`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` now contains `abs(a[i] - b[i])` where `i` is `temp + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `temp = i` updates the value of `temp` to be the same as the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` becomes `temp + 1` (which was the original value of `i`), `temp` is updated to be `i`, `n` remains greater than 0, and `ans` still contains `abs(a[i] - b[i])` where `i` is `temp + 1` (which is now the new value of `i`).
