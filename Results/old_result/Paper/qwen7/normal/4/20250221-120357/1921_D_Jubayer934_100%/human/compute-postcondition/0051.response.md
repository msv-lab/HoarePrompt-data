Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, after one iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i = 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` remains unchanged.
   - The variable `ans` is not part of the loop head and its state does not change based on the loop condition.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains the same (an input integer).
   - `ans` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop condition.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`**.
