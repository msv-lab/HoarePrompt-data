Output State: **`i` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `temp` is -1, and `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element in `a` and `b` for indices where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) <= abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.**

Explanation: The value of `temp` is directly set to `-1`, and no other variables are affected by the given code snippet. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
