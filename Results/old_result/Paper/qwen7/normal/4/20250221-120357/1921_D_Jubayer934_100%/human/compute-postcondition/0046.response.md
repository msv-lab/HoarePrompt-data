Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `temp` is 0, the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The line `temp = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 0) to the variable `temp`. No other changes occur to the variables or conditions specified in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `i` remains 0, `n` remains an input integer, and the condition regarding the absolute differences between elements in arrays `a` and `b` remains unchanged.
