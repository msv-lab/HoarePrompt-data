Output State: **`p1` is an integer entered by the user, `p2` is an integer entered by the user, `p3` is an integer entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is 2, `x` is 0, `y` is `p3`.**

This means that the value of `y` has been updated to be equal to the value of `p3`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
