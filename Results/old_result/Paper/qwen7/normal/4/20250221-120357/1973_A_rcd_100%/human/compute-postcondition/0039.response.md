Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is true or false, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd with `p3` being less than `p1 + p2`, and `x` is increased by 1 if the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is false.
