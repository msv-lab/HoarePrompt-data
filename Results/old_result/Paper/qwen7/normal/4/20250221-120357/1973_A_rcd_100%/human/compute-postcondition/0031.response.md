Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd with `p3` being less than `p1 + p2`. `x` is either 0 or 1, and `y` is `p3`. After executing the if-else block, if `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is set to 1 and `y` is set to `p3 - 1`.
