Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `y >= x`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `p1` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `p2` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `p3` is an integer entered by the user and must be an odd number.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `_` is 2.
   - `x` is either 0 or 2.
   - `y` is either `p3` or `p3 - 1`, and `y` is greater than or equal to -1.

3. **Determine Which Variables Affect the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition `y >= x` depends on `y` and `x`.

4. **Analyze the Current Values**:
   - `x` can be either 0 or 2.
   - `y` is either `p3` or `p3 - 1`, and since `p3` is an odd number, `y` is also an odd number (or even if `p3 - 1` is chosen).

5. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `y` must still be greater than or equal to `x`.
   - Since `x` can be 0 or 2, we need to ensure that `y` is at least 2 (since `y` is an odd number, the smallest possible value for `y` is 1, but we need to ensure it can be 2 or more).

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `y` is at least 2 for the loop to continue. Since `y` can be `p3` or `p3 - 1`, we need to ensure that `p3` is at least 3 (so `p3 - 1` is at least 2).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `p3` and `y`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`p1` is an integer entered by the user, `p2` is an integer entered by the user, `p3` must be an odd number and at least 3, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is 2, `x` is either 0 or 2, `y` is either `p3` or `p3 - 1`, and `y` is greater than or equal to 2**.
