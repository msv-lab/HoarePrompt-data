Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd with `p3` being less than `p1 + p2`, `x` is either 0 or 1, and `y` must be `p3`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or the most internal if statement. Since no variables are reassigned or altered within the scope of the `break` statement, their previous states remain unchanged.
