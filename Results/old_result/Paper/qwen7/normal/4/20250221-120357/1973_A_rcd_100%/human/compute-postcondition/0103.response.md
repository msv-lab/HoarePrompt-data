To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given states.

### Loop Condition Analysis
The loop condition is `y >= x`. For the loop to continue executing, `y` must be greater than or equal to `x`.

### Given States
- `p1`, `p2`, `x`, and `y` are as follows:
- The loop breaks if `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`.
- Otherwise, `x` is increased by 1 and `y` is decreased by 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: `y >= x`
   - For the loop to continue, `y` must be greater than or equal to `x`.

2. **Break Condition**: `p1 - x <= p2 - y`
   - If this condition is true, the loop breaks.
   - If this condition is false, the loop continues, and `x` is incremented by 1, and `y` is decremented by 1.

3. **Current States**:
   - `p1`, `p2`, `x`, and `y` are as they are after the previous iteration.

### Determining Adjustments
- Since the loop continues based on the condition `y >= x`, we need to ensure that `y` remains greater than or equal to `x` for the next iteration.
- The values of `p1` and `p2` do not affect the loop continuation directly; they only determine when the loop breaks.

### Conclusion
- We need to ensure that `y` is still greater than or equal to `x` for the next iteration.
- Therefore, we need to keep `y` such that `y >= x`.

### Final State
State: **`p1`, `p2`, `x`, and `y` are such that `y` is greater than or equal to `x`**
