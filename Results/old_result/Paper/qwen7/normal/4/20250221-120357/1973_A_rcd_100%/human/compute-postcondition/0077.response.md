Postcondition: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is 2, `x` is 0 (or any value it reached during the last iteration which is between 0 and 4), `y` is 0, and if `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the function does not change these values. Otherwise, `p3` is printed.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts.
