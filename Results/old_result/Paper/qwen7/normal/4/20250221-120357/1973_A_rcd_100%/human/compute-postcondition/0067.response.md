Output State: **`p1` is an integer entered by the user, `p2` is an integer entered by the user, `p3` must be an odd number and at least 3, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is 2, `x` is 1 or 3, `y` is either `p3` or `p3 - 1` and is now `y - 1`, and `y` is greater than or equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code `y -= 1` decrements the value of `y` by 1. Since `y` was originally either `p3` or `p3 - 1` and was greater than or equal to 2, after decrementing, `y` will now be `y - 1`. Given the constraints, `y` will now be at least 1 (since it was initially at least 2). All other variables remain unchanged.
