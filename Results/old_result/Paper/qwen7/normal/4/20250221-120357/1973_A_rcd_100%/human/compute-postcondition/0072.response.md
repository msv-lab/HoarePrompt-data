`x` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `x` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, so after incrementing, the new value of `x` will be 1, 2, 3, or 4 respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p1` is an integer entered by the user, `p2` is an integer entered by the user, `p3` must be an odd number and at least 3, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is 2, `x` is 1, 2, 3, or 4, `y` is either `p3` or `p3 - 1` and is now `y - 1`, and `y + 1` must be greater than or equal to `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to 1.**
