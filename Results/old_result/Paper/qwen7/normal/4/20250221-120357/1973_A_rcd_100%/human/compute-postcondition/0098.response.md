To determine what will be printed, let's break down the expression `p1 - x + p3`:

1. **p1**: This variable is explicitly mentioned but its value is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its exact value.
2. **x**: This variable is also explicitly mentioned but its value is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its exact value.
3. **p3**: Similarly, this variable is explicitly mentioned but its value is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its exact value.

Given that none of the variables (`p1`, `x`, `p3`) have explicit values provided in the initial state, we can only describe the expression in terms of these variables.

Output: **p1 - x + p3**
