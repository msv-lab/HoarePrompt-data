Output State: **`p1` is an integer entered by the user, `p2` is an integer entered by the user, `p3` is an integer entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is 1, `x` is 1, `y` is `p3 - 1`, and `p1 - x > p2 - y`.**

Explanation: The code `y -= 1` decrements the value of `y` by 1. Since `y` was initially set to `p3`, after decrementing, `y` becomes `p3 - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
