Output State: **`q` is a deque containing `ver`, `ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list or array of boolean values used to keep track of visited vertices, and `vis[ver]` is set to 1.**

This means that the value of `vis[ver]` has been updated to 1, indicating that the vertex `ver` has been visited. All other variables remain in their initial state.
