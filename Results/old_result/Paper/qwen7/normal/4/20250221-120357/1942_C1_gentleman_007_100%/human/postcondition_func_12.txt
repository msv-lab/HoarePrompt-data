The function accepts an integer `n` within the range of 4 to \(10^9\) and returns a dictionary `d`. This dictionary contains the prime factorization of the initial `n`, where each key is a prime factor and its corresponding value is the count of that prime factor in the factorization. If `n` is reduced to 1 after the factorization process, the dictionary `d` will be empty, indicating that 1 has no prime factors.
