Output State: **`ver` retains its original value, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one node where `vis[node]` is equal to 0, and `q` contains the node.**

Explanation: The code `q.append(node)` appends the `node` to the list `q`. The initial conditions state that `graph[ver]` must contain at least one node where `vis[node]` is equal to 0, which remains unchanged. The variable `ver` retains its original value, and now `q` contains the node that was appended.
