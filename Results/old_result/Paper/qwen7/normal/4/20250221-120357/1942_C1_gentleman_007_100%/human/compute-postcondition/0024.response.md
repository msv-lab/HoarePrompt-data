The loop condition is `while len(q):`, which means the loop continues as long as the queue `q` is not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, `q` contains all the nodes that were added during the loop's iterations, and all nodes reachable from the starting node are marked as visited.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `q` must contain at least one node. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `q` is not empty.

State: **All nodes in the graph that are reachable from the starting node (initial value of `ver`) are marked as visited (`vis[node] == 1`), and `q` must contain at least one node.**
