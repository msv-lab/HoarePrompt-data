The function accepts three parameters: `a`, an integer; `b`, a non-negative integer; and `mod`, a positive integer. It calculates the result of raising `a` to the power of each bit position in `b` where the bit is 1, all taken modulo `mod`. If `b` is 0, the function returns 1 because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. The final result is stored in `ans` and returned by the function.
