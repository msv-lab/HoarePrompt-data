Based on the initial state provided:

- All nodes that are reachable from the starting node (`ver`) have been visited (`vis[node] == 1`).
- `q` is now an empty queue because `ver` was removed using `q.popleft()`.

The `print(ver, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `ver`. Since `ver` represents the starting node and it has been processed (all reachable nodes have been visited), the value of `ver` will be printed followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function.

Output: **ver**
