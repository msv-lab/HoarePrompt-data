n is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, m is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and l is a list of empty lists with indices from 0 to n. The function `func_1()` is called m times, and for each call, it returns a pair of integers (x, y) where x and y are integers between 1 and n (inclusive), representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. These pairs are added to the corresponding lists in l, effectively creating an adjacency list representation of the graph formed by the chosen vertices.
