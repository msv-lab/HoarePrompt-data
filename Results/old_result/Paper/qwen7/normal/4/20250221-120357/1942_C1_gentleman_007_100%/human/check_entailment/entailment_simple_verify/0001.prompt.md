You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

    #Explanation: The loop iterates over all possible values of `j` from 1 to `m + 1`. After completing all iterations, the variable `j` will reach `m + 1`, and the variable `i` will reach `n`. Each cell `p[i][j]` in the 2D list `p` is updated according to the formula `p[i][j] = p[i - 1][j] + p[i][j - 1] + l[i - 1][j - 1] - p[i - 1][j - 1]`. This formula ensures that `p[i][j]` accumulates the sum of all elements in the 2D list `p` up to the current position `(i, j)`. Given that the loop runs for all values of `i` from 1 to `n` and `j` from 1 to `m + 1`, the final value of `p[i][j]` will be the total sum of all elements in the 2D list `p` up to the last row and column.
    return p
    #The program returns a 2D list `p` where each element `p[i][j]` (with `i` ranging from 1 to `n` and `j` ranging from 1 to `m + 1`) is the cumulative sum of all elements in the 2D list `p` up to the last row and column.

    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `a` will hold the gcd of 0 and all elements in the list `l`. Since the gcd of any number and 0 is 0 (except when the number itself is 0), and given that `a` starts as 0, `a` will remain 0 throughout the loop unless there is a non-zero element in `l` that changes it. However, since the initial value of `a` is 0, and the gcd of 0 with any positive integer is 0, `a` will stay 0 after all iterations. The variable `i`, which takes on each element of the list `l` in sequence, will be the last element of the list `l` after the loop completes.

All indices `i` for which `2 * p` is less than or equal to `i` and `i` is less than or equal to `num` will have their corresponding `prime[i]` value set to `False`. For these indices, `Highest_Prime[i]` will be set to the last value of `p` that satisfied `p + 1 <= num` during the loop's execution, and `Lowest_Prime[i]` will be set to `p` if it was `0` previously; otherwise, it remains unchanged. The variables `prime`, `Highest_Prime`, and `Lowest_Prime` will be fully updated according to the loop's operations, with `prime[i]` being `False` for all composite numbers up to `num` and `True` for all primes, and `Highest_Prime[i]` and `Lowest_Prime[i]` reflecting the highest and lowest prime factors of `i` respectively.

    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `num` will eventually become 1 because the loop continues as long as `num` is not equal to 1. During each iteration, the code updates the dictionary `d` to keep track of the count of each prime factor found in `Prime_array[num]`. The variable `x` is updated to the next prime factor of `num` until `num` is reduced to 1. Therefore, when the loop finishes, `d` contains the complete prime factorization of the original `num`, with each prime factor's count accurately recorded.

    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `x` starting from 2 and checks if `x` is a factor of `n`. If `x` divides `n` evenly, it updates the dictionary `d` to keep track of the count of divisions by `x` and then reduces `n` by dividing it by `x`. This process repeats until `x * x` is no longer less than or equal to `n`. Since the loop increments `x` to the next integer each time, it will eventually check all integers up to the largest prime factor of `n`. Once `x` exceeds the largest prime factor and `n` is reduced to 1 (since all factors have been divided out), the loop terminates. At this point, `d` will contain the prime factorization of the initial `n`, with each prime factor's count as its value.

    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be set to `n + 1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n` inclusive. The list `f` will have been updated to include the factorial of each integer from `0` to `n`, modulo `mod`, as specified by the loop body.

All other cells in the `dp` table will reflect the lengths of common subsequences up to the indices `i-1` and `j-1` of lists `a` and `b`, respectively.
    i, j = len(a), len(b)
    l = []
    while i != 0 and j != 0:
        if dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1]:
            j -= 1
        elif dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
            l.append(a[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `i` and `j` are both zero, and `l` is a list containing elements from `a` that correspond to the path traced by decrementing `i` and `j` according to the conditions inside the loop until both `i` and `j` reach zero.
    #
    #In more detail, the loop continues to run as long as both `i` and `j` are non-zero. Each iteration of the loop either decrements `i` and/or `j` based on the comparison of `dp[i][j]` with its neighboring cells (`dp[i][j - 1]` and `dp[i - 1][j]`). The list `l` accumulates elements from `a` corresponding to the indices where `i` was decremented. Once both `i` and `j` become zero, the loop terminates, leaving `i` and `j` as zero and `l` as the final list constructed during the loop's execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine if the code correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves a regular polygon with `n` sides, where Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices. We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by choosing up to `y` additional vertices. Since `y = 0` in this version, we do not need to choose any additional vertices.

### Key Points
1. **Vertices and Triangles**: In a polygon with `n` vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `n-2`.
2. **Given Constraints**: 
   - `n` is the number of sides of the polygon.
   - `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has already chosen.
   - `y = 0`, meaning no additional vertices can be chosen.

### Solution Approach
Since `y = 0`, the number of triangles that can be formed is simply the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles in a polygon with `n` vertices, which is `n-2`.

### Code Analysis
The provided code does not contain any function that directly addresses the problem. Instead, it includes a large number of utility functions that are not relevant to solving this specific problem. Here is a simplified approach to solve the problem:

```python
def solve_polygon_triangles(n, x, y):
    # Since y = 0, we don't need to choose any additional vertices
    # The maximum number of non-intersecting triangles is n-2
    return max(0, n - 2)

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print(solve_polygon_triangles(n, x, y))
```

### Verification
Given the problem constraints and the solution approach, let's verify the correctness of the simplified solution:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 8`, `x = 4`, `y = 0`
   - Maximum number of non-intersecting triangles: `8 - 2 = 6`
   - Expected output: `6`

2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 8`, `x = 8`, `y = 0`
   - Maximum number of non-intersecting triangles: `8 - 2 = 6`
   - Expected output: `6`

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 4`, `x = 2`, `y = 0`
   - Maximum number of non-intersecting triangles: `4 - 2 = 2`
   - Expected output: `2`

### Conclusion
The provided code does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem. However, the problem can be solved with a simple formula `max(0, n - 2)`.

Therefore, the given code is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
