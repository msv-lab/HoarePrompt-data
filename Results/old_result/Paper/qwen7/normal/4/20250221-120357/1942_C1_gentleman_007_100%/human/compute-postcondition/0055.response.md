Output State: **`vis[node]` is set to 1, `graph[ver]' contains the node that was appended to the queue q'**.

Explanation: The code `vis[node] = 1` sets the value of `vis[node]` to 1, indicating that the node has been visited. The initial state mentions that `graph[ver]' contains the node that was appended to the queue `q', which remains unchanged by the given code.
