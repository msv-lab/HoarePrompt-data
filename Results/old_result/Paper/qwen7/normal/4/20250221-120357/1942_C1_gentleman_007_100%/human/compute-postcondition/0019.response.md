Output State: **`q` contains `node` and `ver`, `ver` is unchanged, `graph` is unchanged, `vis[ver]` is 1, `vis[node]` is 1**

Explanation: The code `q.append(node)` appends the value of `node` to the list `q`. Initially, `q` contains `node` and `ver`, so after appending `node`, `q` will contain `node` twice. However, since the question asks for the specific values, we can say that `q` now contains both `node` and `ver`. The values of `ver`, `graph`, `vis[ver]`, and `vis[node]` remain unchanged, with `vis[ver]` being 1 and `vis[node]` being 0 in the next iteration but becomes 1 after this operation.
