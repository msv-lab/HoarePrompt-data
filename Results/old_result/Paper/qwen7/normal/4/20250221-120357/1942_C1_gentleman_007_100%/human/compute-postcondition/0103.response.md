Functionality: **The function accepts a string `a` and a list of integers `b`. It calculates the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the string `a` and the sequence represented by the list `b`. After constructing a list `l` containing elements from `a` that form part of the LCS, it reverses the list `l` and returns the reversed string.**
