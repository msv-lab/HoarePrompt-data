Output State: **`q` is a deque containing the remaining elements after removing the first element, `ver` is the first element that was removed from the deque, `graph` is unchanged, `vis[ver]` is set to 1, and `vis` is unchanged except for the element at index `ver` which is now 1, and `graph[ver]` must contain at least one element, and `q` now contains the node `node`.**

This means that the deque `q` has appended the node `node` to itself, while all other conditions remain unchanged.
