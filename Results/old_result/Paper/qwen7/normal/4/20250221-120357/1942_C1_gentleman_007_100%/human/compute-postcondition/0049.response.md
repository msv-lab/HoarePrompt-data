Output State: **`graph[ver]` must contain at least one node, `node` is not visited (`vis[node]` is False), `q` contains the node**.

Explanation: The code `q.append(node)` appends the `node` to the list `q`. Since `node` is not visited (`vis[node]` is False) and `graph[ver]` must contain at least one node, the only changes are that `q` now includes the `node`. The other conditions remain unchanged.
