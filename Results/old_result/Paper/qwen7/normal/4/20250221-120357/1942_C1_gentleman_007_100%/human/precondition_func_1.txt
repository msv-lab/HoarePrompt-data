t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y = 0; the input for each test case consists of x distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, where each integer is in the range from 1 to n; the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
