The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the count of unique, sorted elements from `arr`. It achieves this by iterating through each element in `arr`, maintaining a sorted list `l` of encountered elements, and updating `l` to ensure it remains sorted. Finally, it returns the length of `l`, which represents the number of unique elements in the original list `arr`.
