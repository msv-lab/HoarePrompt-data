Output State: **`cnt` is the total number of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` differ, `i` is `n`, `n` is the final value it was set to after the loop condition was no longer met, `s1` is the number of '1's in the input string `s`, `t1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `t`, `i` is `n`, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, and `s1` is not equal to `t1`, `d` is calculated as `abs(s1 - t1)`**

In this case, the code calculates the absolute difference `d` between the number of '1's in the input string `s` (`s1`) and the number of '1's in the newly input string `t` (`t1`). Since `s1` is not equal to `t1`, `d` is now the specific value of `abs(s1 - t1)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
