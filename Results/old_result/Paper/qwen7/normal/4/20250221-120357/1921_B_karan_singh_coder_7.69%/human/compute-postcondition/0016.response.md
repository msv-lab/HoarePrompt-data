Based on the initial state provided:

- `cnt` is 6.
- `s1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`.
- `n` is equal to 4.
- `s` is an input string.
- `t1` is the number of '1's in the string `t`.
- `i` is 4.
- The number of '1's in `s` is equal to the number of '1's in `t`.

The print statement is `print(s1 if cnt else 0)`.

Here, the expression `s1 if cnt else 0` is evaluated as follows:
- Since `cnt` is 6 (which is a non-zero value), the expression evaluates to `s1`.
- `s1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the number of '1's in the string `s`.

Output: **s1 (the number of '1's in the string s)**
