Output State: **`cnt` is 4, `s1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `t1` is the number of '1's in the string `t`, `i` is 3**

Explanation: The code `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments `cnt` by 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the character at the same index in string `t`. Given that `i` is 3, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `s[3]` is not equal to `t[3]`. Since `cnt` was initially 2, it becomes 4 after the increment. All other variables remain unchanged.
