Output State: **`cnt` is 6, `s1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `t1` is the number of '1's in the string `t`, `i` is 8, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (which must be a positive integer) to the variable `n`. The other variables (`cnt`, `s1`, `s`, `t1`, `i`, and `d`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
