Output State: **`cnt` is the total number of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` differ, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `s`, `t1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `t`, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, `s` is the newly input string, `t` is the newly input string `t`, `s1` is updated to the count of '1's in string `s`.**

Explanation: The code `s1 = s.count('1')` counts the number of '1's in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `s1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
