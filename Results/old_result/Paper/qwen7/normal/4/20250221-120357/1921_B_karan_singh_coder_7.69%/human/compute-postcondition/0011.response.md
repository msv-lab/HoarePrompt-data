Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n):` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is 2
   - `s1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `s` is an input string
   - `t1` is the number of '1's in the string `t`
   - `i` is 2

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as there is no information suggesting it should change.

5. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `cnt` remains 2 (unchanged)
   - `s1` remains the number of '1's in the string `s` (unchanged)
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 (unchanged)
   - `s` remains the input string (unchanged)
   - `t1` remains the number of '1's in the string `t` (unchanged)
   - `i` is now 3

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`cnt` is 2, `s1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `t1` is the number of '1's in the string `t`, `i` is 3**
