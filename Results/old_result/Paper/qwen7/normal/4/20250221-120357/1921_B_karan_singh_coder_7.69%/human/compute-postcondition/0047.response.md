Output State: **`t1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `t`, `s1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `s`, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, `s` is the newly input string, `t` is the newly input string `t`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t1` to be the count of '1's in the string `t` using the `count` method. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
