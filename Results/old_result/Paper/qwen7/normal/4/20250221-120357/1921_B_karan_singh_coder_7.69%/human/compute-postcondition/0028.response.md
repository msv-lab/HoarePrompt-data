Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Identify the variables in the loop head:
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n):`
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. Determine the initial values of these variables:
   - From the given state, `i` is 8.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. Understand the condition for the loop to execute:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Initially, `i` is 8, so the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 8.

4. Adjust the states accordingly:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is less than `n` for the loop to execute.
   - Since `i` is 8, `n` must be greater than 8.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

State: **`i` is 8, `n` must be greater than 8**
