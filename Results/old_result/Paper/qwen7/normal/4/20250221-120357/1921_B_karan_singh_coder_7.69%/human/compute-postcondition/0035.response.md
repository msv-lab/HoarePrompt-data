Output State: `cnt` is the total number of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` differ, `i` is `n`, `n` is the final value it was set to after the loop condition was no longer met, `s1` is the number of '1's in the input string `s`, `t1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `t`, `i` is `n`, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, meaning `i` has reached or exceeded `n`. The variable `cnt` holds the total count of differing positions between strings `s` and `t` for all iterations from 0 to `n-1`. The other variables (`s1`, `t1`, `i`, `d`) remain as they were last updated outside the loop or are not affected by the loop itself.
