Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the game's final score based on the optimal strategies of both players.
2. The annotated program does not correctly implement the game logic. Specifically, it does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as described in the problem statement.
3. The program directly finds the smallest missing integer in the array without considering the turns of the players.
4. The program does not account for the fact that Alice can strategically pick elements to ensure a higher MEX, and Bob will try to minimize it.
5. The program also does not handle the different rules for Alice and Bob (Alice can pick and append, Bob only picks and removes).

Given these points, the annotated program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
