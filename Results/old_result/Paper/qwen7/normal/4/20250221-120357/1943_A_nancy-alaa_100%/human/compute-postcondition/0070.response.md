Output State: **`i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the value of `i`, but it indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Since no loop or if statement was specified in the initial state, the only thing we can conclude is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
