Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game described. Specifically, it does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob and the optimal strategy they would employ. The program simply checks for the presence of each integer from 0 to \( n \) in the array and prints the first integer that is not present. This approach does not consider the sequence of moves made by Alice and Bob or the fact that Alice always picks an element from \( a \) and appends it to \( c \), while Bob only deletes elements from \( a \).

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```

Expected output:
```
2
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0
```

This is incorrect because the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob would lead to a different result. In the given example, Alice could pick the first 0, making \( c = [0] \) and \( a = [0, 1, 1] \). Then Bob would pick the remaining 0, making \( a = [1, 1] \). Alice could then pick one of the 1s, making \( c = [0, 1] \) and \( a = [1] \). Finally, Bob would pick the last 1, leaving \( c = [0, 1] \). The MEX of \( c = [0, 1] \) is 2, which matches the expected output.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the game rules and does not account for the optimal play by both players.
