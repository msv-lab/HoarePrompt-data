Postcondition: `first` is `False`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `mpp` is a `Counter` object containing the counts of each element in `arr`, and if `i` is a key in `mpp` with a count of 1 and `first` is `False`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
