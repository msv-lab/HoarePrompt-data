Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `first` remains `False`: This means the variable `first` is set to `False`.
   - `i` is `2`: The variable `i` is set to the integer `2`.
   - If `i` (which is `2`) is not in the keys of `mpp`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[2]` equals `1`, then `first` becomes `True`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

Given the initial state:
- Since `i` is explicitly stated to be `2`, we know the value of `i` is `2`.
- The condition `if i (which is 2) is not in the keys of mpp` is not relevant because the value of `i` is `2`, and the code snippet does not show any further checks or modifications after this point.

Therefore, when the `print(i)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `i`, which is `2`.

Output: **2**
