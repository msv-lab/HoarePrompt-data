Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 0
   - Either `first` is False or `mpp[i]` (which is `mpp[0]`) equals 1

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute again, the condition `i < n + 1` must be true.

4. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is currently 0
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 0

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Given that `i` becomes 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `n` must remain greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to continue.

7. **Final State**:
   - `i` is now 1
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
   - The conditions for `first` and `mpp[i]` (now `mpp[1]`) do not change until the loop body is executed, but they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
