Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `first` is `False`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each integer in `arr`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if i not in mpp.keys():
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1:
        first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `first` is False, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer. If `mpp[i]` is equal to 1, `first` remains False. Otherwise, the condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement is not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `first` remains False, `i` is 1, and if `i` (which is 1) is not in the keys of `mpp`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` equals 1, then `first` becomes True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `first` remains False, `i` is 2, and if `mpp[2]` equals 1 and `first` is False, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[2]` does not equal 1, the program continues as normal without changing the values of `first` and `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
