Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `first` is False, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if i not in mpp.keys():
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1:
        first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and either `first` is False or `mpp[i]` equals 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, `mpp[i]` is not equal to 1, or `first` is false, the program continues without breaking. Otherwise, `first` is set to True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `first` remains unchanged. If `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` does not equal 1 or `first` is false, no change occurs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
