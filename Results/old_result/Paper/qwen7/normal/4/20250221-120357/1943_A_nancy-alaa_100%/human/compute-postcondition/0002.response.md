Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to an integer type using `map(int, ...)` and then converts the map object to a list. The resulting list is assigned to `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
