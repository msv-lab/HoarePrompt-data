Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `False`
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object containing the counts of each element in `arr`

The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`.

Given that `i` is defined as `n + 1`, where `n` is an input integer, the value of `i` will be one more than the input integer `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **n + 1**
