You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: The loop will execute until `r` reaches `n-1`. After all iterations, the following will be true:
    #- `r` will be equal to `n-1`.
    #- `ans` will contain the total number of times the condition `len(done) >= k` was met during the loop's execution.
    #- The sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` will reflect the final state of these sets after processing all elements from index `m` to `n-1` in the list `a` according to the rules specified in the loop body.
    #
    #All integers in `todo` have been processed and either moved to `done` or added to `extra`. The final value of `ans` will be the cumulative count of times the condition `len(done) >= k` was satisfied throughout the entire loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes integers t, n, m, and k, and lists a (of length n) and b (of length m) as inputs. It maintains three sets: todo, done, and extra. It iterates through the list a from index m to n-1, updating these sets based on certain conditions. Finally, it prints the total number of times the condition `len(done) >= k` is met during the iteration.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the logic for updating the sets `done` and `extra` is flawed. The program incorrectly handles the transition between sliding the window over the array `a`. 

Consider the following example:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  7 4 3
  4 1 2 3 4 5 6
  1 2 3 4
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  3
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  4
  ```

In this case, the program incorrectly counts the number of good subsegments. The subsegments starting at positions 1, 2, and 3 are indeed good, but the subsegment starting at position 4 is not good because it only has two matches (1 and 2), which is less than the required 3 matches. However, the program incorrectly counts this subsegment as good.

The issue lies in the logic where the program checks if the current subsegment is good after updating the sets `done` and `extra`. The program should ensure that the subsegment has at least `k` elements from `todo`, but it fails to do so accurately.

To fix this, the program needs to properly track the count of elements from `b` within the current window and ensure that the count is at least `k` before incrementing the answer.
