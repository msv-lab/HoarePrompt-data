Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is the integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers excluding `a[j]`, `done` is either a set containing `a[0]` or an empty set, `extra` is either an empty set or a set containing the element `a[1]` if `a[j_end_prev + 1]` is not in `todo`, otherwise it does not contain `a[j_end_prev + 1]`**

Explanation: The line `todo.remove(a[j])` removes the element `a[j]` from the set `todo`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `todo` is updated to exclude `a[j]`, while the values of `a`, `m`, `k`, `done`, and `extra` remain as they were in the initial state.
