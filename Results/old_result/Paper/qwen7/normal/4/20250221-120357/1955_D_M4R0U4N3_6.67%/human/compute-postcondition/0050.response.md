Output State: **`r` is `m`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`, `extra` contains `a[r]`, if `old` is no longer in `extra`, then either `old` is not removed from `done` and not added to `todo`, or no changes occur to `done` and `todo`.**

Explanation: The code `extra.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. This does not affect the values of `r`, `m`, `n`, `old`, `done`, or `todo`. The condition about `old` remains unchanged as well.
