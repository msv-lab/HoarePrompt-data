Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, the number of iterations left to execute is one less than the previous iteration, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if a[j] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[j])
        done.add(a[j])
    else:
        extra.add(a[j])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is the integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is either a set containing `a[0]` or an empty set, `extra` is either an empty set or a set containing the element `a[j]`, and `j` is either 1 or 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is the integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is either a set containing `a[0]` or an empty set, and `extra` is either an empty set or a set containing the element `a[j]` where `j` is 1. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `extra` does not contain `a[j]`; otherwise, `extra` contains the element `a[1]`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is the integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is either a set containing `a[j]` or `a[0]` depending on whether `a[j]` is in `todo`, `extra` is either an empty set or a set containing the element `a[1]` if `a[j_end_prev + 1]` is not in `todo`, otherwise it does not contain `a[j_end_prev + 1]`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
