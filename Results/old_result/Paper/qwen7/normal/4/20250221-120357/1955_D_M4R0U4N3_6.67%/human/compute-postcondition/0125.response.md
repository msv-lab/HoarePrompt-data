Output State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `ans` is 0, `r` is `m`, `extra` does not contain `old`, the first condition that `r` must be less than `n` still holds, and `old` is in `extra` no longer applies.**

Explanation: The code removes the element `old` from the list `extra`. Since `old` was previously in `extra`, after executing `extra.remove(old)`, `old` is no longer in `extra`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
