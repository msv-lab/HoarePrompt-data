Postcondition: `r` is either `r_end + 3` or `r_end + 4`, `old` is now in `todo`, `ans` is increased by 1, `extra` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `extra` or `todo`, `todo` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `done` or `todo` if `len(done) >= k`.

This means that after executing the if-else block, `r` remains either `r_end + 3` or `r_end + 4`. Regardless of the condition in the if statement, `old` is moved to `todo`, `ans` is incremented by 1, and the states of `extra` and `todo` are updated based on the original conditions provided.
