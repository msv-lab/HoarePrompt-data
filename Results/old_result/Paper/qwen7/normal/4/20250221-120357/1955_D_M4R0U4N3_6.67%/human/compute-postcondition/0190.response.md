Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values, `ans` retains its original value, `r` is equal to `n - 2`, `todo` is a set of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The line `extra = set()` creates an empty set named `extra`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `a`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `ans`, `r`, `todo`, and `done` remain unchanged.
