Output State: **`r` is `m`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[r - m]` to the variable `old`. Since `r` is equal to `m`, the expression `r - m` evaluates to 0. Therefore, `old` takes the value of `a[0]`. The values of `r`, `m`, and `n` remain unchanged.
