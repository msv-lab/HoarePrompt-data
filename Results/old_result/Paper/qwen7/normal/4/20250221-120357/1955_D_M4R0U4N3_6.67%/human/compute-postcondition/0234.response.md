Output State: **`extra` contains the element `a[r]`, `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` is found in `extra`, then `old` is no longer in `extra`. If `old` is found in `done`, then `old` is added to `todo`. If `old` is not in `done`, then `old` remains unchanged in `todo`. Additionally, `a[r]` is not in `todo`.**

Explanation: The code adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. This does not affect the values of `old`, `done`, or `todo` directly, but it impacts the conditions specified in the postconditions. Specifically, `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`, and the subsequent conditions about `old` being in `extra`, `done`, or `todo` remain as stated.
