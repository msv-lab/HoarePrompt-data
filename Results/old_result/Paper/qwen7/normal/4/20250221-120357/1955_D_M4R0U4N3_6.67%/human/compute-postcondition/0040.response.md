Postcondition: `r` is `m`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`, `old` is not in `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, then `old` is no longer in `done`, and `todo` contains `old`. Otherwise, nothing changes regarding `old`'s presence in `done` or `todo`.
