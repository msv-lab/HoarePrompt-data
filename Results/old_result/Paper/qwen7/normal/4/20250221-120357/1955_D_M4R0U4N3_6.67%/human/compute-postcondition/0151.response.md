Output State: **`ans` is 2, `r` is `m + 1`, `extra` has had `old` removed from it**

Explanation: The variable `ans` remains unchanged with the value 2. The variable `r` remains unchanged with the value `m + 1`. The variable `old` was equal to `a[r - m]`, but since `extra.remove(old)` is executed, `old` is no longer in the list `extra`.
