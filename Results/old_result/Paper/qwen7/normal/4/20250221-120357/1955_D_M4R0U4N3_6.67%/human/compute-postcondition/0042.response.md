Postcondition: `r` is `m`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` is no longer in `extra`, then `old` is not in `extra`. Additionally, if `old` is in `done`, `old` is removed from `done` and `todo` contains `old`. If `old` is not in `done`, no changes occur to `done` and `todo`.
