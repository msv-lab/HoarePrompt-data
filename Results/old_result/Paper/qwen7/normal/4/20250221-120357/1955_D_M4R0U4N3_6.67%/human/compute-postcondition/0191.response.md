Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head defines the variable `j` and the range `m`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j` and `m`**:
   - `j` is the loop variable and starts at 0 (the default starting point for `range(m)`).
   - `m` is a value that retains its original value from the program state before the loop.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m`.
   - Initially, `j` is 0, and `m` retains its original value.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and the loop will execute as long as `j < m`, we need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. This means `m` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `m`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values, `ans` retains its original value, `r` is equal to `n - 2`, `todo` is a set of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set, `j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**
