Output State: **`extra` is the list without the element `old`, which was equal to `a[r - m]`.**

Explanation: The code removes the element `old` from the list `extra`. Since `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, after executing `extra.remove(old)`, `old` is no longer in the list `extra`. All other variables remain unchanged.
