Output State: **`r` is either `r_end + 3` or `r_end + 4`, `old` is now in `todo`, `ans` is increased by 1, `extra` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `extra` or `todo`, `todo` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `done` or `todo` if `len(done) >= k`.**

Explanation: The code adds `old` to the set `todo`. This means that `old` is now included in `todo`. The other variables (`r`, `ans`, `extra`, `todo`, and the condition regarding `done`) are updated according to their previous conditions. Since `old` is added to `todo`, the condition for updating `extra` and `todo` based on the length of `done` remains the same.
