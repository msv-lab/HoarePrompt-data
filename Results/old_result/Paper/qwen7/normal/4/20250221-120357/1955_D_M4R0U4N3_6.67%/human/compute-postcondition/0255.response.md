Output State: **`r` is either `r_end + 1` or `r_end + 2`, `old` is either `a[r - m]` or `a[r - m - 1]`, `extra` does not contain `old`, `done` includes `old` if `old` was in `todo` and does not include `old` if `old` was in `done`, `todo` includes `old` if `old` was in `done` and does not include `old` if `old` was in `todo`, `ans` is increased by 1, `extra` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `extra` or `todo`, and `todo` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `done` or `todo`.**

In this output state, the variable `ans` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous conditions regarding their inclusion or exclusion from other variables, and `extra` and `todo` are updated based on the presence of `old` in them.
