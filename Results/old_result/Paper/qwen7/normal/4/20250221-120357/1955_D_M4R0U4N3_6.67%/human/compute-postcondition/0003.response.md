Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set containing integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `todo = set(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`, and then creates a set from these integers. The values of `t`, `a`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The new variable `todo` is a set of integers derived from the input.
