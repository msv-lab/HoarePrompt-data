Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `old` is now `a[r - m] - old` has been removed from `done`, `a[r]` is in `todo`, no changes occur to `done` and `todo`, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code removes the value of `old` from the list `done`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `old` is updated to reflect its removal from `done`.
