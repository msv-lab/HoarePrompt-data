Postcondition: `ans` is either 2 or 3; `r` is `m + 2`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` now includes `a[r]` and `done` now includes `a[r]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `done` now includes `a[r]` and `todo` remains unchanged. If `a[r]` is in `extra`, then `extra` is modified by removing `a[r]`. If `a[r]` is not in `done`, then no changes are made to `done` and `todo`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo` or `extra`, then `extra` includes `a[r]` and `done` and `todo` remain unchanged.
