Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 1
   - `m` is at least 1
   - If `a[j]` is in the `todo` list, then `todo` list has the element at index `j` removed, and `done` set has the element `a[j]` added.
   - If `a[j]` is not in the `todo` list, then `extra` contains `a[1]`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for j in range(m):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `m-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 2.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged as it is determined before the loop starts.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - `j` will be 2 in the next iteration.
   - `m` remains at least 1 (unchanged).

5. **Conditions in the Loop Body:**
   - The loop body checks if `a[j]` is in the `todo` list.
     - If `a[2]` is in the `todo` list, it will be removed, and `a[2]` will be added to the `done` set.
     - If `a[2]` is not in the `todo` list, `extra` will contain `a[2]`.

6. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `j` will be 2.
   - `m` will still be at least 1.
   - The `todo` list and `done` set will be adjusted based on the presence of `a[2]` in the `todo` list.
   - `extra` will contain `a[2]` if `a[2]` is not in the `todo` list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`j` is 2, `m` is at least 1**
