Output State: The loop has executed from `r = m` to `r = n-1`. After all iterations, `r` will be `n-1`. The variable `old` will hold the value of `a[m-1]` since it is initialized before each iteration with `a[r - m]` and `r` starts from `m` and goes up to `n-1`. The value of `ans` will be the total number of times the condition `len(done) >= k` was met during the loop's execution. The sets `done` and `todo` will contain integers that were found in `a` and removed from `extra` respectively, while `extra` will contain integers that were not found in `todo` but were present in `a`.
