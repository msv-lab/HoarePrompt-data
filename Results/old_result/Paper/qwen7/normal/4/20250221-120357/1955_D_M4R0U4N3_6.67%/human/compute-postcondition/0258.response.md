Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `r`, `m`, and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `r` is within the range `[m, n)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `r` is either `r_end + 1` or `r_end + 2`.
   - `old` is either `a[r - m]` or `a[r - m - 1]`.
   - `extra` does not contain `old`.
   - `done` includes `old` if `old` was in `todo` and does not include `old` if `old` was in `done`.
   - `todo` includes `old` if `old` was in `done` and does not include `old` if `old` was in `todo`.
   - `ans` is increased by 1.
   - `extra` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `extra` or `todo`.
   - `todo` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `done` or `todo` if `len(done) >= k`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `r` from `m` to `n`, the next value of `r` will be `r_end + 1` or `r_end + 2` (whichever it is) incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `r` will be `r_end + 2` or `r_end + 3`.

5. **Adjust the other states**:
   - `old` will be updated to `a[r - m]` or `a[r - m - 1]` depending on the new value of `r`.
   - `extra`, `done`, `todo`, `ans`, and their relationships will be updated based on the new value of `r`.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**State:**
- `r` is either `r_end + 3` or `r_end + 4`.
- `old` is either `a[(r_end + 2) - m]` or `a[(r_end + 2) - m - 1]` (or equivalently, `a[(r_end + 3) - m]` or `a[(r_end + 3) - m - 1]`).
- `extra` does not contain `old`.
- `done` includes `old` if `old` was in `todo` and does not include `old` if `old` was in `done`.
- `todo` includes `old` if `old` was in `done` and does not include `old` if `old` was in `todo`.
- `ans` is increased by 1.
- `extra` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `extra` or `todo`.
- `todo` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `done` or `todo` if `len(done) >= k`.

So, the final state is:
**State: **`r` is either `r_end + 3` or `r_end + 4`, `old` is either `a[(r_end + 2) - m]` or `a[(r_end + 2) - m - 1]` (or equivalently, `a[(r_end + 3) - m]` or `a[(r_end + 3) - m - 1]`), `extra` does not contain `old`, `done` includes `old` if `old` was in `todo` and does not include `old` if `old` was in `done`, `todo` includes `old` if `old` was in `done` and does not include `old` if `old` was in `todo`, `ans` is increased by 1, `extra` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `extra` or `todo`, `todo` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `done` or `todo` if `len(done) >= k`.**
