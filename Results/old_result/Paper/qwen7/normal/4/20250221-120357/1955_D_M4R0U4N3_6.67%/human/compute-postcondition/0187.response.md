Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values, `ans` retains its original value, `r` is equal to `n - 2`, the sets `done`, `todo`, and `extra` reflect the final state after processing all elements from index `m` to `n-2` in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and splits them into a list using `map(int, input().split())`. This means the list `a` is updated with the new values, but the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `ans`, `r`, `done`, `todo`, and `extra` remain unchanged from their initial state.
