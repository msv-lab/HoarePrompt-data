Output State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `a[r]` is added to `done`, `todo` does not contain `a[r]`, no changes occur to `done` and `todo` unless the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, in which case `ans` is increased by 1; if `old` was in `extra`, `extra.remove(old)` is executed and `old` is no longer assigned the value of `a[r - m]`; if `old` was in `done`, `ans` is increased by 1 and `todo` now contains `old`.**

This means that the variable `a[r]` has been added to the set `done`. All other conditions and relationships between variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
