Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are not affected by this operation, so they retain their original status as integers obtained from the input split. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was defined before the code snippet.
