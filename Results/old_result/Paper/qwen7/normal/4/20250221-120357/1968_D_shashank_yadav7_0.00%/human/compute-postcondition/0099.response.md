Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `bm` plus the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp + a[b]`, `sm` is `sm` plus the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp**.

Explanation:
- `bp` is incremented by `a[b]`. The previous value of `bp` was `bp + a[b]`.
- All other variables (`i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
