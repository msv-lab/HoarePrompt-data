Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is the input integer decreased by 1, `s` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

In this case, the variable `b` is decremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
