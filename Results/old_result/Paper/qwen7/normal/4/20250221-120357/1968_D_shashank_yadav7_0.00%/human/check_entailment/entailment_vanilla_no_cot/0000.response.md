Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. Here's a brief explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` (Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions), and then the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
3. **Position Adjustment**: It adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` to be zero-indexed.
4. **Initial Scores Calculation**: It calculates the initial scores for Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions.
5. **Game Simulation**: It simulates the game for `k` turns, updating the positions and scores of both players according to the rules. It uses a loop to simulate each turn, updating the positions and adding the appropriate scores.
6. **Result Determination**: After simulating the game, it compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha to determine the winner or if it's a draw.

The logic in the program accurately reflects the problem statement and handles all the necessary steps to determine the winner of the game. Therefore, the program is correct.
