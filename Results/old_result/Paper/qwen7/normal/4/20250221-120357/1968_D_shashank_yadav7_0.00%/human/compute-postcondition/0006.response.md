Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is the input integer decreased by 1, `s` is the input integer decreased by 1, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The value of `s` is decremented by 1, so `s` is now the input integer decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
