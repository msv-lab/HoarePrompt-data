Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game for all possible cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where the players can choose to stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation array. Instead, it only considers moving to the new position and does not account for the possibility of staying at the current position.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

```
Input:
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

According to the problem description, on each turn, a player can either stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation array. However, the provided program only considers moving to the new position, which leads to incorrect results.

For example, in the above test case:
- Initially, Bodya is at position 3 and Sasha is at position 2.
- In the first turn, Bodya can choose to stay at position 3 or move to position 2 (since `p[3] = 2`).
- Similarly, Sasha can choose to stay at position 2 or move to position 1 (since `p[2] = 1`).

The program does not account for these choices, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
