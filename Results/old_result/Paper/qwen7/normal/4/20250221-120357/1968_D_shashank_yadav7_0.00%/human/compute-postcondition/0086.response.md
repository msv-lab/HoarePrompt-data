Output State: **`k` is decreased by 2, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is `p[s]` - 2, `sm` is increased by the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`, `i` is 1, `b` is `p[b]` - 1, `bm` is increased by the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`**.

Explanation: The code updates `sm` to be the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`. Given the initial state, `k` is already decreased by 1, so it is now decreased by 2. All other variables remain unchanged except for `sm`, which is updated according to the given formula.
