Output State: **`k` is decreased by 4, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is `p[s]` - 2, `sm` is increased by the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s] * 2`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`, `i` is 1, `b` is `p[b]` - 1, `bm` is increased by the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`**.

Explanation:
- The variable `sp` is increased by `a[s]`. Since `sp` was previously `a[s]`, now `sp` is `a[s] * 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state as no other operations affect them.
