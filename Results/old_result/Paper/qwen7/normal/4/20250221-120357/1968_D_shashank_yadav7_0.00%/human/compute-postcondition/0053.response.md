Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`
- `k` equals 0
- `b` and `s` are updated as described (though their specific values are not needed for this particular print statement)
- `bm` and `sm` reflect the maximum values calculated during the last iteration
- Both `sp` and `bp` have been incremented accordingly
- `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('Draw')
```

This statement will print the string 'Draw' directly.

Output: **Draw**
