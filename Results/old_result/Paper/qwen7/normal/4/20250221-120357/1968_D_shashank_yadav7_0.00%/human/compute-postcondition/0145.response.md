Output State: **`k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 2 - 1`, `bm` is `2 * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `a[s] * k + max(a[s] * k + sp, sm) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + (a[s] + sp)`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + a[b]`, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, and `bm` is greater than `sm` or `bm` equals `sm` depending on the values of `bm` and `sm`.**

Explanation: The code `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` updates the value of `sm` by adding `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` to it. The value of `a[s] * k + sp` is calculated using the current values of `a[s]`, `k`, and `sp`. Since `k` is -1, `a[s] * k + sp` simplifies to `-a[s] + sp`. The updated value of `sm` is then `a[s] * k + max(a[s] * k + sp, sm) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, which further simplifies to `-a[s] + max(-a[s] + sp, sm) + max(sm, -a[s] + sp)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
