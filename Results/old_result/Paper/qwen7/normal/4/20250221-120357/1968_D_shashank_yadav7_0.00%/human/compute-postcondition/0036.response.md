Output State: **`i` is 0, `p[b]` is decreased by 1, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is increased by the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `bm` is increased by the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`, `k` is decreased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This output state reflects that the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program has exited the current loop or conditional block. All the previous conditions and operations remain intact.
