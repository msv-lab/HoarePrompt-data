Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to n with every second element reversed.**

Explanation: The code `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses every second element in the list `a`. Initially, `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n`. After executing the code, every second element in `a` (starting from index 0) will be reversed. For example, if `n` is 5, the list `a` would initially be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and after executing the code, it would become `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.
