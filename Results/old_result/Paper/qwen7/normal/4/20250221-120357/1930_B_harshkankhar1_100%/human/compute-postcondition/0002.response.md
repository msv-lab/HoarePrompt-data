Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` with every second element reversed.

The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces. Since the list `a` contains integers from 1 to `n` with every second element reversed, the list will look like this:

\[ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \ldots, n-1, n] \]

However, every second element is reversed. This means the list will actually look like:

\[ [1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-3, \ldots] \]

For example, if `n = 5`, the list `a` would be:

\[ [1, 5, 3, 4, 5] \]

When `print(*a)` is executed, it will print the elements of the list separated by spaces. Therefore, the output will be the elements of the list `a` printed in the described order.

Output: **1 [n] 3 [n-1] 5 [n-3] ... (where [n] is the last element, [n-1] is the second last element, and so on, following the pattern of reversing every second element)**
