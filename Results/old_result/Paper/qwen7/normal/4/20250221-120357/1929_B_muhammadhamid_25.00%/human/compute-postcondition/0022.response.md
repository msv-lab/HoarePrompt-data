Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is the first integer input split from the input string.
- `k` is the second integer input split from the input string and its current value is 1.
- We then take the next input, which is an integer, and update `n` to this new value.
- `k` is updated to the second integer input.

Given these conditions, the value of `k` will be the second integer input after the initial value of 1. After updating `k` with the second integer input, the expression `k // 2 + 1` will be evaluated.

Since the exact value of the second integer input is not specified, let's denote it as `second_input`.

Therefore, the expression `k // 2 + 1` will evaluate to `(second_input // 2) + 1`.

Output: **(second_input // 2) + 1**
