Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string and its current value is 1, and the next input is an integer, `n` is an integer input, `k` is updated to the second integer input, and we continue the loop.
