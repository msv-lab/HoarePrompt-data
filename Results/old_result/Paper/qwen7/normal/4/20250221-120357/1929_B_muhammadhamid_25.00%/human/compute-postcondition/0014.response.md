Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string and its current value is 1, and if `k` is less than or equal to twice the value of `n`, then `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, \(k > 2 \times n\).
