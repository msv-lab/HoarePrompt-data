The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers n and k, where n is between 2 and \(10^8\) and k is between 1 and \(4n - 2\). For each test case, it prints a calculated value based on the conditions: if k is 1, it prints 1; if k is less than or equal to 2n, it prints the ceiling of k/2; otherwise, it prints k/2 rounded down plus 1. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no return value.
