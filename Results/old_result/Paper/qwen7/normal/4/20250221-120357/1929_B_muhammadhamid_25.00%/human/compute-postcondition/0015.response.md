Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved here are the input itself, which is read within the loop.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for as many times as the integer input given by the user. Each iteration of the loop does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `k` directly; instead, it reads a new input.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**: Since the loop reads a new input each time, the state of the input variable (which is an integer) will change. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged unless they are modified within the loop body, which is not specified here.

Given that the loop reads a new input each time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input itself, which will be the next integer input from the user.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `n` is the first integer input split from the input string
- `k` is the second integer input split from the input string and its current value is 1
- The next input (which will be read in the next iteration) is an integer

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration can be described as follows:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string and its current value is 1, and the next input is an integer**.
