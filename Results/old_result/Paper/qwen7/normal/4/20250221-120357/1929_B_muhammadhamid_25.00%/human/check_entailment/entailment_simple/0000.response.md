Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic of the function `func()` and compare it with the problem statement and examples provided.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It handles different cases based on the value of \( k \):
     - If \( k = 1 \), it prints 1 because at least one diagonal must have a colored cell.
     - If \( k \leq 2n \), it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \). This is because each diagonal can be split into two halves, and we need to color enough cells to cover at least \( k \) diagonals.
     - Otherwise, it prints \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).

3. **Verification**:
   - For \( k = 1 \): The solution is correct since we need to color at least one cell.
   - For \( k \leq 2n \): 
     - Consider \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \). The function will print \( \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 \). This is correct because we can color 2 cells to cover 4 diagonals.
   - For \( k > 2n \):
     - Consider \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 7 \). The function will print \( \frac{7}{2} + 1 = 4 \). This is correct because we need to cover 7 diagonals, and we can do this by coloring 4 cells.

Given the analysis, the function correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of cells to color for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
