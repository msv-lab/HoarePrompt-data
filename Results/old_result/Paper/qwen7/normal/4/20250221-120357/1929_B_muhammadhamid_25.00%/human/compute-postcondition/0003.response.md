Output: **1**

Explanation: The initial state tells us that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, and `k` is the second integer input split from the input string with an initial value of 1. The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer 1, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`. Therefore, the output is **1**.
