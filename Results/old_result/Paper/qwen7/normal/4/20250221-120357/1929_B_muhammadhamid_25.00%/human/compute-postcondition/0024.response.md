Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string and its current value is 1, and the next input is an integer, `n` is an integer input, `k` is updated to the second integer input, and we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts because the postconditions provided for both parts are identical. Therefore, regardless of whether the condition `k <= 2 * n` is true or false, the state of the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` as well as the continuation of the loop remain unchanged.
