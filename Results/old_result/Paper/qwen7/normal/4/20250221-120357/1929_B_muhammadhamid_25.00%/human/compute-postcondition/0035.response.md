Output State: **All test cases defined by the initial state have been processed.**

This means that the loop has executed for each of the `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). For each test case, the loop reads two integers, `n` and `k`, processes them according to the given conditions, and prints the result. After processing all `t` test cases, the loop terminates, and no further iterations occur. The variables `n` and `k` are reset for each new test case, and the loop continues until all `t` test cases have been handled.
