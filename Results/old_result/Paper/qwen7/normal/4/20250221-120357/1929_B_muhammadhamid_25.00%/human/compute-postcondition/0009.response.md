Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is the first integer input split from the input string.
- `k` is the second integer input split from the input string and its current value is 1.
- `k` is less than or equal to twice the value of `n`.

Given these conditions, the expression `math.ceil(k / 2)` will evaluate as follows:

- Since `k` is currently 1, the expression inside the `math.ceil` function becomes `math.ceil(1 / 2)`.
- `1 / 2` evaluates to `0.5`.
- `math.ceil(0.5)` rounds `0.5` up to the nearest integer, which is `1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output `1`.

Output: **1**
