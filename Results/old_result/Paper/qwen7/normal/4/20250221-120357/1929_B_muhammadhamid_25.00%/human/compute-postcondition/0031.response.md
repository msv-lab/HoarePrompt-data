Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is the first integer input from the next iteration.
- `k` is the second integer input from the previous iteration.
- If `k` equals 1, we continue the loop. If `k` does not equal 1, no change is made to the variables.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(math.ceil(k / 2))
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to consider the value of `k`:
- If `k` equals 1, the loop continues, and this line of code is not executed.
- If `k` does not equal 1, the code will execute and print the result of `math.ceil(k / 2)`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **math.ceil(k / 2) (where k is the second integer input from the previous iteration)**
