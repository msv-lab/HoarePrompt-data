Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the integer value of \(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k\), `p2` is \((n - k) \times a\). If `a >= b`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the input values. Otherwise, `k` is updated to the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is recalculated as \(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k\), and `p2` is updated to \((n - k) \times a\).**
