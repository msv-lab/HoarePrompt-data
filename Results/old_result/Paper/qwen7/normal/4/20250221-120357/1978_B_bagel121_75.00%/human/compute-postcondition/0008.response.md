Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `a` is less than `b`; `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k), `p2` is `(n - k) * a`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `(n - k) * a` to the variable `p2`. All other variables retain their initial conditions. The value of `k` and the calculation of `ans` remain unchanged.
