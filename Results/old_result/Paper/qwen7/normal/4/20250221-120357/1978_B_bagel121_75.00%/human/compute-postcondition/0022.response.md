Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the integer value of \(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k\), `p2` is \((n - k) \times a\), `n` is updated to the input integer, `a` is updated to the input integer, `b` is updated to the input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `ans`, `p2`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are now the input integers provided by the user.
