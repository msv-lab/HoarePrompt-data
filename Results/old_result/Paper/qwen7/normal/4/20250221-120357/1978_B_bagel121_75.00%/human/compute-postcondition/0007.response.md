Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `a` is less than `b`; `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)**.

This means that the value of `ans` is computed using the formula `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, where `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`. All other variables retain their initial conditions from the preconditions.
