Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`.
2. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `m`, as well as `b[j]` and `a[i]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop head must be true:
- `j < m`
- `b[j] != a[i]`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` is equal to the original value of `j` plus 1.
- `m` is greater than `j`.
- `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to maintain these conditions:
- Since `j` is already incremented by 1 from its original value, for the loop to continue, `j` must still be less than `m`.
- `m` must remain greater than `j`.
- `b[j]` must still not be equal to `a[i]`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that:
- `j` is less than `m`.
- `m` is greater than `j`.
- `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`.

Since `j` is already incremented by 1, and `m` is greater than `j`, and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`, no further adjustments are necessary.

**Final State:**
State: **`j` is equal to the original value of `j` plus 1, `m` is greater than `j`, and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`**
