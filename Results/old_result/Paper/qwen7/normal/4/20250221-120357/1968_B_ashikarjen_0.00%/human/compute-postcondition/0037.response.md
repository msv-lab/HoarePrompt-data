Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`.
2. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `m`, as well as `b[j]` and `a[i]`.

3. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `j` is equal to the initial value of `j` plus the total number of iterations plus 1.
   - `j` is still less than `m`.
   - `i` is equal to the initial value of `i` plus the total number of iterations plus 1.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must be less than `m` and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.
   - Given that `j` is already less than `m` (as stated in the current state), we need to ensure that `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]` at the start of the loop.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - We need to ensure that `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]` at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be modified to reflect this requirement.

**State:**
State: **`j` is equal to the initial value of `j` plus the total number of iterations plus 1 and it is still less than `m`, and `i` is equal to the initial value of `i` plus the total number of iterations plus 1, and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`**
