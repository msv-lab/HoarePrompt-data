Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1()` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum prefix length `k` of string `a` that forms a subsequence of string `b`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by reading the lengths `n` and `m` of strings `a` and `b`, respectively, and then reads the strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Loop through `a`**: It uses a loop to iterate through each character of `a` (denoted by `i`). For each character `a[i]`, it searches for this character in `b` starting from the current position `j` in `b`.

3. **Search in `b`**: If the character `a[i]` is found in `b` at position `j`, it increments both `k` (to count the matched characters) and `j` (to move to the next character in `b`).

4. **Termination**: If the character `a[i]` is not found in `b` from the current position `j` to the end of `b`, the loop breaks, and the function prints the value of `k`.

5. **Output**: The function outputs the maximum `k` such that the first `k` characters of `a` form a subsequence of `b`.

Given the logic and the provided examples, the function correctly implements the required functionality without any logical errors or omissions.

Correctness: **True**
