Output State: **`j` is equal to `j` + 5 and is still less than `m`, and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`**

Explanation: The variable `j` was initially equal to `j` + 4 and was less than `m`. After executing `j += 1`, `j` is now equal to `j` + 5. The condition that `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]` remains unchanged.
