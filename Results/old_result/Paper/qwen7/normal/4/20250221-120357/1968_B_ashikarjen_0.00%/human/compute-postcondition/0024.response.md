Output State: **`j` is equal to `j` + 2 and is still less than `m`, and `b[j] != a[i]` must remain true**

Explanation: The variable `j` was initially equal to `j` + 1 and was less than `m`, and the condition `b[j] != a[i]` must remain true. After executing `j += 1`, `j` is now equal to `j` + 2. All other conditions and constraints remain the same.
