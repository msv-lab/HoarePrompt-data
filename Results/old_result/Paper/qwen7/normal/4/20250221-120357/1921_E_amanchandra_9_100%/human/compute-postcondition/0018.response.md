Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `r` is the minimum of `w` and either `d + x` or `b + x`, depending on whether `abs(a - c) % 2` is true or false. `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` retain their original values. If `abs(a - c) % 2` is true, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`. If `abs(a - c) % 2` is false, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.
