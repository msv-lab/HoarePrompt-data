Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the outcome of the game based on the given rules. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Position Comparison**: The program compares the initial vertical positions (`a` for Alice and `c` for Bob) to determine if Alice can force a win by moving down. If Alice's initial position is greater than Bob's, the game is a draw because Alice cannot reach Bob's position without Bob moving first.
3. **Range Calculation**: The program calculates the range within which Alice can move to potentially capture Bob. This is done using the formula `x = abs(a - c) // 2` and adjusting the left (`l`) and right (`r`) boundaries based on this value.
4. **Win Condition Check**: The program checks if Alice can capture Bob by ensuring that Bob's position falls within the calculated range. If so, Alice wins; otherwise, it's a draw.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program handles all scenarios correctly, making the correctness evaluation **True**.
