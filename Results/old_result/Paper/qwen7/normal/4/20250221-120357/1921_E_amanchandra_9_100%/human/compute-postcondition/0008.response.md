Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers inputted from the user, and `a` is less than or equal to `c`; `x` is the absolute value of `a - c` divided by 2.**

Explanation: The code calculates `x` as the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2. Since `a` is less than or equal to `c`, `a - c` will be a non-positive number. The `abs()` function ensures that `x` is a non-negative integer. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
