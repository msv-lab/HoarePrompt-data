Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), after executing the code, `t` retains this property but now holds the specific value entered by the user. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
