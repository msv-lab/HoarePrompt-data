Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `b + x`.
   - `w`, `b`, `a`, `c`, `d` are integers inputted from the user.
   - `a` is less than or equal to `c`.
   - `x` is the absolute value of `a - c` divided by 2.
   - The absolute value of `a - c` is even.
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.

2. **Calculating Values:**
   - Since `a` is less than or equal to `c` and the absolute value of `a - c` is even, let's assume specific values for `a` and `c` to illustrate. For example, if `a = 3` and `c = 5`, then `x = |3 - 5| / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1`.
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`. Assuming `b = 4` (since it's an integer and the exact value isn't specified), `l = max(1, 4 - 1) = max(1, 3) = 3`.

3. **Evaluating Conditions:**
   - We need to evaluate `abs(l - d) <= x` and `abs(r - d) <= x`.
   - Let's assume `d = 2` for illustration.
   - `abs(l - d) = abs(3 - 2) = 1`.
   - `abs(r - d) = abs(min(w, b + x) - d)`. Assuming `w = 6` and `b = 4`, then `r = min(6, 4 + 1) = min(6, 5) = 5`. So, `abs(5 - 2) = 3`.

4. **Condition Check:**
   - `abs(l - d) <= x` is `1 <= 1`, which is `True`.
   - `abs(r - d) <= x` is `3 <= 1`, which is `False`.

5. **Final Print Statement:**
   - The condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` evaluates to `False and False`, which is `False`.
   - Therefore, the expression `(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[False]` simplifies to `['Draw']`.
   - The `*` operator is used to unpack the list, so `print(*['Draw'])` will print `Draw`.

Output: **Draw**
