You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads six integers: `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`. These represent the height of the board, width of the board, Alice's position `(a, b)`, and Bob's position `(c, d)`.

2. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if `a > c`. If true, it prints 'Draw'. This condition seems incorrect because it doesn't consider the optimal moves of both players. Instead, it should check the relative positions and possible moves.

3. **Relative Position Calculation:**
   - If `a <= c`, the program calculates the absolute difference between Alice's and Bob's row positions (`x = abs(a - c)`).
   - If this difference is odd, it calculates the possible column range for Alice's next move (`l` and `r`).
   - If this difference is even, it calculates the possible column range for Bob's next move (`l` and `r`).

4. **Winning Condition Check:**
   - The program then checks if Alice or Bob can win based on the calculated ranges and the other player's current column position.
   - If Alice can win, it prints 'Alice'.
   - If Bob can win, it prints 'Bob'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Initial Condition:**
   - The condition `if a > c:` is incorrect. The program should check if Alice can force a win or if Bob can force a win based on their relative positions and possible moves.

2. **Column Range Calculation:**
   - The calculation of `l` and `r` for Alice and Bob is not correctly reflecting the possible moves. The logic for determining if Alice or Bob can win needs to be more precise.

3. **Winning Condition Logic:**
   - The logic to determine if Alice or Bob can win is flawed. It doesn't correctly simulate the optimal moves of both players.

### Correct Solution:
The correct approach involves simulating the optimal moves of both players and checking if either can force a win. Given the constraints, we need to consider the following:
- Alice can only move down, down-right, or down-left.
- Bob can only move up, up-right, or up-left.
- The game ends in a draw if either player cannot make a move.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the outcome of the game. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
