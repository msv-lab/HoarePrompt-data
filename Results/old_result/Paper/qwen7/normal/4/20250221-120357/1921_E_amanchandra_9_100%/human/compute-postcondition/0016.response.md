Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is the minimum of `w` and `b + x`, `w`, `b`, `a`, `c`, `d` are integers inputted from the user, and `a` is less than or equal to `c`; `x` is the absolute value of `a - c` divided by 2, and the absolute value of `a - c` is even; `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `r` to be the minimum of `w` and `b + x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `a` is less than or equal to `c` and `x` is the absolute value of `a - c` divided by 2 (with the absolute value being even) still holds. The value of `l` is also unchanged as it depends on `b - x`, which is not directly affected by the assignment to `r`.
