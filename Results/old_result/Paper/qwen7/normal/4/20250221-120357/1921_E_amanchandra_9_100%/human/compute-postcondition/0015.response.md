Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers inputted from the user, and `a` is less than or equal to `c`; `x` is the absolute value of `a - c` divided by 2, and the absolute value of `a - c` is even; `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `l` the value of the maximum between 1 and `b - x`. Since `x` is defined as the absolute value of `a - c` divided by 2 and it is given that the absolute value of `a - c` is even, `x` is a non-negative integer. The value of `l` will be `b - x` if `b - x` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise it will be 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
