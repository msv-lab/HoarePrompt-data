Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Logic Error**: The solution checks if the maximum count of any card type (`max(p)`) is greater than or equal to `k`. If true, it prints `k - 1` as the result. This logic is flawed because it doesn't account for the possibility of reducing the total number of cards through multiple operations.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Cases**: The solution does not handle cases where the maximum count of any card type is less than `k`, but the overall number of cards can still be reduced further through multiple operations.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following approach:

1. Count the occurrences of each card type.
2. For each card type, calculate how many full sets of `k` cards can be formed.
3. Calculate the remaining cards after forming these full sets.
4. Sum up the remaining cards for all types and return the result.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        card_counts = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
        min_cards_left = sum((count // (k - 1)) * (k - 1) for count in card_counts)
        
        print(min_cards_left)

func()
```

This solution correctly calculates the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the allowed operations.
