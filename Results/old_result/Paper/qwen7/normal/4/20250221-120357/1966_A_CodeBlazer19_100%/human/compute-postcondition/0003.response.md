Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an integer type using `map(int, ...)` and then creates a list `l` from these converted integers. The original values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
