Postcondition: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers created by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l`. If the maximum count in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program does not change `n`, `k`, `l`, and `p`. Otherwise, the program does not change `n`, `k`, `l`, and `p`.**
