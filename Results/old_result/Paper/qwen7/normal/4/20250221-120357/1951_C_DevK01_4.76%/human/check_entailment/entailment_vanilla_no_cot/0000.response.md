To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets under the given constraints.

### Analysis

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices `M`.

2. **Sorting Prices:**
   - The prices are sorted, which helps in considering the lowest prices first.
   
3. **Calculating the Number of Days Needed:**
   - The variable `q` is calculated as the ceiling of `k / m`, which determines how many days are needed to buy `k` tickets if buying `m` tickets per day.

4. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the cost in two main scenarios:
     - When the number of tickets bought per day (`m`) times the number of days (`q`) equals `k`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the cost by splitting the purchase into full days and partial days.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the number of tickets bought per day times the number of days is exactly `k`.
   - It also handles the case where the number of tickets bought per day times the number of days is less than `k` but still considers the remaining tickets.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify the correctness of the program with the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
- Input: `4 2 3`
- Ticket prices: `[8, 6, 4, 2]`
- Output: `10`

- The optimal strategy is:
  - Day 1: Buy 0 tickets (price remains [6, 4, 2])
  - Day 2: Buy 0 tickets (price remains [4, 2])
  - Day 3: Buy 1 ticket (cost = 4, new price = [3])
  - Day 4: Buy 2 tickets (cost = 6 * 2 = 12, new price = [3])

- Total cost: `4 + 6 = 10`

#### Example 2:
- Input: `4 2 8`
- Ticket prices: `[8, 6, 4, 2]`
- Output: `64`

- The optimal strategy is:
  - Day 1: Buy 2 tickets (cost = 16, new price = [8, 6, 4, 2])
  - Day 2: Buy 2 tickets (cost = 16, new price = [8, 6, 4, 2])
  - Day 3: Buy 2 tickets (cost = 16, new price = [8, 6, 4, 2])
  - Day 4: Buy 2 tickets (cost = 16, new price = [8, 6, 4, 2])

- Total cost: `16 * 4 = 64`

#### Example 3:
- Input: `5 100 1`
- Ticket prices: `[10000, 1, 100, 10, 1000]`
- Output: `1`

- The optimal strategy is:
  - Day 1: Buy 1 ticket (cost = 10000)

- Total cost: `10000`

#### Example 4:
- Input: `6 3 9`
- Ticket prices: `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
- Output: `72`

- The optimal strategy is:
  - Day 1: Buy 3 tickets (cost = 3 * 5 = 15, new price = [5, 5, 5, 5])
  - Day 2: Buy 3 tickets (cost = 3 * 5 = 15, new price = [5, 5, 5])
  - Day 3: Buy 3 tickets (cost = 3 * 5 = 15, new price = [5, 5])

- Total cost: `15 * 3 + 15 * 2 + 15 = 72`

### Conclusion

After verifying the examples, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets under the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
