To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the formula for `cost`.

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `n` is the length of `N`.
   - `m` is the minimum of the second and third elements of `L`.
   - `k` is the third element of `L`.
   - `L` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `M` is the same list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`.
   - `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`.
   - `cost` is either:
     - `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`.
     - `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` where `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` if `n * m != k`.

2. **Key observations:**
   - Since `L` is sorted in ascending order, the second and third elements of `L` are `L[1]` and `L[2]`, respectively.
   - Therefore, `m` is the smaller of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
   - `k` is `L[2]`.
   - `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, which means `q = ceil(L[2] / min(L[1], L[2]))`.
   - `N` contains the first `q` elements of `M`, which are the first `q` elements of `L`.

3. **Determining `cost`:**
   - We need to check if `n * m == k` to decide which formula to use.
   - If `n * m == k`, then `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise, `cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` where `mu = k - (n - 1) * m`.

Given these details, the exact value of `cost` depends on the specific values of `L` and `N`. However, without the actual values of `L` and `N`, we can only describe the general form of the output.

Output: **cost (where cost is either m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) if n * m == k, or mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu where mu is k - (n - 1) * m if n * m != k)**
