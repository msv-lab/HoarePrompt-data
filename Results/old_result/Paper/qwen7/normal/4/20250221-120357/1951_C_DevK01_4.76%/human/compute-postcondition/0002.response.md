Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list `L`. The initial condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still greater than 0, and `L` is now a list of integers.
