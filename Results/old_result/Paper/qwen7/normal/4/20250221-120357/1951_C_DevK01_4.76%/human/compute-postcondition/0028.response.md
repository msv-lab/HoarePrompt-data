Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is the first element of `L`, `m` is the minimum of the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `L` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `M` is the same list of integers sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `M.sort()` sorts the list `M` in ascending order. Since `L` and `M` are the same list of integers, sorting `M` also sorts `L`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
