Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is the first element of `L`, `m` is the second element of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `L` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `M` is the same list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first, second, and third elements of the list `L` to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The values of `t` and the lists `L` and `M` remain unchanged.
