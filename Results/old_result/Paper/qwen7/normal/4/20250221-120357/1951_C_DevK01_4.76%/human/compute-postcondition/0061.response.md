Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` must be equal to the total number of iterations executed, `n` is the length of the final list `N` after processing all inputs, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of the last list `L`, `k` is the third element of the last list `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of the last sorted list `M`, and `cost` is calculated based on the conditions provided in the loop body. If `n * m == k`, then `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, where `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` and `w` is the last element of list `N` before it is popped. The loop will have printed the `cost` for each iteration, and now all iterations are complete.
