You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n⋅m, 10^9). a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
        
        m = min(m, k)
        
        M.sort()
        
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        
        N = M[:q]
        
        n = len(N)
        
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            w = N.pop()
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = mu * w
            n = len(N)
            cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu
        
        print(cost)
        
        continue
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` will be equal to the total number of iterations the loop ran, which is the final value of `t` provided as input. For each iteration, `n` will be the length of the list `N`, which contains the first `q` elements of `M` after sorting. `m` will be the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`. `k` will be the third element of `L`. `q` will be the ceiling value of `k / m`. `N` will be a list containing the first `q` elements of `M` after sorting. `cost` will be calculated based on the conditions given: if `n * m == k`, then `cost` will be `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `cost` will be `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, where `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` and `w` is the last element of `N` before it is popped. The program will print the `cost` for each iteration and continue to the next one until all iterations are completed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a test case defined by the variables t, n, m, k, and a. It returns a result based on the given conditions for each test case.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
