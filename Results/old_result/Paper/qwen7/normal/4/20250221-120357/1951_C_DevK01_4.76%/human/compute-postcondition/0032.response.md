Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `L` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `M` is the same list of integers sorted in ascending order, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**.

Explanation:
- The code calculates the `cost` using the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Here, `sum(N)` is the sum of the first `q` elements of `M`, and `n` is the length of `N`.
- `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, which means `q` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / m`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `L`, `M`, and `q` remain unchanged.
- `N` remains the list containing the first `q` elements of `M`.
- `cost` is calculated and stored as a new variable.
