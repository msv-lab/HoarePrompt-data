Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and we are waiting for further inputs for `n`, `m`, `k`, and list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
    m = min(m, k)
    M.sort()
    q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
    N = M[:q]
    n = len(N)
    if n * m == k:
        cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
    else:
        w = N.pop()
        mu = k - (n - 1) * m
        cost = mu * w
        n = len(N)
        cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu
    print(cost)
    continue


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input string, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `cost` is the original cost plus `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * (k - (n - 1) * m)`. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `L` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `M` is the same list of integers sorted in ascending order, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, and `cost` is either `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, or `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` where `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` if `n * m != k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `L`, `m` is the minimum of the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `L`, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in list `N`, the cost is either `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, or `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` where `w` is the last element of list `N` before popping, and `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` if `n * m != k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
