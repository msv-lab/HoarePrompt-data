Output State: **`n` is the length of `N`, `t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input string, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is a value such that `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `cost` is the original cost plus `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * (k - (n - 1) * m)**

Explanation:
- The variable `cost` is updated by adding `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` to its current value.
- `sum(N)` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `N`.
- `((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2)` calculates the number of unique pairs that can be formed from `n-1` elements.
- `mu` is defined as `k - (n - 1) * m`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
