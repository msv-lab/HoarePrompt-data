Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `L` is a list of integers entered by the user; `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input string; `n` is the first element of `L`; `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`; `k` is the third element of `L`.**

Explanation: The code `M.sort()` sorts the list `M` in ascending order. The other variables (`t`, `L`, `n`, `m`, `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `M` is now a sorted version of the original list of integers entered by the user.
