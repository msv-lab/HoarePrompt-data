Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is greater than 5, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `ans` is `ans + 2`, `l` is increased by 1, and `a[l]` is now 0; `r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the updated state includes `r` being decreased by 1.
