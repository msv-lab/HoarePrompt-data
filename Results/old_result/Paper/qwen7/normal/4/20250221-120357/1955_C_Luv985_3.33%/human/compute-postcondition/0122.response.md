Output State: **`ans` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
