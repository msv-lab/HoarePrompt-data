Postcondition: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from input and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is reduced by `2 * mi`, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` using map and lambda, `l` is 3, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 3, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[2]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[n - 3]`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `ans` is updated to 4.
