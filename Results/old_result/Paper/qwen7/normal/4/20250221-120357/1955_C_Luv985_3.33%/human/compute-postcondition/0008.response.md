Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` using map and lambda.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))` converts each string element in the list `a` to an integer. The values of `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The list `a` is updated to contain integers instead of strings.
