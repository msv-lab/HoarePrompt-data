Output State: **`a` is a list of integers converted from original strings, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 2, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `t` is `k % 2`, the current value of `a[l]` is 0, the current value of `a[r]` is 0, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was `n - 1`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
