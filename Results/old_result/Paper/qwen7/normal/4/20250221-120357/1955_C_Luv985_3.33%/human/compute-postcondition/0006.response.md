Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input.**

Explanation: The code `k = int(k)` converts the string `k` into an integer. The values of `T` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `T` is still `T - 1`, `n` is still an integer from input, and `k` is now an integer from input.
