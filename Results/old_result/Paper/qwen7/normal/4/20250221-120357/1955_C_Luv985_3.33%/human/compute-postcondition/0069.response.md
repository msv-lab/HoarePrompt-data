Postcondition: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is greater than 5, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `ans` is `ans + 1`, `l` is increased by 1, `a[l]` is now 0, and `r` is decreased by 1 if `a[r]` is not zero. If `a[r]` is zero, `ans` is `ans + 2`, `l` is increased by 1, and `a[l]` is now 0.
