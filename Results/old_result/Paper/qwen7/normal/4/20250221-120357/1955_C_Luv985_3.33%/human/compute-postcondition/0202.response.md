Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers converted from original strings, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `t` is `k % 2`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is set to 2, and if the current value of `a[r]` is 0, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi` and `ans` is set to 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1. If `mi * 2 > k`, `ans` remains 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
