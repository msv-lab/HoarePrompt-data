Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` must be greater than 5, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code `k -= mi * 2` subtracts `2 * mi` from `k`. The value of `mi` remains the same as it was before, and it is still the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. The other variables (`T`, `n`, `a[r]`) are not affected by this operation.
