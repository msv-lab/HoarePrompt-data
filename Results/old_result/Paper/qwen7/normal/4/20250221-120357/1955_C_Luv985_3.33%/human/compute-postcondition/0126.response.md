Output State: **`l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `ans` is `ans + 1`**.

In natural language, the output state is: `l` remains 1, `r` remains `n - 1`, `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` (which is `a[n - 1]`) is decreased by `mi`, and `ans` is incremented by 1.
