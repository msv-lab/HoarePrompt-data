Postcondition: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is greater than 5, `k` is adjusted based on the condition (`k - 2 * mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `k % 2`), `a[r]` is modified (reduced by `mi` if not zero, or `a[r]` becomes zero and `ans` increases by 2 if zero), `a[l]` is set to 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[r]` is not zero, `l` is increased by 1, and `r` is decreased by 1 if `a[r]` is not zero. The loop or if-else block is exited if `a[r]` is zero and `t` is set to `k % 2`.
