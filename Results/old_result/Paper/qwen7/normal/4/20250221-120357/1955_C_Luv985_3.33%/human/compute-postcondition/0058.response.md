Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` must be greater than 5, `k` must be greater than `2 * mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `mi` the value of the minimum between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. The values of `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
