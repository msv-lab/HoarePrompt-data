Postcondition: `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `k` must be greater than `mi * 2`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, and `ans` is 2; `t` is `k % 2`. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is set to 2. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.
