Output State: **`a[2]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `l` is 3, `r` is `n - 1` and must be greater than 1, `ans` is either 2 or 3, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[2]` and `a[n-1]`, `t` is `k % 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
