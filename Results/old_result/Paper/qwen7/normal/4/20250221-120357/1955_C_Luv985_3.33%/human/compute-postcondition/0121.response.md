Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, where `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. The values of `l`, `r`, `a[0]`, and `a[r]` remain unchanged from their initial state.
