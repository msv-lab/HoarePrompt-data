Postcondition: **Output State: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from input and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer from input and `k` is reduced based on the conditions inside the loop, `k` must be non-negative, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` using map and lambda, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is the total count of elements in `a` that become zero during the loop iterations, `a[l]` is either 0 or positive depending on the final value of `k` and the operations performed, and `t` is `k % 2` if the loop breaks due to `mi * 2 > k`. The current value of `l` is equal to `r`, which means the loop has terminated with `l` and `r` meeting or `k` becoming 0.**
