Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from input and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer from input and `k` is reduced by either `2 * mi` or `0`, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` using map and lambda, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 2, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[2]` is decreased by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[n - 3]`**

Explanation: The code `a[l] -= mi` decrements the element at index `l` (which is 2) in the list `a` by the value of `mi`. Since `l` is 2, `a[2]` is decreased by `mi`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
