Output State: **`a[2]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `l` is 3, `r` is `n - 2` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is either 4 or 3 (depending on the initial value), `mi` is the minimum value between `a[2]` and `a[n-1]`, `t` is `k % 2`**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Given that `r` was initially `n - 1`, after the decrement, `r` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
