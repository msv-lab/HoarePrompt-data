Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` using map and lambda, `l` is 0.**

The code simply initializes `l` to 0, which does not affect the values of `T`, `n`, `k`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
