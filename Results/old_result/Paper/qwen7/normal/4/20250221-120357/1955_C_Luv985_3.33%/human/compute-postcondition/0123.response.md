Output State: **`ans` is 1, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The line `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Initially, `l` was set to 0, so after executing this line, `l` becomes 1. The values of `ans`, `r`, `k`, `mi`, `a[0]`, and `a[r]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
