Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 0 and equal to `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings in the original list, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. The current value of `a[l]` is 0.**

This postcondition summarizes that if `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is updated to 1, and `ans` is set to 1. All other variables retain their values as specified in the precondition.
