Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` must be greater than 5, `k` must be greater than `2 * mi`, `t` is `k % 2`, `ans` is `ans + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other variables (`T`, `n`, `k`, `mi`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
