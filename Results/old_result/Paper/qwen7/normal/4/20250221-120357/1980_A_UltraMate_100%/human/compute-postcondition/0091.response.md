Output State: **All characters in the string 'ABCDEFG' are checked against `hmp`. If any character in 'ABCDEFG' is not found in `hmp`, `ans` is incremented by `m` for each such character.**

In more detail:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string 'ABCDEFG'.
- For each character `i` in `p`, it checks if `i` is not in `hmp`.
- If `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is incremented by the value of `m`.
- After all iterations, `ans` will be the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that is not present in `hmp`.

The final value of `ans` depends on which characters from 'ABCDEFG' are not in `hmp`. If none of the characters are missing from `hmp`, `ans` will remain 0. If all characters are missing, `ans` will be `7 * m` (since there are 7 characters in 'ABCDEFG').
