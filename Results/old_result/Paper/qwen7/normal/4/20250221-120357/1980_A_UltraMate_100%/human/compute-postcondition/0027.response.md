Output State: **`hmp` contains at least one element, `i` is the next key in `hmp`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, and `ans` is updated by `m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`**.

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated based on the condition that if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`. The values of `hmp` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
