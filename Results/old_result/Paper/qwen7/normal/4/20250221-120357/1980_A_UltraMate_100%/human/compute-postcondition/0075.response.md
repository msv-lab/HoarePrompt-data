Output State: **`ans` is 0, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `i` is in its final state, `m` is in its final state, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `hmp` is in its final state, `t` is `t - 1`**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` sets the variable `ans` to 0. All other variables (`p`, `i`, `m`, `n`, `s`, `hmp`, `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
