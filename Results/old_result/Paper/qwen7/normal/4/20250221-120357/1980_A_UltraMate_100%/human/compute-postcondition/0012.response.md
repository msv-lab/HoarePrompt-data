Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in p`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `p`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: 
   - `i` is currently `'A'`.
   - `ans` is updated to the value of `ans` before the operation plus `m`.
   - `i` is not in `hmp`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be the next element in the iterable `p`.
   - Since `i` was `'A'` in the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be the next element in `p`.
   - The postcondition also mentions that `i` should not be in `hmp` after the loop.

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `i` will be the next element in `p` after `'A'`.
- `ans` remains unchanged as it is only updated inside the loop body, but we don't know its exact value yet.
- `i` should not be in `hmp`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `p` or the next element, we can only state that `i` will be the next element in `p` and should not be in `hmp`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is the next element in `p` (not `'A'`), `ans` is the value of `ans` before the operation plus `m`, and `i` is not in `hmp`**.
