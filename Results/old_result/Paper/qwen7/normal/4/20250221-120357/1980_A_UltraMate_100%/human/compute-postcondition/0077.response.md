Output State: **`ans` is 0, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `i` is in its final state, `m` is in its final state, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `hmp` is a Counter object containing the count of each character in the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `hmp = Counter(s)` creates a `Counter` object from the input string `s`, which counts the occurrences of each character in `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
