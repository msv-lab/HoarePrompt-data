Output State: **All characters in the string `p` ('ABCDEFG') have been iterated over, and `ans` is the initial value of `ans` (which is 0) plus `m` for each iteration where the character is not found in `hmp`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ans` will hold a value equal to `m` multiplied by the number of unique characters in the string `p` that do not appear in the string `s`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `p`, and `hmp`) will retain their final states from the last iteration of the loop.
