Output State: **`i` is 'B', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `ans` is undefined**

Explanation: The code `ans += m` attempts to increment `ans` by the value of `m`. However, `ans` is not defined in the initial state, so the code results in an error (NameError: name 'ans' is not defined). Since no valid operation was performed, the only variables mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged, and `ans` remains undefined.
