Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `p`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `p` that have not been assigned to `i`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 'A'
   - `i` is not in `hmp`
   - `ans` is the value of `ans` before the addition plus the value of `m`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is 'A' and it is not in `hmp`, the loop will continue if there are more elements in `p` that have not been assigned to `i`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in `p` after 'A'.
   - The value of `ans` remains the same as it was before the addition plus the value of `m`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be the next element in `p` after 'A'.
   - `i` is still not in `hmp`.
   - `ans` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is the next element in `p` after 'A', `i` is not in `hmp`, and `ans` is the value of `ans` before the addition plus the value of `m`**.
