Output State: **`i` is 'A', `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is the value of `ans` before the operation plus `m`.**

The code `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `m`. Since no specific initial value for `ans` was given, we only know that `ans` has been updated by adding `m` to its current value. The variables `i` and `hmp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
