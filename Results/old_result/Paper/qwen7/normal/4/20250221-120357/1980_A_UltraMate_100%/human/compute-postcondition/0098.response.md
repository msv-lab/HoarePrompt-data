Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `hmp` has at least one element.
   - `i` is the first element of `hmp`.
   - `ans` is increased by either `m - hmp[i]` (if `hmp[i] < m`) or `0` (if `hmp[i] >= m`).

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `hmp` using the variable `i`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is the first element of `hmp` at the start of the current iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be the second element of `hmp`.
   - `hmp` still has at least one element because it had at least one element before the current iteration, and removing the first element does not necessarily mean it no longer has elements.

4. **Updating `ans`:**
   - The value of `ans` depends on the comparison between `m` and `hmp[i]` for the current `i`.
   - For the next iteration, `ans` will be updated based on the new `i` (which is the second element of `hmp`).

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `hmp` still has at least one element (since the first element was removed, but there are still elements left).
   - `i` is now the second element of `hmp`.
   - `ans` will be updated based on the comparison between `m` and the new `i` (the second element of `hmp`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`hmp` has at least one element, `i` is the second element of `hmp`, and `ans` is increased by either `m - hmp[i]` (if `hmp[i] < m`) or `0` (if `hmp[i] >= m`).**
