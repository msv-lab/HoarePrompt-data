Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues:

1. **Case Sensitivity**: The output should be in lowercase ("yes" instead of "Yes").

2. **Logical Error in Condition Check**: The condition `if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:` is incorrect. This condition does not correctly determine whether Bob can always achieve a uniform color. Specifically, the logic needs to check if Alice can ensure that after Bob's repainting, the ribbon still does not have all parts of the same color.

   - If `n <= k`, Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, this means even after Bob repaints up to `k` parts, there will still be at least two different colors left.

3. **Correct Logic**:
   - Alice can ensure that Bob cannot make all parts the same color if and only if the number of parts with the same color is greater than `k`. This can be checked by ensuring that `math.ceil(n / m) > k`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if math.ceil(n / m) <= k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This version correctly checks if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.
