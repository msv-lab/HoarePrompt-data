Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for itest in range(0, t, 1):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('Yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `itest` remains 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from input split by spaces, and either `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, or `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than or equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `itest` is 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from input split by spaces. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, then the conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, the conditions also remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `itest` is 2, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `k` is the third integer entered. If `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
