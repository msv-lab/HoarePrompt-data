Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives three test cases (t) where for each test case, it takes integers n, m, and k as inputs. For each test case, if 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, it processes these inputs. The function returns different outputs based on the conditions met for each test case.**

However, since the exact output logic isn't provided in the problem statement, we can only describe the input constraints and the implied nature of the function's operation based on the given constraints.
