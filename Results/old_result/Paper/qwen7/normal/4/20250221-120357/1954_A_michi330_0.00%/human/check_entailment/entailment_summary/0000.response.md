Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify whether the logic used to decide if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color is accurate according to the problem statement.

Let's break down the logic of the program:
1. The program iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).
3. It checks two conditions:
   - If \(n \leq k\): In this case, Bob can repaint all parts, so Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts have the same color. Hence, it prints 'NO'.
   - If \(n - \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil < k\): This condition means that even after Bob repainted at most \(k\) parts, there would still be at least one color with more than \(k\) parts. Therefore, it prints 'YES'.

However, the logic for the second condition is flawed. The correct approach should be to check if the maximum number of parts that can be left with different colors after Bob repaints at most \(k\) parts is greater than 1. Specifically, if \(n > k \cdot m\), then Alice can ensure that there are at least two different colors among the parts, making it impossible for Bob to make all parts the same color.

Here is the corrected logic:
- If \(n \leq k\), print 'NO'.
- If \(n > k \cdot m\), print 'YES'.
- Otherwise, print 'NO'.

Given this analysis, the original program's logic is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the scenario where \(n > k \cdot m\). Therefore, the program will produce incorrect results for some test cases.

Correctness: **False**
