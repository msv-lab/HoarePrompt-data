Output: **Yes**

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `itest` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from input split by spaces. However, their specific values are not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- The print statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'Yes'` without referencing any of the other variables, the output is simply `'Yes'`.
