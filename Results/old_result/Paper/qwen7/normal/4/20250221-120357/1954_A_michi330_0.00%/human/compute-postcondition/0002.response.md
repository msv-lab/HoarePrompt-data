Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `itest` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. The values of `t` and `itest` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `itest` remains 0. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers obtained from the input.
