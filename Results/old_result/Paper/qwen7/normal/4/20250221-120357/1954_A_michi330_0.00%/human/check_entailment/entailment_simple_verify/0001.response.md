### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided examples.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. If `n <= k`: This condition means that if Bob can repaint at least as many parts as there are parts, he can always make all parts the same color. Hence, Alice cannot prevent this.
     2. If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`: This condition means that if the number of parts that need to be painted differently than the majority color (i.e., `math.ceil(n / m)` parts) is less than `k`, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

3. **Output:**
   - If either of the above conditions is true, the program prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

#### Testing the Conditions:

Let's test the conditions with the provided examples again:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `1 1 1`
   - `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
   - `n <= k` is true (1 <= 1)
   - Output: 'NO' (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `5 1 1`
   - `n = 5`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is true (5 - 5 < 1)
   - Output: 'NO' (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `5 2 1`
   - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 1`
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is false (5 - 3 >= 1)
   - Output: 'Yes' (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `5 2 2`
   - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 2`
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is false (5 - 3 >= 2)
   - Output: 'Yes' (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `5 5 3`
   - `n = 5`, `m = 5`, `k = 3`
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is false (5 - 1 >= 3)
   - Output: 'Yes' (Correct)

#### Detailed Explanation:

- **Condition 1 (`n <= k`):**
  - If `n <= k`, then Bob can repaint all parts, making them the same color. Thus, Alice cannot prevent this, and the output should be 'NO'.

- **Condition 2 (`n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`):**
  - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, then Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. Here, `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the minimum number of parts that must be painted in the majority color to ensure that the remaining parts can be repainted by Bob. If the difference between `n` and this value is less than `k`, Bob can still achieve his goal. Thus, the output should be 'NO'.

- **Otherwise:**
  - If neither condition is met, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. Thus, the output should be 'Yes'.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
