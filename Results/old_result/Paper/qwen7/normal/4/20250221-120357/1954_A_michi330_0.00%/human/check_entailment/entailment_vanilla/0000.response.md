Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. If `n <= k`: 
        - If this condition is true, it prints 'NO'. This means that if Bob can repaint at least as many parts as there are parts, he can always make all parts the same color.
     2. If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`:
        - If this condition is true, it also prints 'NO'. This means that if the number of parts that need to be different from the majority color (i.e., `n - math.ceil(n / m)`) is less than `k`, Bob can still make all parts the same color.

3. **Else Case:**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'Yes', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

### Reasoning:

- **Condition 1 (`n <= k`):**
  - If `n <= k`, Bob can always repaint all parts to make them the same color. Hence, this condition is correctly implemented.

- **Condition 2 (`n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`):**
  - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it means that even after Alice paints the ribbon, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. This condition is also correctly implemented.

- **Else Case:**
  - If neither condition is met, it means that either `n > k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`. In these cases, Bob cannot make all parts the same color because he does not have enough parts to repaint. Therefore, printing 'Yes' is correct.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. 

**Correctness: True**
