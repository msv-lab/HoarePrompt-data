Output State: **`a` is not empty and `a[-1]` is not 0**

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the initial state says `a[-1]` is 0, after removing this element, `a[-1]` will no longer be 0. However, `a` remains non-empty as long as there are elements left in the list.
