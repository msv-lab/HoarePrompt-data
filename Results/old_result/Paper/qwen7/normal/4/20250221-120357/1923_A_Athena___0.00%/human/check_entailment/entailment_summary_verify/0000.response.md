### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to move chips to form a single block without any free cells between them.
- The program should output the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        print(a)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- It removes leading and trailing zeros from the list.
- It counts the remaining zeros and prints both the modified list and the zero count.

#### Analysis:
1. **Removing Leading and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program correctly removes leading zeros (`a.pop(0)` while `a[0] == 0`) and trailing zeros (`a.pop()` while `a[-1] == 0`).
   
2. **Counting Remaining Zeros:**
   - The program then counts the remaining zeros in the list and prints this count.
   - This count is not the correct measure of the minimum number of operations needed.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - **Example 1:**
     ```plaintext
     Input:
     5
     8
     0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
     
     Expected Output:
     1
     
     Actual Output:
     [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]
     4
     ```
     - The program removes the leading zero and counts the remaining zeros, resulting in `4`. However, the correct answer should be `1` because moving the chip in the 7th position to the 5th position achieves the goal.

   - **Example 2:**
     ```plaintext
     Input:
     5
     1 0 1 0 1
     
     Expected Output:
     2
     
     Actual Output:
     [1, 1, 1]
     3
     ```
     - The program removes the trailing zeros and counts the remaining zeros, resulting in `3`. However, the correct answer should be `2` because moving the chips in the 2nd and 4th positions to the leftmost positions achieves the goal.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. It simply counts the remaining zeros after removing leading and trailing zeros, which does not reflect the actual minimum number of moves needed.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
**False**
