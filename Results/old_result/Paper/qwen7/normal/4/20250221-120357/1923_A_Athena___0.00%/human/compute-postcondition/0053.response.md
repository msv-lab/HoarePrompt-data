Output State: **`a` is a list without its last element, and the last element of `a` is zero**.

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the initial state mentioned that the last element of `a` is zero, after executing the code, the last element of `a` will no longer be present, but it is guaranteed that the last element of the updated list `a` is zero.
