Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - The first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) is set to the second element of the original list.
   - The length of `a` is at least 1 and less than or equal to the length of the original list minus 7.
   - The last element of `a` is 0.
   - `res` is incremented by 1 if `a[0]` was 0 in the previous iteration.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the range of the length of `a`.

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will check if `i < len(a)`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `a`.
   - After the loop increments `i` by 1, `i` will become 2.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - The condition for `res` incrementing by 1 is based on the value of `a[0]` in the previous iteration. This information is not directly updated in the loop but remains as part of the postcondition from the previous iteration.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is now 2.
   - The length of `a` remains the same.
   - The first element of `a` remains the same.
   - The last element of `a` remains 0.
   - `res` is incremented by 1 if `a[0]` was 0 in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with its first element set to the second element of the original list, the length of `a` is at least 1 and less than or equal to the length of the original list minus 7, the last element of `a` is 0, `res` is incremented by 1 if `a[0]` was 0 in the previous iteration, and `i` is 2.**
