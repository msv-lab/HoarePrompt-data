Output State: **`a` is not empty and the second element of the original `a` is now the first element of the modified `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the second element of the original `a` was 0, after popping the first element, the second element of the original list (which was 0) becomes the new first element of the list. The list `a` remains not empty, and the second element of the original `a` is now the first element of the modified `a`.
