Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `a and a[0] == 0`. This means the loop will continue as long as `a` is not empty and the first element of `a` is `0`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is that `a` is not empty and the first element of `a` is now the second element of the original `a`.

3. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to maintain the condition `a and a[0] == 0`. 

   - Since `a` is not empty, this part of the condition is already satisfied.
   - For `a[0] == 0` to remain true, the first element of `a` must still be `0`.

4. **Ensuring the First Element is 0**: After the previous iteration, the first element of `a` is the second element of the original `a`. Therefore, for the loop to continue, the second element of the original `a` must be `0`.

5. **Final State**: The state must be such that `a` is not empty and the first element of `a` (which is the second element of the original `a`) is `0`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`a` is not empty and the second element of the original `a` is 0**.
