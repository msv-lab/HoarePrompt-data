Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element set to the second element of the original list.**

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the initial state of `a` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element set to 0, after executing the code, the first element of `a` will be the second element of the original list, and the rest of the list remains unchanged.
