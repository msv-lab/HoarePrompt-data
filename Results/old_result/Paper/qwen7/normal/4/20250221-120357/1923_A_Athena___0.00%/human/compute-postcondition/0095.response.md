Based on the initial state described:

- `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
- The first element of `a` is set to the second element of the original list.
- The length of `a` is less than or equal to the length of the original list minus 7.
- The last element of `a` is 0.

Given these conditions, let's break down the elements that will be printed:

1. **First Element**: The first element of `a` is the second element of the original list.
2. **Length**: The length of `a` is at most 7 elements shorter than the original list.
3. **Last Element**: The last element of `a` is explicitly stated to be 0.

Since the exact contents of the original list are not provided, we can only describe the elements of `a` in terms of their properties as described.

Output: **[second_element_of_original_list, ..., 0]** (where the number of elements between the first and the last is at most the length of the original list minus 7, and the first element is the second element of the original list)
