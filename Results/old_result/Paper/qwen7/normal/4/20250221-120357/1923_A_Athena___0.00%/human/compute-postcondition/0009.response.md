Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `a` is not empty (`a`) and the first element of `a` is 0 (`a[0] == 0`).

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is not empty.
   - The second element of the original `a` is now the first element of the modified `a`.

3. **Determine what needs to change**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions must be true: `a` should not be empty, and `a[0]` should be 0.
   - Since `a` is already not empty (as per the current state), we need to ensure that `a[0]` is still 0.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The only way to ensure `a[0]` remains 0 is to make sure that the operation inside the loop did not change the first element of `a` from 0 to something else.
   - Given that the second element of the original `a` became the first element of the modified `a`, we need to ensure that this new first element is still 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that the first element of `a` must remain 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is not empty and the first element of `a` must be 0**
