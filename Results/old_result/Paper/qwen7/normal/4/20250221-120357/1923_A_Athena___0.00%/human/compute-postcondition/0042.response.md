Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `a and a[0] == 0`.
2. **Understand the loop head variables**: The variables involved in the loop head are `a` and `a[0]`.
3. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `t` is `t - 1`: This state is not relevant to the loop condition.
   - `n` is an input integer: This state is not relevant to the loop condition.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `res` is 0: This state is not relevant to the loop condition.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `a` must not be empty (`a` should be a non-empty list) and the first element of `a` (`a[0]`) must be 0.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `a` is a non-empty list and `a[0]` is 0.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are related to `a`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is a non-empty list and `a[0]` is 0**
