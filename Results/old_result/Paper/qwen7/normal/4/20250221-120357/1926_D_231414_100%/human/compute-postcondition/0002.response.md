Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `times`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `times` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `times` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`t` and `check`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute or not.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `times` being greater than 0.

**State:**
**`times` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `check` is 2147483647**
