### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - This function correctly handles the input and initializes variables for each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, followed by the list `a`.
   - It sorts the list `a` and then calls `func_2(k, x, a)` to get the optimal sum after Alice and Bob's moves.
   - The function prints the result for each test case.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function aims to find the optimal sum after Alice removes up to `removals` elements and Bob multiplies up to `negatives` elements by `-1`.
   - It initializes `s` as the sum of all elements in `elements`.
   - It maintains a list `pos` to store potential sums after different combinations of removals and negations.
   - It iterates through possible removals and updates `s` and `s2` accordingly, adjusting `s2` when adding back elements that were removed.
   - It appends the calculated sum `s - 2 * s2` to `pos` for each combination.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from `pos`.

Given the logic and the steps involved, both functions correctly implement the described game rules and aim to find the optimal sum after Alice and Bob make their moves.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic for the described game and accurately computes the optimal sum for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
