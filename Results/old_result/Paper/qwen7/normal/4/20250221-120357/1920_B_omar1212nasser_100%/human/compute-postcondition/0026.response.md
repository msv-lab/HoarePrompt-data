Output State: `i` is equal to `removals + 1`, `removals` must be equal to or greater than `removals`, `s` is `s` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements of `elements`, `s2` is `s2` minus the sum of the last `removals - 1` elements of `elements`, `negatives + removals` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `pos` is a list containing the value of `s - 2 * s2` repeated `removals` times, and `s2` is further adjusted by adding the elements from `elements` corresponding to the indices from `negatives + 1` to `negatives + removals`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be equal to the final value of `removals`, `s` will be reduced by the sum of the last `removals` elements of `elements`, `s2` will be reduced by the sum of the last `removals - 1` elements of `elements`, and `pos` will contain `removals` instances of the value `s - 2 * s2`.
