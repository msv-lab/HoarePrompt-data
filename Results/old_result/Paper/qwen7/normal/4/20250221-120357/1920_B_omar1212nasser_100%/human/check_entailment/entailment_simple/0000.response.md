### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - This function correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), iterates through each test case, and processes the input for each case.
   - It sorts the array `a` before calling `func_2()`, which is necessary for determining the optimal strategy.
   - After processing each test case, it prints the result returned by `func_2()`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function aims to find the optimal sum of the array after Alice and Bob's moves.
   - It initializes `s` with the sum of all elements in the array.
   - It maintains a list `pos` to store possible sums after different combinations of Alice's and Bob's moves.
   - The loop iterates up to `removals` times, updating `s` and `s2` (sum of the last `negatives + i` elements) for each iteration.
   - It calculates the potential sum `s - 2 * s2` for each combination and appends it to `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from `pos`.

3. **Optimality Consideration**:
   - Alice will remove the smallest elements to minimize the impact on the sum.
   - Bob will multiply the largest remaining elements by -1 to minimize the sum further.
   - The logic in `func_2()` considers these strategies by iterating through possible removals and updates.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where `removals` and `negatives` are equal to `len(elements)`, ensuring all elements are considered.
   - The sorting step ensures that the smallest elements are removed first, and the largest elements are multiplied by -1 last.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal sum of the array after Alice and Bob's moves.
