#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and x are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for all elements in the list.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        
        print(product)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `product` is the result of calling `func_2(k, x, a)` for each iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` (the number of test cases) must still be greater than 0. The variable `i` will be equal to `t` because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`. For each test case, `n`, `k`, and `x` will be input integers, `a` will be a sorted list of integers, and `product` will be the result of the function call `func_2(k, x, a)` for that specific test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers. It sorts the list \( a \) and then calls another function `func_2(k, x, a)` to compute a product value. Finally, it prints the computed product for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the product for each test case.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: removals is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, negatives is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and elements is a list of integers representing the array elements where 1 <= len(elements) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= elements[i] <= 1000 for all valid i.
def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:]))
    s2 = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        
        s2 -= elements[-i]
        
        if negatives + i <= len(elements):
            s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * s2)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `removals + 1`, `removals` must be greater than or equal to `removals`, `s` is `s` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements in `elements`, `s2` is `s2` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements in `elements`, `negatives + removals` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `pos` contains `removals` elements, each calculated as `s - 2 * s2`, and `s2` is adjusted by adding `elements[-(negatives + i)]` for each iteration where `negatives + i` is within the bounds of `elements`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be `removals + 1`, `s` will be the initial `s` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements in `elements`, `s2` will be the initial `s2` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements in `elements`, `negatives + removals` will be less than or equal to the length of `elements`, and `pos` will contain `removals` values, each calculated as `s - 2 * s2`.
    return max(pos)
    #The program returns the maximum value among the `removals` elements in `pos`, where each element is calculated as `s - 2 * s2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `removals` (an integer), `negatives` (an integer), and `elements` (a list of integers). It calculates a series of values based on the sum of the elements and their subsets, considering the specified number of removals and negations. After processing these calculations, it returns the maximum value among the calculated series.
