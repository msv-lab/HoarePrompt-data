Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `removals` must be greater than 0
   - `s` is `s` minus `elements[-2]`
   - `s2` is `s2` minus `elements[-2]`
   - `negatives` plus `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`
   - `pos` is `[s - 2 * s2]`
   - `s2` is updated to `s2` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)]`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, removals + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `removals`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 3 (since it starts from 1 and increments by 1).
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to 3.
   - Since `removals` must be greater than 0, it remains unchanged.
   - `s` and `s2` are updated based on the value of `elements[-2]` and `elements[-(negatives + i)]`.
   - `negatives` plus `i` is still less than or equal to the length of `elements`.
   - `pos` is updated to `[s - 2 * s2]`.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `i` is now 3
   - `removals` remains greater than 0
   - `s` is updated to `s` minus `elements[-2]`
   - `s2` is updated to `s2` plus `elements[-(negatives + 3)]`
   - `negatives` plus `3` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`
   - `pos` is `[s - 2 * s2]`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `removals` must be greater than 0, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-2]`, `s2` is `s2` plus `elements[-(negatives + 3)]`, `negatives` plus `3` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `pos` is `[s - 2 * s2]***
