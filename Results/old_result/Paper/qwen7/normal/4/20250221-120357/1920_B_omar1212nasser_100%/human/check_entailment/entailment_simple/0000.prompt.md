Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

    -5
    -9
    0
    -1
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

# Annotated Program:
func_1()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and x are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for all elements in the list.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        
        print(product)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `product` is the result of calling `func_2(k, x, a)` for each iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` (the number of test cases) must still be greater than 0. The variable `i` will be equal to `t` because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`. For each test case, `n`, `k`, and `x` will be input integers, `a` will be a sorted list of integers, and `product` will be the result of the function call `func_2(k, x, a)` for that specific test case.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: removals is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, negatives is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and elements is a list of integers representing the array elements where 1 <= len(elements) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= elements[i] <= 1000 for all valid i.
def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:]))
    s2 = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        
        s2 -= elements[-i]
        
        if negatives + i <= len(elements):
            s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * s2)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `removals + 1`, `removals` must be greater than or equal to `removals`, `s` is `s` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements in `elements`, `s2` is `s2` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements in `elements`, `negatives + removals` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `pos` contains `removals` elements, each calculated as `s - 2 * s2`, and `s2` is adjusted by adding `elements[-(negatives + i)]` for each iteration where `negatives + i` is within the bounds of `elements`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be `removals + 1`, `s` will be the initial `s` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements in `elements`, `s2` will be the initial `s2` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements in `elements`, `negatives + removals` will be less than or equal to the length of `elements`, and `pos` will contain `removals` values, each calculated as `s - 2 * s2`.
    return max(pos)
    #The program returns the maximum value among the `removals` elements in `pos`, where each element is calculated as `s - 2 * s2`.
