Output State: **`i` is 2, `removals` must be greater than 0, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-3]`, `s2` is `s2` minus `elements[-2]`, `negatives` plus `3` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `pos` is `[s - 2 * s2]**.

Explanation: The code `s2 -= elements[-i]` subtracts the value of `elements[-i]` from `s2`. Given that `i` is 2, `elements[-i]` becomes `elements[-2]`. Therefore, `s2` is updated to `s2 - elements[-2]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
