Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(1, removals + 1)`. This means `i` will take values from 1 to `removals` inclusive.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, `i` needs to be set to 1 initially.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `removals`. Therefore, `removals` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Other Variables**: The variables `pos`, `negatives`, and `s2` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `removals`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `removals` must be greater than 0**
