Postcondition: `i` is 3, `removals` must be at least 3, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-3]`, `s2` is `s2` minus `elements[-3]`, and `s2` is `s2` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)]` if `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`. If `negatives + i` is greater than the length of `elements`, the values of `s` and `s2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
