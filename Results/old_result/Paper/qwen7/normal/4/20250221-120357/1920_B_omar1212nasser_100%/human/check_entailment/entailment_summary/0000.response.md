Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that the logic implemented in the functions `func_1` and `func_2` aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples.

1. **Problem Statement Analysis**:
   - Alice can remove up to `k` elements.
   - Bob can negate up to `x` elements.
   - Alice aims to maximize the sum of the array.
   - Bob aims to minimize the sum of the array.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input values for `n`, `k`, `x`, and the array `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a` and then calls `func_2(k, x, a)` to compute the result.
   - The function prints the result for each test case but does not return any value.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes the sorted array and computes the optimal sum after Alice removes up to `k` elements and Bob negates up to `x` elements.
   - It considers different scenarios where Alice removes elements and Bob negates elements to find the maximum possible sum.
   - It calculates the sum of the array and the sum of the last `x` elements, then iteratively adjusts these sums to find the maximum possible sum after the operations.

4. **Verification with Examples**:
   - The provided examples match the logic implemented in `func_2`. For instance, in the second example, the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. If Alice removes the largest element (4) and Bob negates the smallest element (1), the resulting sum is `3 + 1 + 2 - 4 = 2`.
   - Other examples also align with the logic of removing and negating elements to achieve the optimal sum.

Given the analysis, the functions correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
