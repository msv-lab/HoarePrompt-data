Output State: **`i` is 2, `removals` must be greater than 0, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-2]`, `s2` is `s2` minus `elements[-2]`, `negatives` plus `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is updated to `s2` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `s2` by adding the value of `elements[-(negatives + i)]` to it. Since `i` is 2 and `negatives` plus `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged based on their initial conditions.
