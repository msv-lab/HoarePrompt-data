Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts considering both the regular price and the promotional price for two yogurts. The program handles different scenarios based on the value of `n` and calculates the total cost accordingly. It checks whether it's cheaper to buy all yogurts individually or to take advantage of the promotion for pairs of yogurts. The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements.
