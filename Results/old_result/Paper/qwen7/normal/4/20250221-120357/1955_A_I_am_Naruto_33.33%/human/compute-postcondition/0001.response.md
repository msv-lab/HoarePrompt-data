Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, and `b` is the third integer input.**

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation.
