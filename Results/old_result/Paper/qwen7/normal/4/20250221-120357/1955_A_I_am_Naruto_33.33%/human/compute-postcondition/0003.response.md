Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, `ans1` is `a * n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a * n` to `ans1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
