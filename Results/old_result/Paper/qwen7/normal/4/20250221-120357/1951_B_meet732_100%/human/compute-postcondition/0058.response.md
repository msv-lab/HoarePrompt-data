Functionality: **The function processes a list of distinct integers `a` and an integer `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n), where `a` represents the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. It identifies indices in the list where the value is greater than the `k-th` element of `a` and stores these indices in a list `ind`. Based on the size and content of `ind`, the function returns one of the following values:
- `n - 1` if `ind` is empty.
- `k - 1` if `ind` contains exactly one index and that index is 0.
- `ind[0] - 1` if `ind` contains exactly one index, that index is greater than `k`, and is not 0.
- The maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1` if `ind` contains exactly one index, that index is less than or equal to `k`, and is not 0.
- The minimum of the second smallest index in `ind` minus 1 and `k - 1` if `ind` contains more than one index and starts with 0.
- The maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]` if `ind` contains more than one index and does not start with 0.
- The maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]` if `ind` contains more than one index and does not start with 0.**
