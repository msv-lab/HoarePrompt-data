# Problem:
[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

# Annotated Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k -= 1
    print(func_1(l))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n.
def func_1(a):
    x = a[k]
    ind = []
    c = 0

    #State: Output State: The loop will have executed all its iterations, meaning `i` will have taken on all values from `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, `ind` will contain all indices `i` for which `a[i] > x`. The variable `c` will be equal to the number of elements in `ind`, which is the count of indices where `a[i] > x`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, `a` remains the same list of integers, and `x` remains the value of the `k-th` element of `a` (where `k` is the position of `x` in the original list `a`). If `c` reaches 2 at any point during the loop, the loop will break early, but otherwise, it will complete all iterations.
    #
    #In summary, `ind` will include all indices `i` where `a[i] > x`, `c` will be the size of `ind`, and `n`, `a`, and `x` will retain their initial values.

            return k - 1
            #The program returns k - 1, where k is the position of x in the original list a, and x is the value of the k-th element of a.
        #State: Postcondition: `ind` includes exactly one index where `a[i] > x`, `c` is the size of `ind` which is now 1, `n` remains the same list of integers, `a` remains unchanged, and `x` is the value of the `k-th` element of `a` (where `k` is the position of `x` in the original list `a`). Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list, and `ind[0]` is not equal to 0.
        if (ind[0] > k) :
            return ind[0] - 1
            #The program returns a value that is 1 less than the index stored in `ind[0]`, where `ind[0]` is the unique index in the list `ind` such that `a[ind[0]] > x` and `ind[0]` is greater than the position `k` of `x` in the original list `a`.

Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list, and `ind[0]` is not equal to 0, and `ind[0]` is less than or equal to `k`.
        return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)
        #The program returns the maximum value between k - ind[0] and ind[0] - 1, given that ind[0] is the index where a[ind[0]] > x, and ind[0] is not equal to 0 and is less than or equal to k.
    #State: `ind` includes all indices `i` where `a[i] > x`, `c` is the size of `ind`, `n` remains the same list of integers, `a` remains unchanged, and `x` is the value of the `k-th` element of `a`. Additionally, `ind` contains more than one index or is an empty list.
    if (ind[0] == 0) :
        return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)
        #The program returns the minimum value between the second smallest index in the list `ind` minus 1 and the value of `k` minus 1.
    #State: `ind` includes all indices `i` where `a[i] > x`, `c` is the size of `ind`, `n` remains the same list of integers, `a` remains unchanged, and `x` is the value of the `k-th` element of `a`. Additionally, `ind` does not start with 0.
    if (k > ind[1]) :
        return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])
        #The program returns the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (ind[1] - ind[0])
    #State: `ind` includes all indices `i` where `a[i] > x`, `c` is the size of `ind`, `n` remains the same list of integers, `a` remains unchanged, and `x` is the value of the `k-th` element of `a`. Additionally, `k` is less than or equal to `ind[1]`.
    return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])
    #The program returns the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (k - ind[0])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of distinct integers `a` and an integer `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n), where `a` represents the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. It identifies indices in the list where the value is greater than the `k-th` element of `a` and stores these indices in a list `ind`. Based on the size and content of `ind`, the function returns one of the following values:
- `n - 1` if `ind` is empty.
- `k - 1` if `ind` contains exactly one index and that index is 0.
- `ind[0] - 1` if `ind` contains exactly one index, that index is greater than `k`, and is not 0.
- The maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1` if `ind` contains exactly one index, that index is less than or equal to `k`, and is not 0.
- The minimum of the second smallest index in `ind` minus 1 and `k - 1` if `ind` contains more than one index and starts with 0.
- The maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]` if `ind` contains more than one index and does not start with 0.
- The maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]` if `ind` contains more than one index and does not start with 0.
