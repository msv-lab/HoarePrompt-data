Output State: **`a` is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and `x` is the k-th element of list `a`; `ind` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `ind`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `k`, or `x`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
