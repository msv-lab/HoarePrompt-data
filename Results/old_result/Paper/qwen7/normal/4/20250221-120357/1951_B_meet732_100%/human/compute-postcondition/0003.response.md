Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function argument `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - `i`: This variable is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
   - `n`: This variable represents the length of the list `a`.

3. **Understand the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if `i` is between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, it doesn't need adjustment.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and `x` is the k-th element of list `a`.
- `ind` is an empty list.
- `c` is 0.

We need to ensure that the loop can start executing, which means `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state should include the following:
- `n` must be greater than 0.

The final state is:
**`n` must be greater than 0**.

So, the answer is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
