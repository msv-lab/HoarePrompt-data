Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is an index within the list `a`.
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `c` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is greater than `x`.
   - The index `i` is appended to the list `ind`.
   - If `c` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` using `range(n)`.
   - Therefore, the only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is incremented within the loop, at the end of the last iteration, `i` would be `n-1`.
   - Hence, for the next iteration, `i` should be `n` (the next index).

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` needs to be set to `n` for the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range and does not change within the loop.

5. **Final State:**
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - `i` must be `n` for the next iteration.
   - `a`, `x`, `c`, and `ind` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless explicitly mentioned otherwise.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer, `c` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is greater than `x`, and the index `i` is appended to the list `ind`.**
