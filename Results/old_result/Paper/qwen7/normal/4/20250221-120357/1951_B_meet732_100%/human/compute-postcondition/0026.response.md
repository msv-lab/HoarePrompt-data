Output State: **Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer, and `c` is increased by 1. The index `i` is appended to the list `ind`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match a case in a switch statement. In this context, since the `break` statement does not modify any variables or lists, it only exits the loop or case. Therefore, the values of the variables and the state of the list `ind` remain unchanged from their preconditions.
