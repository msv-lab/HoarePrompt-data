Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a logical error in its implementation. The variables `mn` and its subsequent usage are not required and do not affect the logic of the program. However, the main issue is that the conditions for checking whether the digits form a stair or a peak are not properly nested. This means that for each test case, the program will check both conditions (`a < b < c` and `a < b > c`) independently, which can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, if both conditions are true for the same test case, it will print both "STAIR" and "PEAK", which is not expected.

To fix this, the conditions should be nested properly so that only one of the two conditions is checked per test case. Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that only one of the conditions is evaluated per test case, leading to the correct output.
