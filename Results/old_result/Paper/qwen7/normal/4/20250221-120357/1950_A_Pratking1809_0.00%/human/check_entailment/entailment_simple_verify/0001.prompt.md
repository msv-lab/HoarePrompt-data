You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` is the total number of inputs provided by the user, `i` is equal to `q`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last set of integers entered by the user, and the output consists of `q` lines each indicating whether the input triplet forms a 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions given.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `q` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: The variable `mn` is initialized to 100, but it is not used in the logic. This can be safely removed.
3. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if this condition is met.
   - It checks if `a < b > c` and prints "PEAK" if this condition is met.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where the digits do not form a stair or a peak by printing "NONE".
   - The order of conditions in the program ensures that "STAIR" and "PEAK" are printed only when their respective conditions are met.
   - There are no logical errors in the conditions or the output statements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
