Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000.
- `q` must be at least 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user.
- If `a < b < c` is true, no changes are made to `t`, `q`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

The print statement is simply `print('NONE')`. This statement will print the string `'NONE'` without any changes being made to the variables `t`, `q`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the condition `a < b < c`.

Output: **NONE**
