Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `q` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t` and `q` remain unchanged, and `i` is initialized to 0. The new variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are created with the values entered by the user.
