Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `q` is an input integer, `mn` is 100
Code of the loop:
for i in range(q):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if a < b < c:
        print('STAIR')
    if a < b > c:
        print('PEAK')
    else:
        print('NONE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `q` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user, and either the condition `a < b > c` holds (meaning `b` is greater than `a` but less than `c`), or the condition `a >= b` or `b <= c` holds.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `q` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user. Regardless of the condition `a < b > c`, the values of `t`, `q`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` must be at least 1, `i` is 3, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user, where regardless of the condition `a < b > c`, the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial values entered by the user.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
