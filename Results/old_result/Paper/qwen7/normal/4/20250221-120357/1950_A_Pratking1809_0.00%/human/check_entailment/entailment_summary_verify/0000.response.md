### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to determine if three digits \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) form a 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or neither.
- A 'STAIR' is defined as \(a < b < c\).
- A 'PEAK' is defined as \(a < b > c\).
- If neither condition is met, we output 'NONE'.

#### Program Code:
```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes `q` sets of three integers (a, b, c) where each integer is between 0 and 9 inclusive.
- It checks if the integers form a 'STAIR' (a < b < c) or a 'PEAK' (a < b > c).
- If neither condition is met, it outputs 'NONE'.
- The function prints one line for each set of integers processed, indicating whether the pattern is 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE'.
- After processing all sets, the function concludes without returning any value.

#### Original Assessment:
- Correctness: **False**.
- Explanation: The program does not handle the case where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are equal. According to the problem description, if the digits are equal, the output should be "NONE". However, the current implementation does not check for this condition. For example, if the input is `0 0 0`, the program will print "STAIR" instead of "NONE".

#### Evaluation:
1. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - The program correctly checks for the 'STAIR' condition using `if a < b < c`.
   - The program correctly checks for the 'PEAK' condition using `if a < b > c`.

2. **Handling Equality:**
   - The program does not explicitly check for the case where \(a = b = c\).
   - When \(a = b = c\), both conditions (`a < b < c` and `a < b > c`) fail, and the program falls into the `else` block which prints 'NONE'.

3. **Output Consistency:**
   - The function summary states that the function prints 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each set of integers.
   - The program's logic ensures that when \(a = b = c\), it prints 'NONE' as expected.

Given the analysis, the program correctly handles all edge cases, including when \(a = b = c\). Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final:
**True**
