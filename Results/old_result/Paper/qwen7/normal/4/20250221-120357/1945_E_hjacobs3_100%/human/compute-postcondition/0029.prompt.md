You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, and find is an integer such that 1 ≤ find ≤ n.
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
        
    #State: Output State: The list `array` is a permutation of length `n`, where `n` is greater than 1. The variables `l` and `r` are such that `r - l` is no more than 1, meaning the loop has terminated. The variable `mid` is the last calculated midpoint during the loop's execution, which is `(l + r) // 2`. Depending on the final values of `l` and `r`, either `array[l]` or `array[r]` will be the middle element of the final subarray considered during the loop's execution. The variable `find` is not directly relevant to the final state since the loop has ended, but it was used to guide the search process within `array`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the list `array` remains unchanged, and the variables `l` and `r` define a subarray of `array` with a length of 1. The `mid` value points to one of the elements in this final subarray, either `array[l]` or `array[r]`, depending on how the loop exited.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the index of `l` plus one, and the second string is the index of `find` in the list `array` plus one.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: The list `array` is a permutation of length `n`, where `n` is greater than 1. The variables `l` and `r` are such that `r - l` is exactly 1, meaning the loop has terminated. The variable `mid` is the index of the element `array[l]` or `array[r]`, which is the last calculated midpoint during the loop's execution. The variable `find` is not directly relevant to the final state since the loop has ended, but it was used to guide the search process within `array`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `array`, which is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, and a parameter `find`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`. After executing the function body, it returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the index of `find` in the list `array` plus one, and the second string is the index of `find` in the list `array` plus one.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the index of `l` plus one, and the second string is the index of `find` in the list `array` plus one.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
