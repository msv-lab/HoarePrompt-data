Output State: **The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the index of `l` plus one, and the second string is the index of `find` in the list `array` plus one.**

Given the initial state:
- `array` is a permutation of length `n` (where `n > 1`).
- `l` and `r` define a subarray of `array` with a length of 1.
- `mid` points to one of the elements in this final subarray, either `array[l]` or `array[r]`.
- `find` is not directly relevant to the final state.

The code returns:
```
[str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `l` is an index in the list `array`.
- `array.index(find)` gives the index of `find` in the list `array`.

Since `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`, `array.index(find)` will give us a valid index different from `l`.

Thus, the program returns a list containing:
- The first element is `l + 1` as a string.
- The second element is the index of `find` in `array` plus one as a string.
