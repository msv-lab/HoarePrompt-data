Output State: **`mid` is now `(l + r) // 2`, `l` remains unchanged, and `r` is equal to `mid`.**

Explanation: The code `r = mid` updates the value of `r` to be equal to the current value of `mid`. The initial state of `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`, and `l` remains unchanged. Therefore, after executing the code, `r` becomes equal to `mid`, which is `(l + r) // 2`.
