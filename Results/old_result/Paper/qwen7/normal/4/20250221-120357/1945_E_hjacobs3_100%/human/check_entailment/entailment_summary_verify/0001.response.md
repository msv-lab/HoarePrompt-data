### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires rearranging the permutation with at most 2 swaps so that the binary search on the resulting array returns the index of `x`.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic is implemented correctly. It narrows down the range `[l, r)` until it finds the position where `p_m` equals `x`. However, the current implementation has a flaw in how it handles the case where `array[l]` is already equal to `x`.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - **Case 1**: If `array[l]` is not equal to `x`, the function correctly identifies the index of `x` in the array using `array.index(find)`.
   - **Case 2**: The function then attempts to swap `array[l]` with `array[array.index(find)]` to make `p_l` equal to `x`. However, this approach assumes that the first swap will always be necessary, which is not always true. The correct approach should consider whether the first swap is needed or if the second swap is sufficient.

4. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` performs the binary search and checks if `array[l]` is equal to `x`. If not, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped. This part is correct.
   - However, the function does not handle the case where `l` is already at the correct position (`array[l] == x`). In such cases, the function incorrectly prints `1` and returns the indices, which is not necessary.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `l` is already at the correct position by returning `0` without performing any swaps. This is correct.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where `l` is not at the correct position and prints the indices of the elements to be swapped. However, the current implementation does not account for the possibility that only one swap might be needed.

6. **Output Format**:
   - The function outputs the number of swaps required followed by the indices of the elements to be swapped. This matches the problem requirements, but the logic for determining the number of swaps and the indices to be swapped is flawed.

Given the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution according to the problem statement because it does not always determine the minimum number of swaps required and may incorrectly print unnecessary swaps.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
