Postcondition: **The list `array` remains a permutation of length `n`, where `n` is greater than 1. The variables `l` and `r` define a subarray of `array` with a length of 1, and `mid` points to one of the elements in this final subarray, either `array[l]` or `array[r]`. The variable `find` is not directly relevant to the final state. The current value of `l` is such that `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`.**
