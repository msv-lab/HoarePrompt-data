Output State: The loop terminates when `r - l` is no longer greater than 1, meaning `r` equals `l + 1`. At this point, the variable `l` will be pointing to the index where `find` would fit in the sorted version of `array`, maintaining the order. The variable `r` will be `l + 1`, indicating the position right after where `find` would be inserted. The state of `array` remains unchanged, and `mid` will be the integer average of `l` and `r` during the last iteration but will not be recalculated once the loop exits.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `l` will be the index where `find` should be inserted to keep the list sorted, and `r` will be `l + 1`.
