Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` and `n` must be greater than 1; `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`; `l` is equal to `mid`, and `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`.**

The value of `l` is updated to be equal to `mid`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
