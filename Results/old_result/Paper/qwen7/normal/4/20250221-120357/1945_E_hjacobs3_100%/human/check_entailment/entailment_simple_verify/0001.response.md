### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires rearranging the permutation with at most 2 swaps so that the binary search on the resulting array returns the index of `x`.
   - The provided code uses a binary search approach to find the position of `x` in the array.

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic is implemented correctly. It narrows down the range `[l, r)` until it finds the position where `p_m` equals `x`. However, the current implementation does not ensure that the array is rearranged optimally with at most 2 swaps.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - **Case 1**: If `array[l]` is not equal to `x`, the function attempts to find the correct position of `x` in the array using `array.index(find)`.
   - **Case 2**: Once the index of `x` is found, the function prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped.
   - **Issue**: The function only considers swapping `array[l]` with `array[array.index(find)]`, which may not be the optimal solution. For example, if `array[l]` is close to `x` and swapping `array[l]` with another element might place `x` at `array[l]` without needing a second swap.

4. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` performs the binary search and checks if `array[l]` is equal to `x`. If not, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped.
   - The logic to find the correct indices for swapping is not optimal. It does not consider the possibility of swapping `array[l]` with another element closer to `x` to avoid unnecessary swaps.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `l` is already at the correct position (`array[l] == x`) by returning `0` without performing any swaps.
   - However, the function does not handle other edge cases where the optimal solution involves fewer than 2 swaps.

6. **Output Format**:
   - The function outputs the number of swaps required followed by the indices of the elements to be swapped. This matches the problem requirements, but the logic to determine the swaps is flawed.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly assumes that the provided code is correct. The function `func_1` does not guarantee that the array is rearranged optimally with at most 2 swaps. There are scenarios where the provided solution may require more than 2 swaps or may not find the optimal solution.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
