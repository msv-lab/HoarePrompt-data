Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by performing a binary search on the given permutation to find the position of the target number `x`. However, the implementation of the binary search is flawed. Specifically, the initial setup of the binary search variables `l` and `r` is incorrect, and the logic inside the binary search loop is also incorrect. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Setup**: The initial values of `l` and `r` should be set to `1` and `n+1` respectively, as per the problem statement.
2. **Binary Search Loop**: The condition `r - l > 1` should be used to continue the loop, and the midpoint `m` should be calculated as `l + (r - l) // 2` to avoid potential overflow issues with large `n`.
3. **Updating `l` and `r`**: The logic inside the loop should update `l` or `r` based on whether `p_m` is less than or equal to `x`.

Given these points, the current implementation does not correctly perform a binary search and may not find the correct position of `x` in the permutation. Additionally, the function `func_1` does not handle the case where the element at index `l` is already equal to `x`, which means the binary search might not terminate properly.

Since the provided code does not correctly implement the binary search and does not address the requirement to perform at most 2 swaps, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
