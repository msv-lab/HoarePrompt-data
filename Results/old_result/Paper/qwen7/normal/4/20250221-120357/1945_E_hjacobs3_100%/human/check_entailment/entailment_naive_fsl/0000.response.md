Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not ensure that the element `x` is placed at the position `l` after performing at most two swaps. Let's consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 2
  4 3 1 2
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  1 4
  2 3
  ```

However, the program outputs:
```
0
```

This is because the program only checks if the middle element `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find` and updates `l` or `r` accordingly. It does not ensure that the element `x` is moved to the position `l` by performing at most two swaps. The program fails to handle cases where the initial position of `x` is not at the midpoint and requires more than one swap to place `x` at the correct position.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
