#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, and find is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ find â‰¤ n.
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
        
    #State: Output State: The list `array` is a permutation of length `n`, where `n` is greater than 1. The variables `l` and `r` are such that `r - l` is no more than 1, meaning the loop has terminated. The variable `mid` is the last calculated midpoint during the loop's execution, which is `(l + r) // 2`. Depending on the final values of `l` and `r`, either `array[l]` or `array[r]` will be the middle element of the final subarray considered during the loop's execution. The variable `find` is not directly relevant to the final state since the loop has ended, but it was used to guide the search process within `array`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the list `array` remains unchanged, and the variables `l` and `r` define a subarray of `array` with a length of 1. The `mid` value points to one of the elements in this final subarray, either `array[l]` or `array[r]`, depending on how the loop exited.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the index of `l` plus one, and the second string is the index of `find` in the list `array` plus one.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: The list `array` is a permutation of length `n`, where `n` is greater than 1. The variables `l` and `r` are such that `r - l` is exactly 1, meaning the loop has terminated. The variable `mid` is the index of the element `array[l]` or `array[r]`, which is the last calculated midpoint during the loop's execution. The variable `find` is not directly relevant to the final state since the loop has ended, but it was used to guide the search process within `array`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `array` representing a permutation of length `n` and an integer `find` such that `1 â‰¤ find â‰¤ n`. It performs a binary search on `array` to locate `find`. If `find` is not equal to the element at index `l`, it prints `1` and returns a list containing the index of `l` plus one and the index of `find` in `array` plus one. Otherwise, it prints `0` and no value is returned. The list `array` remains unchanged after the function executes.
