Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers entered by the user.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is determined by the postcondition and does not change within the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\)).
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1.
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers entered by the user.**
