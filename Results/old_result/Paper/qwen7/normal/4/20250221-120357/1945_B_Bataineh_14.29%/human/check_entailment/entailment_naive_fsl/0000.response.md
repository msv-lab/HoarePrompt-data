Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the time a firework is visible (m) is less than both a and b. According to the problem description, if \( m < a \) or \( m < b \), the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time should be 2. However, the program incorrectly calculates the result using \( m // a + m // b + 2 \) even when \( m < a \) or \( m < b \).

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 2 1
```

The expected output is 2 because the first installation launches a firework every 1 minute, and the second installation launches a firework every 2 minutes. Each firework is visible for 1 minute, so at most 2 fireworks can be seen simultaneously (one from each installation).

However, the program will calculate:
```
print(1 // 1 + 1 // 2 + 2) = 1 + 0 + 2 = 3
```

This is incorrect because the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2, not 3. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
