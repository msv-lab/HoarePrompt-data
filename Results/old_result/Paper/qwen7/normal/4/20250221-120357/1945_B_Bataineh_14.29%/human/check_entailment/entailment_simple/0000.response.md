Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.
3. The logic to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is correct:
   - If `m < a` or `m < b`, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2 because the time interval between launches of the same installation would be shorter than the visibility period.
   - Otherwise, the formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is used to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. This formula accounts for the fact that fireworks from different installations can overlap their visibility periods, and the `+2` accounts for the possibility of simultaneous launches from both installations within the visibility period.

Given the provided example and the explanation of the problem, the program's logic matches the requirements and the conditions provided.

Correctness: **True**
