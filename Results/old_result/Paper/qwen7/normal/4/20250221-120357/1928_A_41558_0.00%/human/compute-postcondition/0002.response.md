Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the first integer entered by the user, `b` is the second integer entered by the user.**

The code splits the input into two integers and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `n` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the new variables `a` and `b` with the values provided by the user.
