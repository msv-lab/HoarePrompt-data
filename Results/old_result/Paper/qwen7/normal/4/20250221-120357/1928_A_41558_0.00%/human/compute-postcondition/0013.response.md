Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is the first integer entered by the user.
- `b` is the second integer entered by the user.
- Neither `a` nor `b` is half of the other.

The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, or `b`, and only outputs a fixed string, the output will be:

Output: **'YES'**
