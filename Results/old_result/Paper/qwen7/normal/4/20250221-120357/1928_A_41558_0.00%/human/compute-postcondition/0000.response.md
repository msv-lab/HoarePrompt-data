Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it takes an integer input from the user. The value of `t` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^4.
