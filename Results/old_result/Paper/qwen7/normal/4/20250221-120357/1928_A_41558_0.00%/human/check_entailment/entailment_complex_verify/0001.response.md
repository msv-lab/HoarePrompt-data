### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program and the conditions it uses to determine if a rectangle can be divided into two smaller rectangles.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.

2. **Conditions for "NO":**
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` are odd (`a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`). If both dimensions are odd, it prints 'NO'. This is correct because an odd-sized rectangle cannot be divided into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
   - The program also checks if either half of the dimensions equals the other dimension (`a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a`). This condition is indeed restrictive and needs further analysis.

3. **Condition for "YES":**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'YES'. This is generally correct, but we need to ensure that the logic covers all possible scenarios where a rectangle can be divided into two smaller rectangles.

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- **Odd Dimensions:** If both `a` and `b` are odd, the rectangle cannot be divided into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. This part is correct.
- **Equal Halves:** The condition `a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` is indeed restrictive. However, it does not cover all cases where a rectangle can be divided into two smaller rectangles. For example, a `2 \times 6` rectangle can be divided into two `2 \times 3` rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a `4 \times 3` rectangle. This means the condition `a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` should be expanded to include more cases.

### Expanded Condition:
To correctly identify all cases where a rectangle can be divided into two smaller rectangles, we need to check if either `a` or `b` is even and the other dimension can be split into two smaller integer dimensions. This can be done by checking if either `a` or `b` is even and the other dimension can be split into two smaller integers.

### Revised Logic:
1. Check if both `a` and `b` are odd. If so, print 'NO'.
2. Check if either `a` or `b` is even and the other dimension can be split into two smaller integers. If so, print 'YES'.
3. If none of the above conditions are met, print 'NO'.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 != 0 and b // 2 > 0:
            print('YES')
        elif b % 2 == 0 and a % 2 != 0 and a // 2 > 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was inaccurate because it did not fully consider all cases where a rectangle can be divided into two smaller rectangles. By expanding the condition to check if either dimension is even and the other can be split into two smaller integers, the program can correctly identify all valid cases.

Final: **True**
