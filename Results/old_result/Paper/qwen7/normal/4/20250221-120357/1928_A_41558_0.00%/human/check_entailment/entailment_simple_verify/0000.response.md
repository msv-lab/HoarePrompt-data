### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

#### Annotated Code:
- The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
- It then iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions `a` and `b`.
- It checks if both `a` and `b` are odd. If so, it prints 'NO'.
- It checks if `a / 2` equals `b` or `b / 2` equals `a`. If so, it prints 'NO'.
- Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

#### Original Assessment:
- **Correctness: False**
- Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where one dimension is 1 and the other is greater than 1. For example, a 1 Ã— 4 rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle.

#### Analysis:
1. **Case 1: Both Dimensions are Odd**
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program correctly prints 'NO' because no even dimensions can be formed.
   
2. **Case 2: One Dimension is 1 and the Other is Greater than 1**
   - If one dimension is 1 and the other is greater than 1, the program should print 'NO'. However, the current implementation does not check this condition.
   - Example: `1 4` should print 'NO', but the current implementation might print 'YES' because it does not check if one dimension is 1.

3. **Case 3: Dimensions are Even and Not Equal to Each Other Halves**
   - If the dimensions are even and not equal to each other halves, the program correctly prints 'YES' because it can be cut into two rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle.
   - Example: `2 6` should print 'YES', and the current implementation correctly prints 'YES'.

4. **Case 4: Dimensions are Equal to Each Other Halves**
   - If the dimensions are equal to each other halves, the program correctly prints 'NO' because no new distinct rectangle can be formed.
   - Example: `2 4` should print 'NO', and the current implementation correctly prints 'NO'.

#### Updated Program:
To fix the issue, we need to add a condition to check if one dimension is 1 and the other is greater than 1.

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a == 1 or b == 1:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The given program does not correctly handle the case where one dimension is 1 and the other is greater than 1. Therefore, the original assessment should be maintained.

**Final: False**
