Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is equal to `n-1`. The variable `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The variable `n` is the total number of iterations the loop was set to run, which must be greater than 0. The variables `a` and `b` are the integers entered by the user on the last iteration of the loop. After the final iteration, if `a` and `b` are both odd, the loop prints 'NO' and does not change their values. If `a / 2` equals `b` or `b / 2` equals `a`, the loop also prints 'NO' and does not change their values. In all other cases, the loop prints 'YES'. The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop executions.
