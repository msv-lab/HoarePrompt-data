Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives test cases where each test case contains a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and for each `t`, two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function returns information based on the values of `a` and `b`.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing three integers (`t`, `a`, and `b`). It does not return a single value but rather processes each test case individually, returning different outputs based on the values of `a` and `b` for each `t`.
