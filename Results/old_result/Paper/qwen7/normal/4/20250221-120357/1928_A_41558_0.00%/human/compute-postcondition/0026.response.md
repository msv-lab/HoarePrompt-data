Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers entered by the user, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `t` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes two integers as input from the user and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged from their previous states.
