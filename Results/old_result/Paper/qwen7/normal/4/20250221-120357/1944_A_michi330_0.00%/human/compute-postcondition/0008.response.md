Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `k` is less than `n - 1`.

The `print(n - 1)` statement will print the value of `n - 1`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `n - 1`. However, we know it will be one less than the value of `n`.

Output: **n - 1 (where n is an input integer)**
