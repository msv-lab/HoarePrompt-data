Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `t`, and the range parameters (which are not explicitly named but can be inferred as part of the range function).

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `t-1` with a step of `1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then no change is made to `t`.
   - If `k` is less than `n - 1`, then no change is made to `t` either.

4. **Analyze the Loop Execution**:
   - Since the postcondition does not mention any changes to `t`, `n`, or `k`, these values remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.
   - The only variable that can change within the loop is `i`, which starts at `0` and increments by `1` each iteration until it reaches `t`.

5. **Determine the New State for the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by `1`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `1` if it was `0` before, or `2` if it was `1` before, and so on.
   - The value of `t` remains the same because no changes were made to it according to the postcondition.

6. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `t` remains the same.
   - `i` is incremented by `1` from its previous value.
   - `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Given this analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.
