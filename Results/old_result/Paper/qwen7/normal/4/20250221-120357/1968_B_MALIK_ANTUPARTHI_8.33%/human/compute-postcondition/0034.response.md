Output State: **`k` is an index, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is the first integer input from the user, `j` is equal to `b - 1`, `c` is the second integer input from the user, `d` is the third integer input from the user, `e` is an input from the user. If `d[j]` (which is `d[b-1]`) is found in the sublist `e[k:]`, then `k` is the index of `d[b-1]` in `e` plus `k`. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is set to `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `j` will be equal to `b - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `b-1`. The value of `k` will depend on whether `d[b-1]` is found in `e[k:]` and where it is found, or if the loop breaks due to `k` equaling `c` or `j` reaching `b-1`.
