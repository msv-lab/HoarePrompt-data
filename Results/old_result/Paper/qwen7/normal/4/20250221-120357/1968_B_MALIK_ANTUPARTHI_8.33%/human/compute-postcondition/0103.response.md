Output State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `k` is `j`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the initial state, the only effect is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `b`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
