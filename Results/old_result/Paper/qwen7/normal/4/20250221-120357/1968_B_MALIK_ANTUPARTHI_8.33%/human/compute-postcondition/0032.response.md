Output State: **`k` is equal to `j` + 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is the first integer input from the user, `j` is incremented by 1, `c` is the second integer input from the user, `d` is the third integer input from the user, `e` is an input from the user, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `j` was being incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial states as no changes were made to them within the scope of the `break` statement.
