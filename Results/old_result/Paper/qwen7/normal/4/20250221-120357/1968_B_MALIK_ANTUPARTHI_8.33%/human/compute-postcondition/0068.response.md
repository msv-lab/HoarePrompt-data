Output State: **`j` is 3, `b` must be greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `j`, `b`, and `k`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since no variables are reassigned or altered by the `break` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
