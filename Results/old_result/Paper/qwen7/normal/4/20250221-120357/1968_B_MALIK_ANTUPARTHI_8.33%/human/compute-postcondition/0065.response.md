The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `b`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `b`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `b`. Therefore, `j` should be incremented by 1, making it 3.

Since the loop condition is based on `j < b`, and no information about `b` is provided other than it must allow `j` to be incremented to 3, `b` must be greater than or equal to 3.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`j` is 3, `b` must be greater than or equal to 3**
