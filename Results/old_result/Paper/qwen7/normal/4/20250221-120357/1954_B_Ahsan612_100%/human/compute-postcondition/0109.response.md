Output State: **`i` is 2, `ar` is a list of integers created from the input with its length greater than 1, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `n` is an input integer, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The line `same = 1` does not change the value of `i`, `ar`, `minn`, `n`, `same`, or `num`. It only updates `same` to be 1. Since `ar[i]` was previously not equal to `num`, and now `same` is set to 1 without changing `num` or `ar[i]`, `ar[i]` must now be equal to `num` to satisfy the condition.
