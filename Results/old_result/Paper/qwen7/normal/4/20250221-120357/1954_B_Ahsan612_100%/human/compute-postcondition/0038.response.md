Output State: `same` is between 1 and 5 (inclusive), `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1, `num` is the last value assigned to `ar[i]` during the loop execution, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop execution, and `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `same` will hold the maximum consecutive count of the same number in the list `ar`. The variable `minn` will store the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `ar` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of the list. The values of `t`, `n`, and `ar` remain unchanged as they were not modified within the loop. The variable `num` will be the last number in the list `ar` that was checked during the loop execution.
