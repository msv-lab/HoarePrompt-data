Output State: **`same` is 1, `minn` is the minimum of its original value and 1, `i` is 2**.

Explanation: The line `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum between its current value and the value of `same`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
