Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer inputted by the user, `ar` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between `minn` and `same` encountered during the loop, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, and `minn` is the smallest value between its original value and the current value of `same`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `ar` to the variable `num`. The value of `same` remains 1, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `ar` remains unchanged (except that `num` is now set to the first element), `minn` remains unchanged (as no comparison with `same` has been made yet), and `i` remains equal to the length of `ar`.
