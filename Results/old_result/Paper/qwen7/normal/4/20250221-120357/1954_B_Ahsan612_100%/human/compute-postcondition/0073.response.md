Postcondition: `same`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` are as follows:
- `same` is either 3 or 1.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the integer inputted by the user.
- `ar` is a list with more than 3 elements.
- `num` is the first element of the list `ar`.
- `minn` is the minimum of its original value and 2.
- `i` is 4 if `ar[2]` is not equal to `num`, otherwise `i` is 2.
