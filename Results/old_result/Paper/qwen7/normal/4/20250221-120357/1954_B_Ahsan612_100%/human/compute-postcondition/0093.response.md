Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved here are:
   - `_`: A placeholder variable used to iterate over the range of input values.
   - `input()`: This function reads an integer from the user.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - The loop will continue as long as the input value is positive (greater than 0).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `minn` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`.
   - If `minn` is infinity or equals the length of the list `ar`, it remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `same`.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - The loop will execute again if the input value is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, the input value must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Given these points, we can conclude that the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input value, which must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`minn` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`, and the input value must be greater than 0**.
