Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer inputted by the user, `ar` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, and `minn` is the smallest value between its original value and the current value of `same`.**

Explanation: The line `minn = inf` sets the variable `minn` to infinity. This does not affect any other variables, so their states remain unchanged. The value of `minn` is now explicitly set to infinity, which is the smallest value between its original value (which was `same`, thus 1) and the current value of `same` (which is still 1).
