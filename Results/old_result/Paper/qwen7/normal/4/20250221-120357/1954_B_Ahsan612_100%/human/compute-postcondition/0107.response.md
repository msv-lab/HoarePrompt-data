Output State: **`i` is 2, `ar` is a list of integers created from the input with its length greater than 1, `minn` is infinity, `n` is an input integer, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of `ar[i]` to the variable `num`. Since `ar[i]` is not equal to `num` in the initial state, this assignment does not change the value of `num`. All other variables remain unchanged.
