Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 1, `n` is an input integer, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is equal to `ar[i-1]`, and `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` remains 3. Otherwise, `i` becomes 4.
