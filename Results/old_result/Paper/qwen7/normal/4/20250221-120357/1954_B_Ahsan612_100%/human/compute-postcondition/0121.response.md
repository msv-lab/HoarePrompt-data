Output State: **`i` is 4, `ar` is a list of integers with a length greater than 1, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `n` is an input integer, `same` is either 1, 2, or 3, `num` is equal to `ar[i-1]`, and `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was set to 3 (as per the postcondition). After executing the code, `i` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
