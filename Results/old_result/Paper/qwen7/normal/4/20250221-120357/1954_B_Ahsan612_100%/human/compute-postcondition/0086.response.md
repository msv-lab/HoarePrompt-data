Output State: `same` is the total number of occurrences of the most frequent element in the list `ar`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer inputted by the user, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`, `i` is the index of the next element in `ar` to be processed.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `same` will hold the highest count of consecutive occurrences of any single element in the list `ar`. The variable `minn` will be the minimum of these counts. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, and `i` will remain as they were after the last iteration of the loop, with `i` pointing to the next element in the list to be processed or indicating the end of the list if all elements have been checked.
