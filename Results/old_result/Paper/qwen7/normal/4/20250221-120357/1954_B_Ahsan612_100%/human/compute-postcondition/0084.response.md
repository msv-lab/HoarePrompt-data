Output State: **`same`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` retain their initial values, `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was initially holding some value (let's call it `initial_i`), after executing the code, `i` will now hold `initial_i + 1`. However, no other variables (`same`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`) are affected by this operation. Therefore, they retain their initial values.
