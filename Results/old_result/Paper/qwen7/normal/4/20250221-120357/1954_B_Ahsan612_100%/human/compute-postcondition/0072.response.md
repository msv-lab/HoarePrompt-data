Output State: **`same` is 1, `minn` is the minimum of its original value and 2, `i` is 4 if `ar[2]` is not equal to `num`, otherwise `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The variable `same` is directly assigned the value `1`. The other variables (`minn` and `i`) are not affected by this assignment, so their states remain as they were initially. Specifically, `minn` is still the minimum of its original value and 2, and `i` remains 4 if `ar[2]` is not equal to `num`, otherwise `i` is 2.
