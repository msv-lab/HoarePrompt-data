Output State: **`same` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `i` is 5, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num` if `same` is 2. If `same` is 1, `ar[i]` is not equal to `num` where `i` is 4.**

Explanation: The value of `same` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged based on the given conditions and their initial states.
