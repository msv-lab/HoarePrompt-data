Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1, `num` is `ar[3]`, `minn` is set to infinity, `i` is 3, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `num` to be the value of `ar[i]`, where `i` is 3. Therefore, `num` is now `ar[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
