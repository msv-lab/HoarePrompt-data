Output State: **`minn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `same`, `i` is increased by 1, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`, `same`, `t`, `n`, and `ar` retain their initial values.**

Explanation: The line `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum between its current value and the value of `same`. The other variables (`i`, `num`, `same`, `t`, `n`, and `ar`) are not affected by this line of code.
