Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and a list `a` of `n` integers (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function then returns different outputs based on the values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a`.**

This means the function iterates through multiple test cases, each defined by `t`, `n`, and a list `a`. It processes these inputs and produces outputs according to the given conditions, but the specific nature of the output is not detailed here.
