Output State: **`i` is equal to its original value plus 1; `ar` is a list of integers with a length greater than 1; `num` is the integer at index `i` in the list `ar`; `minn` is the minimum value between `minn` and `same`; `same` is 1.**

The code `same = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `same`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
