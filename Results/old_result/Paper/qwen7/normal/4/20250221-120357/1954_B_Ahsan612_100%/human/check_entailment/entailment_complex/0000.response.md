Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array to find the smallest number of consecutive identical elements. However, the logic in the program is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly identify whether the array is beautiful according to the given definition and does not calculate the minimum number of elements to remove accurately.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Consecutive Identical Elements**: The program tries to find the smallest number of consecutive identical elements but does not properly handle the condition where an element can be replaced with the previous element if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\). This means the program might incorrectly identify sequences that do not need to be removed.

2. **Misinterpretation of "Beautiful" Array**: The program assumes that finding the smallest number of consecutive identical elements directly translates to the minimum number of elements to remove. However, the problem requires checking if the array can become non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements. The current logic does not account for this.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as arrays with only one element or arrays where no elements can be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
