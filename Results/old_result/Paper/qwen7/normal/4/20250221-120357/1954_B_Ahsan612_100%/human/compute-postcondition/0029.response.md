Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head is `while i < len(ar):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(ar)`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `same` is 3 or 1.
   - `t` is as before.
   - `n` is as before.
   - `ar` is as before.
   - `num` is as before.
   - `minn` is 2 or unchanged.
   - `i` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.
   - Since `i` is increased by 1 from the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `i + 1 < len(ar)`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - We need to ensure that `i + 1 < len(ar)`.
   - Given that `i` was increased by 1, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.

5. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - `i` is now `i + 1`.
   - To ensure the loop executes, `i + 1` must be less than `len(ar)`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`same` is 3 or 1, `t` is as before, `n` is as before, `ar` is as before, `num` is as before, `minn` is 2 or unchanged, and `i + 1` is less than `len(ar)`**
