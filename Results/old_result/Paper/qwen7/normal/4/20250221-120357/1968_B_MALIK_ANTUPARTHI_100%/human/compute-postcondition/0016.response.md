Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is a string input from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `k` is equal to `j`, `j` is between 0 and `b`-1 inclusive, and the character at index `j` in `d` is not present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`.**

This means that the variable `k` has been updated to hold the value of `j`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
