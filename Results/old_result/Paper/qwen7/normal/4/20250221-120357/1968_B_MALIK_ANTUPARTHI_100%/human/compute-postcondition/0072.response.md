Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j` and `b`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j < b`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` is greater than 0.
   - `j` is `b-1`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` is currently `b-1`, the next value of `j` would be `b-1 + 1 = b`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `b`. Therefore, `j` needs to be reset to 0.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` should be reset to 0.
   - `b` remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop head.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The new state should reflect that `j` is now 0 and `b` remains greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `b` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
