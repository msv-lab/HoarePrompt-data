Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 1, `b` is the first integer input from the user, `c` is the second integer input from the user, `d` is a string input from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `j` is `b`, `k` is `b + 1` or `b`, `d` is a new string input from the user.**

The code `d = input()` assigns a new string input from the user to the variable `d`. All other variables retain their previous values.
