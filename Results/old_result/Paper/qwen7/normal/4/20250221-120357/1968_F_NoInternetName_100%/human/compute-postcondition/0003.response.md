Output State: **`inds` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^{30}, `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n for each query, `x` is a list containing the single element 0.**

The code initializes a defaultdict named `inds` with the default factory set to `list`. This means that `inds` can be accessed with keys that do not exist yet, and it will automatically create an empty list for those keys. The values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
