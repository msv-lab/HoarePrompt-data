Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2.
- `q` must be greater than 0 (though its exact value is not specified).
- `l` is the result of `func_1(int)`. Since no specific function or input is provided for `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact value of `l`.
- `r` is the result of `func_1(int)`. Similarly, we cannot determine the exact value of `r` without more information about `func_1`.
- `upper` is the result of `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`. Here, `x[l - 1]` would refer to the element in the list `x` at the index `l - 1`. The exact value of `upper` depends on the contents of `inds` and the result of `func_3`.

However, the print statement is simply:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement will print the string "No" regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **No**
