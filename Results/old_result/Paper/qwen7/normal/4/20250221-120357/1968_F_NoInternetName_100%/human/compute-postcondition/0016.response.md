Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are the results of `func_1(int)`**

Explanation: The code `l, r = func_1(int)` calls the function `func_1` with an integer argument (the value of `int` is not specified in the initial state). This function returns two values, which are assigned to `l` and `r`. The values of `i` and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states.
