Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in a`.
   - The relevant variables here are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the state changes from the previous iteration:**
   - `x` is a list where the last element is updated to the value of the last element of `x` XORed with `i`.
   - `inds[x[-1]]` now contains the length of `x` - 1.

3. **Understand the conditions for the next iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be the next element in the sequence `a`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly:**
   - Since `i` is taken from the sequence `a`, the next value of `i` will be the next element in `a`.
   - The state of `x` and `inds` does not change based on the loop head but rather on the loop body. Therefore, we do not need to adjust these states for the loop to execute again.

5. **Formulate the new state:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `i`, which will be the next element in `a`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is the next element in `a`**
