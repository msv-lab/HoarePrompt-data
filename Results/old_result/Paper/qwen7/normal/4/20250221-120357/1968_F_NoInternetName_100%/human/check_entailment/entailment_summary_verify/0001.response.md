### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires checking if a subarray can be divided into `k` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is the same. The solution uses prefix XOR to simplify this check.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - A prefix XOR array `x` is constructed where `x[i] = a[0] ^ a[1] ^ ... ^ a[i-1]`.
   - If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, it means the subarray `a[l:r]` has a bitwise XOR of 0, which can be split into parts with the same XOR value trivially.
   - Otherwise, we need to find indices where the prefix XOR matches the required value to split the subarray.

3. **Binary Search Functions (`func_2` and `func_4`)**:
   - These functions perform binary search to find the first index where the condition holds.
   - However, these functions are not used in the main logic of `func_5`. Instead, `func_3` and `func_5` use direct list operations, which is more straightforward and efficient for this problem.

4. **Main Logic (`func_5`)**:
   - The function reads the input values `n` and `q`.
   - It constructs the prefix XOR array `x` and stores indices in a dictionary `inds`.
   - For each query `(l, r)`, it checks if `x[l-1] == x[r]` directly.
   - If not, it finds the lower and upper bounds using the stored indices and checks if they can form valid splits.

5. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The code correctly handles the construction of the prefix XOR array and the storage of indices.
   - The logic for checking the subarray's interesting property is implemented correctly.
   - The binary search functions are not necessary and could be simplified.

6. **Function Summaries**:
   - The summaries indicate that `func_5` processes queries by checking if the prefix XOR values match, which aligns with the problem requirements.
   - The summaries also confirm that the function correctly identifies if a subarray is interesting by comparing prefix XOR values.

Given the analysis and the function summaries, the original assessment is accurate. The code correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the given problem description. There are no logical errors or inefficiencies in the implementation.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
