Output State: **`inds[x[-1]]` now includes the value `len(x)`, `i` is the next element in `a`, `x` is a list where the last element is `x[-1] ^ i ^ i`, and `x` has an additional element which is `x[-1] ^ i`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `inds[x[-1]]` includes the value `len(x) - 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `len(x)`.
- The code appends `len(x) - 1` (which is `len(x)` since `-1 + 1` cancels out) to `inds[x[-1]]`.
- The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
- Therefore, the updated state is as described above.
