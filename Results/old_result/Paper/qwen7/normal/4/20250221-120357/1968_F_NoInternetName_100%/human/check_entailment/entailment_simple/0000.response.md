### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers. It correctly handles the input and returns a map object which is later converted to a list.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function performs a binary search to find the leftmost index where the predicate is true. The logic is correct, but there's a minor issue: the function returns `None` when the predicate is never true, which might not be ideal for this problem. However, the function is used correctly in subsequent functions.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function simply calls `func_2` and returns its result. The logic is correct.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: This function finds the leftmost index where the predicate is true and adds 1 to it. If no such index exists, it returns `None`. The logic is correct.

5. **Function 5 (`func_5`)**: 
   - Reads `n` and `q` from input.
   - Constructs the cumulative XOR list `x` and a dictionary `inds` that maps each cumulative XOR value to a list of indices where that value occurs.
   - For each query, it checks if the cumulative XOR from `l-1` to `r` is zero (which means the subarray is interesting).
   - If not, it uses binary search to find the appropriate indices in the dictionary `inds` to check if a valid split exists.
   - The logic for checking the split is correct.

### Analysis:
- The overall structure of the program is correct.
- The use of binary search and cumulative XOR is appropriate for solving the problem efficiently.
- The logic for determining if a subarray is interesting is sound.

### Conclusion:
The annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is correct.
