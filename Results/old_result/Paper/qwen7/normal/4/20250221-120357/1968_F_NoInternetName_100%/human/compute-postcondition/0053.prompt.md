Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is a list where each element is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `a` up to that point, and `inds[x[-1]]` is a list containing all indices of elements in `x`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(q):
    l, r = func_1(int)
    if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
        print('Yes')
        continue
    lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
    upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
    if upper > lower:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are the results of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the result of `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`. If `upper` is greater than `lower`, the condition holds as is. If `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`, the condition also holds accordingly.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is the result of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the result of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the value from `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`. The overall postcondition remains unchanged as both the if and else parts do not alter the values of `i`, `q`, `l`, `r`, and `upper`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is the result of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the result of `func_1(int)`, and `upper` is updated to the value of `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]` regardless of the condition `upper > lower`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
