Postcondition: `i` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are the results of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the result of `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`. If `upper` is greater than `lower`, the condition holds as is. If `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`, the condition also holds accordingly.
