Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the value `len(x) - 1`.
   - `i` is the next element in `a`.
   - `x` is a list where the last element is `x[-1] ^ i`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in `a`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `a` after the current `i`.
   - The variable `x` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop body is omitted and no changes are made to `x` within the loop.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `inds[x[-1]]` will still include the value `len(x) - 1` because `x` does not change.
   - `i` will be the next element in `a` after the current `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`inds[x[-1]]` now includes the value `len(x) - 1`, `i` is the next element in `a`, and `x` is a list where the last element is `x[-1] ^ i`**.
