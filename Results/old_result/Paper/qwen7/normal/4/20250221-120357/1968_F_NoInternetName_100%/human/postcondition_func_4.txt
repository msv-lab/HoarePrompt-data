The function accepts two positive integers \( n \) and \( q \), a list of integers \( a \), and processes \( q \) queries. For each query, it checks if there exists an index \( k \) in the range \( l \leq k < r \) such that the cumulative XOR from the start of the list up to index \( k \) is equal to the cumulative XOR from the start of the list up to index \( r \). If such an index exists, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all queries, the function does not return any value.
