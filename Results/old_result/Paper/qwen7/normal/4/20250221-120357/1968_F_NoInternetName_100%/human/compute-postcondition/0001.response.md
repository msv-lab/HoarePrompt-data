Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^{30}, `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n for each query, and `a` is now a list of integers returned by `func_1(int)`**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(func_1(int))` calls the function `func_1` with an integer argument, and assigns the result to the list `a`. The values of `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states. The list `a` is updated to contain the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
