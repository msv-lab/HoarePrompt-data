You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

from collections import defaultdict
#Function 1:
def func_1(cast):
    return map(cast, input().split())

#Function 2:
def func_2(arr, predicate):
    (l, r) = (0, len(arr))
    while l + 1 < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if predicate(arr[mid]):
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if predicate(arr[l]):
        return l
    return None

    return func_2(arr, predicate)

#Function 4:

        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
    for i in range(q):
        (l, r) = func_1(int)
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
        if upper > lower:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function accepts two positive integers \( n \) and \( q \), a list of integers \( a \), and processes \( q \) queries. For each query, it checks if there exists an index \( k \) in the range \( l \leq k < r \) such that the cumulative XOR from the start of the list up to index \( k \) is equal to the cumulative XOR from the start of the list up to index \( r \). If such an index exists, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all queries, the function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires checking if a subarray can be divided into `k` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is the same. The solution uses prefix XOR to simplify this check.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - A prefix XOR array `x` is constructed where `x[i] = a[0] ^ a[1] ^ ... ^ a[i-1]`.
   - If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, it means the subarray `a[l:r]` has a bitwise XOR of 0, which can be split into parts with the same XOR value trivially.
   - Otherwise, we need to find indices where the prefix XOR matches the required value to split the subarray.

3. **Binary Search Functions (`func_2` and `func_4`)**:
   - These functions perform binary search to find the first index where the condition holds.
   - However, these functions are not used in the main logic of `func_5`. Instead, `func_3` and `func_5` use direct list operations, which is more straightforward and efficient for this problem.

4. **Main Logic (`func_5`)**:
   - The function reads the input values `n` and `q`.
   - It constructs the prefix XOR array `x` and stores indices in a dictionary `inds`.
   - For each query `(l, r)`, it checks if `x[l-1] == x[r]` directly.
   - If not, it finds the lower and upper bounds using the stored indices and checks if they can form valid splits.

5. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The code correctly handles the construction of the prefix XOR array and the storage of indices.
   - The logic for checking the subarray's interesting property is implemented correctly.
   - The binary search functions are not necessary and could be simplified.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the given problem description. There are no logical errors or inefficiencies in the implementation.
