The function processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer \( n \) (the size of the list \( p \)), followed by a list \( p \) of \( n \) integers. For each element in the list \( p \), it checks if the value at the index specified by \( p[i] - 1 \) equals \( i + 1 \). If this condition is met for any element, it prints `2`. If the condition is never met for any element, it prints `3` after processing all elements. The function does not return any value but outputs the result for each test case.
