Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\) and all \(p_i\) are distinct, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `flag` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. All the other variables retain their initial states.
