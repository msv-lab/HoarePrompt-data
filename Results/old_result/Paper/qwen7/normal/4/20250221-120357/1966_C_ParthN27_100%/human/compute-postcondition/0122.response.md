Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` must be between 1 and n-1. If `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is now the opposite of its original value, and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1.
