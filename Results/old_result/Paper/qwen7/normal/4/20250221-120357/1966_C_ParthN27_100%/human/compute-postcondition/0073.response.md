Postcondition: `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is 1 (or any value between 1 and n-2), `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, `ans` is 1, `total` is 1, `n` is the length of list `s`, `n` is not equal to 2, and the current value of `s[i]` minus the current value of `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1.
