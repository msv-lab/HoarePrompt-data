Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers representing the number of stones in each pile. It then determines whether Alice or Bob wins based on the distribution of stones. Specifically, it checks if the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted unique list of stones is more than 1. If the number of such differences is even, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. The function prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' for each test case.**
