Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, the set `s` will contain all elements from the list `arr`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains the same list of integers, and `ans` reflects the final toggle state based on the sequence in `s`.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations (from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`), the set `s` will have all the elements from the list `arr` added to it. The variable `i` will have reached its maximum value of `n-1`, indicating that the loop has processed every element in the list exactly once. The variables `n`, `arr`, and `ans` remain as they were initially, with no changes made to them within the loop.
