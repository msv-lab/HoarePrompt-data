Output State: **`total` is 1, `i` is either -1 or `n-2`, `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning and length `n+1`, `ans` reflects the final toggle state based on the sequence in `s`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in the list `arr`. The initial values of `total`, `i`, `s`, `ans`, and `n` remain unchanged.
