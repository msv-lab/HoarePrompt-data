Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is 3, `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, `ans` is 1, `total` is 1, and `n` is the length of list `s` with `n` not equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `ans` and 1. Given that `ans` was initially either 0 or 1, the XOR operation will flip its value. If `ans` was 0, it becomes 1, and if `ans` was 1, it becomes 0. Since the initial value of `ans` is given as either 0 or 1, after the operation, `ans` will be the opposite value. Therefore, if `ans` was 0, it is now 1, and if `ans` was 1, it is now 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
