Output State: **Postcondition: `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is 1 (or any value between 1 and n-2), `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, `ans` is 1, `total` is 1, `n` is the length of list `s`, `n` is not equal to 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement that was being executed. None of the variables are modified by the `break` statement itself, so their previous values remain unchanged.
