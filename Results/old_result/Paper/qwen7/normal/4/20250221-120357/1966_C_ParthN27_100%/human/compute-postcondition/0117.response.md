Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged from its initial value.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is in the range `1` to `n-1` (exclusive).

4. **Check the initial value of `i` against the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be in the range `1` to `n-1`.
   - Given `i = n-1`, this means `n-1` must be in the range `1` to `n-1`. This is true if `n > 1`.

5. **Adjust the state accordingly**:
   - Since `n` is not equal to 2, `n` must be greater than 1 to satisfy the loop condition.
   - Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to be within the valid range of the loop, which means `i` should be between `1` and `n-1`.

6. **Final state adjustment**:
   - `n` remains unchanged and must be greater than 1.
   - `i` must be adjusted to be within the range `1` to `n-1`.

Given the above reasoning, the final state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` must be between 1 and n-1**
