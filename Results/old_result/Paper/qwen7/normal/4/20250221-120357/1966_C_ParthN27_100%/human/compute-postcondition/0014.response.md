Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-2`, `s` is a list containing `[0]` followed by all the elements from the list `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]` sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `s = [0] + s` prepends the value `0` to the list `s`. Since `s` originally contained all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]` sorted in ascending order, after the operation, `s` will start with `0` followed by these elements. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged except that `i` is now `n-2` because `i` was previously `n-1`.
