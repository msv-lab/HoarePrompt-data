Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is equal to the length of `s`.
- `i` is equal to `n-1`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `arr` remains the same list of integers.
- `s` is `[0] + s`.
- `ans` is 1.
- Additionally, `n` is equal to 2.

Given this information, let's break down the print statement:

1. The print statement is `print('Alice')`.
2. There are no variables or objects being referenced within the print statement itself; it simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **Alice**
