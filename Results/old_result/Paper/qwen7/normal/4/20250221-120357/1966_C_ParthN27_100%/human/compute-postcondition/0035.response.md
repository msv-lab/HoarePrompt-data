Output State: **`total` is 1, `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a list containing [0] followed by all the elements from the list `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]` sorted in ascending order, and `ans` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `total`, `i`, `n`, `s`, or `ans`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are currently inside. Since no other operations are performed, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and we simply note that we break out of the loop or conditional block.
