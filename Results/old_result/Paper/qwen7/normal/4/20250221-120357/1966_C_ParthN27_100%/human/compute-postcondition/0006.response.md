Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `arr[i]` is added to the set `s`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to the previous value of `i` plus 1.
   - `n` must remain the same as it was at the start of the current iteration because the loop condition depends on `n` and not on `i` alone.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` remains unchanged and still needs to be greater than 0.
   - `arr[i]` will be added to the set `s` in the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `arr[i]` will be added to the set `s`.

Since we don't know the exact previous value of `i`, we can represent it as `i + 1` (where `i` was the value at the end of the previous iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `n` must be greater than 0; `arr[i + 1]` is added to the set `s`.**
