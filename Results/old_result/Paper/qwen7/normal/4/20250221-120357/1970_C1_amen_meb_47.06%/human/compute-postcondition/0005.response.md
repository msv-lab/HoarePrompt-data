Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element; `numbers` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `nums` is assigned the value of `numbers`, and the length of `nums` is not equal to 2. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `numbers`, or `nums`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
