Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game played on a tree structure with specific rules. The game is played for one round, and the winner is determined based on the optimal moves made by Ron and Hermione.

2. **Function `func_1()` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` is supposed to read input pairs of integers representing edges of the tree until the input no longer consists of exactly two elements.
   - However, the function does not actually use any of the input pairs to construct the tree or determine the winner. Instead, it simply returns the list of input pairs without processing them further.

3. **Main Program Analysis**:
   - The main program calls `func_1()`, but since `func_1()` does not process the input to determine the winner, the main program logic is flawed.
   - The main program attempts to count certain conditions (`num_1 > num_2` and `num_1 == num_2`) from the returned list, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.
   - The main program does not use the actual structure of the tree or the optimal moves to determine the winner. It seems to be trying to compare some values that do not correspond to the game logic.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner of the game. The function `func_1()` does not contribute to solving the problem, and the main program logic is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
