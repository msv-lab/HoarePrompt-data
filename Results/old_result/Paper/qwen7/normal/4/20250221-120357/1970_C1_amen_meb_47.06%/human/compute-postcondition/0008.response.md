Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `num1` is the first element of the list `nums`, `num2` is the second element of the list `nums`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if the length of `nums` is not equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code assigns the second element of the list `nums` to the variable `num2`. Since `num1` was already defined as the first element of the list `nums`, and the condition to break out of the loop or if statement is based on the length of `nums` being 2, which remains unchanged, the other variables retain their initial conditions.
