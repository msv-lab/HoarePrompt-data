### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1()` is not correctly implemented for the given problem. The function is supposed to read pairs of integers representing edges of the tree, but instead, it reads pairs from standard input, which is not mentioned in the problem description. Additionally, the main program logic does not align with the game rules described in the problem.

However, let's re-examine the problem and the provided code more closely:

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function is supposed to read pairs of integers representing edges of the tree. Given the problem description, the input should be provided in the form of `n-1` lines, each containing two integers representing an edge.
   - The function `func_1()` should not use `input()` but should instead take the input as a list of edges provided in the problem statement.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program logic iterates over the result of `func_1()` and counts the number of times `num_1` is greater than `num_2`. This logic is irrelevant to the game rules but is not necessarily incorrect if the function `func_1()` were correctly implemented.
   - The game logic involves determining the winner based on the parity of the number of moves. Since the tree has exactly two leaves, the game can be analyzed based on the structure of the tree and the starting node.

Given the problem description and the intended solution, the function `func_1()` should be corrected to read the input as specified. However, the main program logic, assuming the function `func_1()` is correctly implemented, does not inherently violate the game rules. The logic simply counts the number of times `num_1` is greater than `num_2`, which could be a way to determine the winner based on some interpretation of the game.

Since the function `func_1()` is not correctly implemented, the overall program is incorrect. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the misimplementation of the function `func_1()`.
