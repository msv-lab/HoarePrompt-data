Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `num1` is the integer value of the first element of the list `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element of the list `nums`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `num2 = int(nums[1])` assigns the integer value of the second element of the list `nums` to the variable `num2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state did not specify the exact value of `num1`, it remains as the integer value of the first element of the list `nums`. The conditions regarding `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement remain valid.
