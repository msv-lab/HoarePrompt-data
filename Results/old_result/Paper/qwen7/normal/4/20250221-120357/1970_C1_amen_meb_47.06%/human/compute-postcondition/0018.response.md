Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `num1` is the integer value of the first element of the list `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element of the list `nums`, and the list `numbers` contains one element which is `[num1, num2]; nums` is a list obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `nums = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `nums`. The values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `num1`, `num2`, and `numbers` remain unchanged from their initial states, but now `nums` holds the list obtained from the input.
