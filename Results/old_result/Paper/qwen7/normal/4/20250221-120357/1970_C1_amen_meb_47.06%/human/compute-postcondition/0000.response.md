Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element; `numbers` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `numbers`. All other variables (`n`, `t`, `u`, `v`) retain their initial conditions.
