Output State: The loop will terminate when the input no longer consists of exactly two elements. After all iterations, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `num1` and `num2` will hold the last pair of integers provided as input, and `numbers` is a list containing all pairs of integers `[num1, num2]` provided as input until the loop terminates.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `n` remains within its initial range, `t` stays as 1, `u` and `v` stay within their initial range, `num1` and `num2` will be the last two numbers entered, and `numbers` will contain every pair of numbers entered during the loop's execution.
