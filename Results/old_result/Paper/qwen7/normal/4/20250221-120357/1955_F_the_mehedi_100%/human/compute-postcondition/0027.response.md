Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop is defined as `for x in a:`. The only variable in the loop head is `x`.

2. **Understand the relationship between variables**: At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the last element of `a`, and `a` is a non-empty list.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be the next element in the list `a`. Since `x` is the last element of `a` at the end of the previous iteration, the next element in the list (if it exists) would be the first element of `a`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: 
   - `a` remains a non-empty list.
   - `x` becomes the first element of `a`.
   - `cnt` and `t` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Given these points, the updated states are:
- `a` is a non-empty list.
- `x` is the first element of `a`.
- `cnt` is still 5.
- `t` is still a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `x` is the first element of `a`, `cnt` is 5, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
