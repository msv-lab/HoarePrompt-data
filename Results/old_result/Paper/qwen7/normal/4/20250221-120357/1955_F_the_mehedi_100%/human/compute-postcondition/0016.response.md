Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
- `x` is the last element of `a`.
- `cnt` is the sum of 4 (from the first iteration) plus the floor division of each subsequent element of `a` by 2.
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

The value of `cnt` is calculated as follows:
- Start with 4 (from the first iteration).
- For each subsequent element in `a`, add the floor division of that element by 2 to `cnt`.

Let's break it down:

1. Initialize `cnt` to 4.
2. For each element in `a` (starting from the second element), perform the floor division by 2 and add it to `cnt`.

So, if `a = [a1, a2, ..., an]`, then:
\[ cnt = 4 + \left\lfloor \frac{a2}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{a3}{2} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{an}{2} \right\rfloor \]

The `print(cnt)` statement will output the computed value of `cnt`.

Output: **4 + floor(a2/2) + floor(a3/2) + ... + floor(an/2)**
