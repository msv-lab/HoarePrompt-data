Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not used in the code. The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. Since the exact input is not specified, `a` is described as a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
