Output State: **`x` is the third element of `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `cnt` is 4 plus the floor division of `x` by 2, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**

Explanation: The initial value of `cnt` is 3 plus the floor division of `x` by 2. After executing `cnt += math.floor(x / 2)`, `cnt` is incremented by the floor division of `x` by 2. Therefore, the new value of `cnt` is 4 plus the floor division of `x` by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
