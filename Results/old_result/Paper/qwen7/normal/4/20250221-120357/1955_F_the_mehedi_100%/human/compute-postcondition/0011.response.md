Output State: **`x` is the second element of `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `cnt` is 3 plus the floor division of `x` by 2, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is incremented by the floor division of `x` by 2. Since `x` is the second element of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, the value of `cnt` is updated to `3 + (x // 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
