The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the floor division of each count by 2 and prints the result. After processing all test cases, it outputs the total count for each test case.
