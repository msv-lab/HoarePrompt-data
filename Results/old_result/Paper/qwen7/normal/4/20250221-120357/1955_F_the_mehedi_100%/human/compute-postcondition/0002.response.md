Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

The code initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. No other changes are made to the variables `t` or `a`. Therefore, the value of `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range, and `a` remains a list of integers obtained from the input.
