Output State: **`a` is updated to a list of integers from the input, `x` is the second-to-last element of `a`, `cnt` is the sum of 4 plus the floor division of each element of `a` by 2 up to the second-to-last processed element, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The variable `x` remains unchanged as it was defined before this code snippet. The variable `cnt` is not directly affected by this code snippet, and `t` remains unchanged as well.
