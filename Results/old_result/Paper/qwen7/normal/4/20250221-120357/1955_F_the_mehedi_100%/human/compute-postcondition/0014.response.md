Output State: `x` is the last element of `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `cnt` is the sum of 4 (from the first iteration) plus the floor division of each subsequent element of `a` by 2, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `x` will be the last element processed from the list `a`. The variable `cnt` will be incremented by the floor division of each element in `a` by 2, starting from 4 (since it was 3 after the first iteration and then incremented by 1 for the second and third iterations). The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
