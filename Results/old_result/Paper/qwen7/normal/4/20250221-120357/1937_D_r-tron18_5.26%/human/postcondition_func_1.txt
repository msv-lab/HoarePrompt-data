The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and an integer `n`. It calculates and returns a list `ans` where each element represents the balance of '<' and '>' characters up to that position in the string `s1`. The balance is determined based on the number of '>' characters encountered so far and the number of '<' characters from the end of the string up to that position. The function updates the list `ans` by iterating through the string `s1` from the end to the beginning and performing the necessary calculations. After completing the iteration, the function prints the elements of the list `ans`.
