Postcondition: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`. If `el` equals `'>'`, then `totalOne` is decreased by 1, `ol` remains unchanged, `zr` remains unchanged, `zeroInd` is recalculated as `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is recalculated using `func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1) + func_1(preOne, len(suffZero)) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `fi` is recalculated as `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`. If `el` does not equal `'>'`, then `suffZero` is updated to `[suffZero[-1] + i + 1]`, `ol` remains unchanged, `zr` is recalculated as `len(suffZero) - 1`, and `ans[i]` is calculated based on whether `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`. If `zr <= ol`, then `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. Otherwise, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, which is greater than `ol`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.**
