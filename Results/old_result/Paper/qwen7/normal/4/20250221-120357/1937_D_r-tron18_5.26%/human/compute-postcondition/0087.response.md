Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`; `suffZero` is updated by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` to it, `ol` is now `totalOne`, `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`**.

Explanation:
- The value of `ans[i]` is updated from `el - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr <= ol` or `el - oneInd` if `zr > ol` to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. This is because the condition `zr <= ol` or `zr > ol` does not affect the assignment since the new value of `ans[i]` is directly assigned without checking the condition.
- `suffZero` is appended with `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, which updates the list `suffZero`.
- `ol` is now `totalOne`, and `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`, reflecting the changes in the length of `suffZero`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
