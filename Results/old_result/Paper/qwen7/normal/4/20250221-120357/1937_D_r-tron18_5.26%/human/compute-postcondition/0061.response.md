Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `suffZero` is `[suffZero[-1] + i + 1, suffZero[-1] + i + 1 + suffZero[-2]]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates `ans[i]` with the value of `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. Since the exact values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd` depend on the functions and variables involved, they remain as expressions. All other variables retain their previous states.
