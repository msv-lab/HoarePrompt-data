Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `oneInd - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `ans[i]` is `el - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr <= ol` or `el - oneInd` if `zr > ol`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `fi` which is the difference between the results of the function `func_1` evaluated at `zr + 1` and `zr`. This value is assigned to `fi`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
