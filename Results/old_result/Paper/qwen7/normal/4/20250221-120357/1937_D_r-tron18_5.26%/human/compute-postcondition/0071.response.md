Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`, `oneInd` is unchanged, and `ans[i]` is unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code updates `zeroInd` to `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`. Given that `ol` is `totalOne`, `zeroInd` is now `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`.
- The values of `i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `oneInd`, and `ans[i]` remain unchanged because no operations affecting these variables are performed.
