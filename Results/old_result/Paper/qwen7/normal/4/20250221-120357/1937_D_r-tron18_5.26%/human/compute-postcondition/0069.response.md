Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is either `2 * func_1(suffZero, zr + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` or `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` depending on the condition `zr <= ol`, `oneInd` is either `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` or `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` depending on the condition `zr <= ol`, and `ans[i]` is `el - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr <= ol` or `el - oneInd` if `zr > ol`.**

Explanation: The code updates `el` to be equal to `s1[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `i` is `n-4`, `el` is now `s1[n-4]`. The expressions for `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `ans[i]` remain as they were, but now `el` is updated to `s1[i]`.
