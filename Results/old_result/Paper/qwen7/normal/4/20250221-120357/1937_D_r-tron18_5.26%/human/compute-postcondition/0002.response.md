Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each element is the index (i + 1) of each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with 0.**

Explanation: The code `preOne = list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))` creates a new list `preOne` where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from 0. This means that `preOne[i]` is the sum of all elements in `pre` from index 0 to i-1 (if i > 0) or just 0 (if i = 0). The initial state variables (`totalOne`, `s1`, and `pre`) remain unchanged in terms of their types and values, but the new variable `preOne` is introduced with the calculated cumulative sums.
