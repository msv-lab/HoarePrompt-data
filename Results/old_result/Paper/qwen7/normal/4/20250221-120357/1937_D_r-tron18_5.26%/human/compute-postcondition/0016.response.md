Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `'> '`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`**.

The code assigns the value of `2 * suffZero[-1]` to the variable `zeroInd`. Since `suffZero` is a list, `suffZero[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `suffZero`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
