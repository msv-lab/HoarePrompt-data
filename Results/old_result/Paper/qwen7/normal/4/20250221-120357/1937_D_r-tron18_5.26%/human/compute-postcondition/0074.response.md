Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is either `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` or `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` depending on the condition `zr <= ol`, and `ans[i]` is `el - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr <= ol` or `el - oneInd` if `zr > ol`. `ol` is updated to `totalOne` and `zr` is updated to `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `zeroInd` to `2 * suffZero[-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `zeroInd` and retains the initial states of the other variables.
