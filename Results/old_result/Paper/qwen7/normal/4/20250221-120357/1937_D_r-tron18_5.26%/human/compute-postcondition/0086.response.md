Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, `ans[i]` is `el - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr <= ol` or `el - oneInd` if `zr > ol`; `suffZero` is updated by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` to it, `ol` is now `totalOne`, `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `oneInd` to `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous values. The updated value of `oneInd` depends on the function `func_1` applied to `preOne` and `zr`. The value of `suffZero` is appended with `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, and `ol` and `zr` are updated accordingly.
