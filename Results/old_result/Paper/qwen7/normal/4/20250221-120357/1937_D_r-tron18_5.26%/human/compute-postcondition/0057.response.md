Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `suffZero` is `[suffZero[-1] + i + 1]`**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `suffZero`. The new element is calculated as `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`. Since `suffZero` was initially empty, `suffZero[-1]` is considered as 0 (as per Python's list indexing rules). Therefore, the new element becomes `0 + (n-3) + 1 = n-2`. The values of `i` and `el` remain unchanged.
