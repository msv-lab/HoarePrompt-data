Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is either `2 * func_1(suffZero, zr + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` or `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` depending on the condition `zr <= ol`, `oneInd` is either `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` or `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` depending on the condition `zr <= ol`, and `ans[i]` is `el - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr <= ol` or `el - oneInd` if `zr > ol`; `suffZero` is updated by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` to it.**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `suffZero`. The new value is calculated as `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
