Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `totalOne` to `ol` and the value of `len(suffZero) - 1` to `zr`. The variables `i`, `el`, and `s1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
