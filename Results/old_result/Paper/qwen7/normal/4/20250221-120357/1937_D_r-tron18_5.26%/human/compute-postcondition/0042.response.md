Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-2`
   - `el` is `s1[n-2]`

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i >= 0`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-2`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `n-3`.

5. **Determine the new value of `el`**:
   - `el` is `s1[n-3]` because `i` is now `n-3`.

6. **Identify which other states might change based on the condition**:
   - If `el` equals `'>'`, then:
     - `totalOne` is decreased by 1
     - `zeroInd` is recalculated as `2 * suffZero[-1]`
     - `oneInd` is recalculated using `func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1) + func_1(preOne, len(suffZero)) - func_1(preOne, 1)`
     - `fi` is recalculated as `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`
   - If `el` does not equal `'>'`, then:
     - `suffZero` is updated to `[suffZero[-1] + i + 1]`
     - `zr` is recalculated as `len(suffZero) - 1`
     - `ans[i]` is calculated based on whether `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`

7. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since we are only asked to adjust the states at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the new value of `i` and the potential changes in `el`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`**
