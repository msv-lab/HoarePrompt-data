Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`, `suffZero` is updated by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` to it, `ol` is now `totalOne`, `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`**

Explanation: The code updates `ans[i]` to be `zeroInd - oneInd`. The values of `i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `suffZero`, and `totalOne` remain unchanged from their previous values. Additionally, `suffZero` is updated by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` to itself, and `ol` and `zr` are updated to reflect the new length of `suffZero`.
