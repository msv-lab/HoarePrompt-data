Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, `el` is not `'>'; suffZero` is `[suffZero[-1] + i + 1]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `totalOne` to `ol` and the value of `len(suffZero) - 1` to `zr`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the values of `i`, `el`, and `suffZero` remain unchanged from their initial states.
