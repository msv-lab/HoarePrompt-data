Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each element is the index (i + 1) of each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with 0, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    el = s1[i]
    if el == '>':
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if ol <= zr:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
            oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
            oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
            fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
        preOne.pop()
        totalOne -= 1
    else:
        suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if zr <= ol:
            zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
            oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`. If `el` equals `'>'`, then `totalOne` is decreased by 1, `ol` remains unchanged, `zr` remains unchanged, `zeroInd` is recalculated as `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is recalculated using `func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1) + func_1(preOne, len(suffZero)) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `fi` is recalculated as `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`. If `el` does not equal `'>'`, then `suffZero` is updated to `[suffZero[-1] + i + 1]`, `ol` remains unchanged, `zr` is recalculated as `len(suffZero) - 1`, and `ans[i]` is calculated based on whether `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`. If `zr <= ol`, then `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. Otherwise, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, which is greater than `ol`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is either `2 * func_1(suffZero, zr + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` or `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` depending on the condition `zr <= ol`, `oneInd` is either `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` or `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` depending on the condition `zr <= ol`, and `ans[i]` is either `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` or `zeroInd - oneInd` depending on the condition `zr <= ol`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n-4`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. Depending on the condition `zr <= ol`, `zeroInd` is either `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` or `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is either `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` or `oneInd - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `totalOne` is either `totalOne - 1` or `totalOne`, and `preOne` is either updated by removing its last element or unchanged. `ans[i]` is either `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` or `zeroInd - oneInd`. `suffZero` is either updated by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` to it or unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
