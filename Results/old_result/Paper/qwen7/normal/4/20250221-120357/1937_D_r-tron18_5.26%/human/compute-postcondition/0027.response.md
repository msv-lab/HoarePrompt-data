Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, and `el` is not `'>'; suffZero` is `[suffZero[-1] + i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `suffZero`. The new value is calculated as `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`. Here, `suffZero[-1]` refers to the last element in the list `suffZero`, `i` is `n-2`, and `1` is just the number one. Since `suffZero` was initially empty, `suffZero[-1]` does not exist before the first append operation. After appending, `suffZero` contains the value `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, which is `0 + (n-2) + 1 = n-1`. The values of `i`, `el`, and `s1` remain unchanged.
