Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, `el` is not `'>'; `suffZero` is `[suffZero[-1] + i + 1]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` to the variable `oneInd`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `preOne` and `zr` are already defined, so `oneInd` is calculated as twice the result of `func_1(preOne, zr)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
