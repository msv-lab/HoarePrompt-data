Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `suffZero` is `[suffZero[-1] + i + 1]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `2 * preOne[-1]` to the variable `oneInd`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `el`, `suffZero`, `ol`, `zr`, and `zeroInd` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `oneInd` is calculated based on the value of `preOne[-1]`.
