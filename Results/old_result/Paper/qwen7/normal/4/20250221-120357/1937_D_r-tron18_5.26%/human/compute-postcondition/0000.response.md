Output State: **`s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each element is the index (i + 1) of each occurrence of '>' in `s1`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list comprehension that iterates over the enumerated elements of `s1`. For each element where the character is '>', it calculates the index (using `enumerate`) plus one and adds it to the list `pre`. The length of `s1` remains unchanged, and the original string `s1` is still a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
