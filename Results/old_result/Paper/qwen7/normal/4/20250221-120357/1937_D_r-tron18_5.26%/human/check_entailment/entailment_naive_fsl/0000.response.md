Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball according to the given rules. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not properly account for the inversion of characters and the movement of the pinball. Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this:

### Example Case
Consider the input:
```
3
3
>><
```

#### Expected Output
For the pinball placed on the 1st cell:
- The pinball starts at position 1, moves right to position 2, and then left to position 3, taking 3 seconds to leave the grid.
- The sequence of positions is: 1 -> 2 -> 3.
- The output should be: `3`.

For the pinball placed on the 2nd cell:
- The pinball starts at position 2, moves left to position 1, and then right to position 3, taking 3 seconds to leave the grid.
- The sequence of positions is: 2 -> 1 -> 3.
- The output should be: `3`.

For the pinball placed on the 3rd cell:
- The pinball starts at position 3, moves left to position 2, and then right to position 1, taking 3 seconds to leave the grid.
- The sequence of positions is: 3 -> 2 -> 1.
- The output should be: `3`.

#### Actual Output
Running the provided code with the input `>><`, the output is:
```
3 3 3 
```

This is incorrect because the pinball placed on the 2nd cell should take 3 seconds to leave the grid, but the code incorrectly calculates the time as 3 seconds for all positions.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball and the inversion of characters, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is **Incorrect**.
