Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is either `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` or `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` depending on the condition `zr <= ol`, `ans[i]` is `el - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr <= ol` or `el - oneInd` if `zr > ol`; `suffZero` is updated by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` to it, `ol` is now `totalOne`, `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The line `zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` updates the value of `zeroInd` to be the sum of the last two elements of `suffZero`.
- All other variables (`i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `oneInd`, `ans[i]`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
- The length of `suffZero` increases by 1, and `ol` is now set to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is now updated to be the new length of `suffZero` minus 1.
