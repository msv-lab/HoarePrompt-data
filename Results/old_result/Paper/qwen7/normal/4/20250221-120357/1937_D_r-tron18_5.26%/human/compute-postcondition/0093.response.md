Postcondition: `i` is `n-4`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. Depending on the condition `zr <= ol`, `zeroInd` is either `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)` or `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is either `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` or `oneInd - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `totalOne` is either `totalOne - 1` or `totalOne`, `preOne` is either unchanged or updated by removing its last element, `ans[i]` is either `el - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr <= ol` or `el - oneInd` if `zr > ol`, `suffZero` is either unchanged or updated by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` to it, and `ol` is either `totalOne` or unchanged.
