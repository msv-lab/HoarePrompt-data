Output State: **`i` is `n-2`; `el` is `s1[n-2]`**

Explanation: The code `el = s1[i]` assigns the value of `s1[i]` to the variable `el`. Given the initial state where `i` is `n-1`, after executing the code, `i` is decremented by 1 (since list indices are zero-based), making `i` equal to `n-2`. The value of `el` is now set to the element at index `n-2` in the list `s1`.
