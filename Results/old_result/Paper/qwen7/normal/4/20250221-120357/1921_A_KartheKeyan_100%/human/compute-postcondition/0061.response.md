Output State: `i` is 0, `n` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[('input integer', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer')], `p2` is (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]), `res` is math.sqrt(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` will be reduced to 0 because it starts as an input integer and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `i` in the inner loop will also be 0 after the last iteration since it ranges from 0 to 3 and increments with each iteration of the outer loop. The state of `x` and `y` remains unchanged as they are inputs provided during each iteration. The `coord` list contains the coordinates entered in the last iteration, and `p2` and `res` are calculated based on these coordinates.
