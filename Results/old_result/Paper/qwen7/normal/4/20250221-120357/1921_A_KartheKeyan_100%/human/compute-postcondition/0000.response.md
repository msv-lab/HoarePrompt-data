Output State: **`n` is an integer less than the original value, `s` is the sum of `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2` for each `l` entered, and `l` is an integer entered in the loop.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` which represents the number of iterations. In each iteration, it reads an integer `l`, calculates `s` as `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`, and prints `s`. After each iteration, `n` is decremented by 1. Once `n` becomes 0, the loop terminates. The values of `n` and `s` are updated based on the input values, and `l` retains its last value from the loop.
