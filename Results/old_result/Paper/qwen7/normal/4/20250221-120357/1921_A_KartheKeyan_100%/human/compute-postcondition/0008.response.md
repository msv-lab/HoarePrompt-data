Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(4)`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the current state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs. Since the loop starts with `i` being 0, after each iteration, `i` increases by 1.

3. **Calculate the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration**: If the loop has just completed its previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented from its previous value. Given that the loop iterates from 0 to 3, the possible values of `i` at the start of each iteration are 0, 1, 2, and 3.

4. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than 4.

5. **Adjust the state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. So, if the loop just finished its third iteration (`i` was 3), it will now be 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 0, 1, 2, or 3. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the next iteration to occur, `i` must be 3 (since the next increment will bring it to 4, ending the loop).

6. **Adjust the other variables**: The other variables mentioned in the state (such as `coord`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted based on the loop itself.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`coord` is a list containing a tuple (x, y), where x and y are integers from the input split, `i` is 3**
