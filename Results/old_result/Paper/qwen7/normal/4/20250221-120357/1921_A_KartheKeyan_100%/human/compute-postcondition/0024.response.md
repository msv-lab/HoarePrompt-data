Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(4)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is initially 4.

3. **Determine the Range of the For Loop**: The `range(4)` function generates numbers from 0 to 3 (inclusive). Therefore, `i` will take values 0, 1, 2, and 3 during the loop execution.

4. **Adjust the State of `i`**: Since `i` starts at 4 and the loop will run for values 0 through 3, `i` must be adjusted to start from 0 to ensure the loop runs as expected.

5. **Determine the State of `n`**: The loop condition `range(n)` implies that `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to run 4 times. Given that `n` must be non-zero, we need to ensure `n` is at least 4.

6. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`coord`, `p2`, `res`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop execution directly. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above steps, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 4**
