Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(4):`. The only variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 4.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 4
   - `x` is an input integer
   - `y` is an input integer
   - `coord` is a list containing two tuples: (1, input integer) and (input integer, input integer)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `coord` do not change within the loop head and are not affected by the loop itself.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 4, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing two tuples: (1, input integer) and (input integer, input integer)**
