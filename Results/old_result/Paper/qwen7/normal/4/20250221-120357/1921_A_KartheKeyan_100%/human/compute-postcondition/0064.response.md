Functionality: **The function processes up to 100 sets of coordinates, each representing the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. For each set, it calculates the side lengths of the square and then computes the product of these side lengths to determine the area. Finally, it prints the rounded area for each square.**
