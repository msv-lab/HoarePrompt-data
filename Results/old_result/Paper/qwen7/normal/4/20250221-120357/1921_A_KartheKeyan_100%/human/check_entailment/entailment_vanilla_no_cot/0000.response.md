Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Sorting the Coordinates**: The current approach of sorting the coordinates does not guarantee that the pairs of points forming the sides of the square will be correctly identified. Sorting might not place the points in a way that allows for easy calculation of side lengths.

2. **Calculation of Side Lengths**: The program calculates the distances between specific pairs of points and then multiplies these distances to get the area. This is incorrect because the distances calculated may not represent the actual side lengths of the square. For example, the distance between two diagonally opposite points would be the diagonal length, not the side length.

3. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic used to calculate `p1` and `p2` assumes that the points are already in a specific order, which they are not after sorting. This makes the calculation unreliable.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly identify the side length of the square, we need to:
- Calculate all pairwise distances between the points.
- Identify the smallest distance, which should be the side length of the square.
- Square this distance to get the area.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        min_distance_squared = float('inf')
        for i in range(4):
            for j in range(i+1, 4):
                dist_squared = (coord[i][0] - coord[j][0])**2 + (coord[i][1] - coord[j][1])**2
                if dist_squared < min_distance_squared:
                    min_distance_squared = dist_squared
        
        area = math.sqrt(min_distance_squared)
        print(round(area**2))
        n -= 1

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the smallest distance between any two points (which should be the side length of the square) is found and then squared to compute the area.
