Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes t sets of coordinates (x_i, y_i) where each set represents the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. For each set, it returns whether the squares overlap or not.**

Note: The actual logic to determine if the squares overlap would involve comparing the coordinates of the squares, but since we are only describing the functionality, we do not detail the comparison process here.
