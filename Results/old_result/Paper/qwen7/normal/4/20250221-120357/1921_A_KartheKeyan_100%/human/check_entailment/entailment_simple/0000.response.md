Reasoning:

The provided program aims to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and the correctness of the implementation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Coordinate Collection**: For each test case, it collects four coordinates and stores them in a list named `coord`.
3. **Sorting Coordinates**: The coordinates are sorted, which helps in identifying adjacent points more easily.
4. **Distance Calculation**: It calculates the squared distance between the first and second points (`p1`) and between the third and fourth points (`p2`). Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, these distances should theoretically be equal and represent the side length squared of the square.
5. **Area Calculation**: The area is calculated as the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, which simplifies to just the square root of `p1` (or `p2`, since they are equal).
6. **Output**: The area is printed after rounding.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the square (with sides parallel to the axes), the approach taken by the program is logically sound and should work correctly for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
