Output State: **`i` is 8, `n` is at least 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[('input integer', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer')], `p2` is (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]), `res` is math.sqrt(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])**.

Explanation: The code calculates `p2` as the difference between the first elements of the last two tuples in the `coord` list. However, the code then tries to multiply `math.sqrt(p1)` with `math.sqrt(p2)`. Since `p1` is not defined anywhere in the provided code, it is treated as a reference to an undefined variable. As a result, only `p2` is calculated and stored in `res`. The other variables remain unchanged.
