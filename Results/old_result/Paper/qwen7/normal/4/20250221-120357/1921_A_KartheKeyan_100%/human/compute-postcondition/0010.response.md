Output State: **`coord` is now a list containing two tuples: the first one is (x, y) from the input split, and the second one is also (x, y); `i` is 3**.

This means that the list `coord` originally contained one tuple `(x, y)`, and after executing `coord.append((x, y))`, it now contains two identical tuples `(x, y)`. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 3.
