Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 4, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing two tuples: (1, input integer) and (input integer, input integer)**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Initially, `coord` contains one tuple `(input integer, input integer)`. After executing the code, `coord` now contains two tuples: the original tuple and the new tuple `(x, y)`. The values of `i`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
