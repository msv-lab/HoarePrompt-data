Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` in the range function `for i in range(4):`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `coord` is a list containing two tuples: the first one is `(x, y)` from the input split, and the second one is also `(x, y)`.
   - `i` is 3.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 4. Since `i` is currently 3, it will increment to 4 in the next iteration, and the loop will terminate because `i` will no longer satisfy the condition `i < 4`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented from 3 to 4. However, since the loop will terminate after this iteration, no other state needs to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to 4.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`coord` is now a list containing two tuples: the first one is (x, y) from the input split, and the second one is also (x, y); `i` is 4**
