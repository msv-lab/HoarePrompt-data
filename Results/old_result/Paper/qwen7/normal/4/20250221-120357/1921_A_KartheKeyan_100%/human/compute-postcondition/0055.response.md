Output State: **`i` is 8, `n` is at least 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[('input integer', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer')], `p2` is `x - coord[2][0]`, `res` is 0, `coord` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple.**

Explanation: The `sorted()` function sorts the `coord` list based on the first element of each tuple. Since the initial `coord` list contains four tuples of the form `('input integer', 'input integer')`, after sorting, the `coord` list will be ordered by the first elements of these tuples in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged.
