Output State: **`i` is 4, `coord` is an empty list, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and second tuple in `coord`, `res` is 0, and `n` must be non-zero.**

Explanation: The line `res = 0` sets the variable `res` to 0. This overwrites the previous value of `res`, which was the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`. All other variables (`i`, `coord`, `p2`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
