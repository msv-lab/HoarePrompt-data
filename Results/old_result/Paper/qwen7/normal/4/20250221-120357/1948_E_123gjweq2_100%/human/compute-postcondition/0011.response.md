Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(mid)` statement. The only variables involved in this loop are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - `mid` is a positive integer (though its exact value is not specified).
   - `cliquess[left + 1]` is `clique`.
   - `arr[left + mid - 2]` is `small_element + 1`.
   - `arr[left + mid - 3]` is `small_element + 1`.
   - `cliquess[left + 3]` is `clique`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < mid`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i = 4`.
   - The value of `mid` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `i` is now 4.
   - `mid` remains a positive integer (unchanged from the previous iteration).
   - The other variables (`cliquess[left + 1]`, `cliquess[left + 3]`, `arr[left + mid - 2]`, `arr[left + mid - 3]`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 4, `mid` is a positive integer, `cliquess[left + 1]` is `clique`, `arr[left + mid - 2]` is `small_element + 1`, `arr[left + mid - 3]` is `small_element + 1, `cliquess[left + 3]` is `clique**.
