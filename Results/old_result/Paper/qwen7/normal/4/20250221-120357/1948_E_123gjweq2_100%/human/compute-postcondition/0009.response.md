Output State: **`i` is 2, `mid` is a positive integer, `cliquess[left + 1]` is `clique`, `arr[left + mid - 2]` is `small_element + 1`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `small_element + 1**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` to `small_element + i`. Given that `i` was initially 1 and is now incremented to 2, the updated index in the array `arr` is `left + mid - 2`, and its value is set to `small_element + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
