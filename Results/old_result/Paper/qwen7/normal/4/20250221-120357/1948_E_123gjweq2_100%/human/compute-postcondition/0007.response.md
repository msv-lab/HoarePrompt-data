Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(mid)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Determine the Current State After the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `mid` is a positive integer.
   - `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`.
   - `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `small_element + i`.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < mid`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `mid`.

4. **Update the States**:
   - Since the loop just finished its first iteration with `i = 0`, the next iteration will increment `i` by 1, making `i = 1`.
   - `mid` remains unchanged as it is a constant value for the duration of the loop.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `cliquess[left + i]` will now be `cliquess[left + 1]`.
   - `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` will now be `arr[left + mid - 2]`.

Given these adjustments, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is 1, `mid` is a positive integer, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `small_element + 1`**
