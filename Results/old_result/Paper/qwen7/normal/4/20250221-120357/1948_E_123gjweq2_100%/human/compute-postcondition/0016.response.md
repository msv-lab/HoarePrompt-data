To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the following variables: `i` and `not_mid`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i < not_mid`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - From the given output state, we know that after the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `mid`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the loop, `i` should be set to 0 (the default starting value for `range`).

4. **Determine the Value of `not_mid`:**
   - Since the loop will run until `i` equals `mid`, `not_mid` must be greater than or equal to `mid` for the loop to execute properly.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - The variables `cliquess`, `arr`, `left`, `clique`, `small_element` are not part of the loop head and their values do not directly affect the loop execution. They remain in their initial or unchanged states.

Given these points, the only variables that need adjustment are `i` and `not_mid`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0, `not_mid` must be greater than or equal to `mid`**
