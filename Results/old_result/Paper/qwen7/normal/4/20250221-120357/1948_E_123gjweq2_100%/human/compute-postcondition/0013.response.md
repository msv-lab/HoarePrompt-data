Output State: **`i` is 4, `mid` is a positive integer, `cliquess[left + 1]` is `clique`, `arr[left + mid - 2]` is `small_element + 1`, `arr[left + mid - 3]` is `small_element + 1`, `cliquess[left + 3]` is `clique`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, `arr[left + mid - 5]` is `small_element + 4**.

Explanation: The code `cliquess[left + i] = clique` updates the value of `cliquess[left + i]` to `clique`. Given that `i` is initially 4, `cliquess[left + i]` becomes `cliquess[left + 4]` and is assigned the value of `clique`. All other variables remain unchanged.
