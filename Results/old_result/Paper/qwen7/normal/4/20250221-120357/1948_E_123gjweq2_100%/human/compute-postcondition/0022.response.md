Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in range(not_mid)`. The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `not_mid`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   The loop will execute as long as `i < not_mid`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `not_mid` must be greater than or equal to `mid`
   - `cliquess[left + mid + 1]` is equal to `clique`
   - `arr[left + mid + 1]` is set to `big_element - 1`
   - `arr[left + mid + 2]` is `big_element - 2`
   - `cliquess[left + mid + 3]` is equal to `clique`

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - The condition `i < not_mid` must still hold true, so `not_mid` must remain greater than or equal to 4.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `not_mid`.

**Final State:**
- `i` is 4
- `not_mid` must be greater than or equal to 4

State: **`i` is 4, `not_mid` must be greater than or equal to 4**
