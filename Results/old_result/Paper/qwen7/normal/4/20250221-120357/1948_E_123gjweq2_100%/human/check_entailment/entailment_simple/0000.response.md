Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to assign distinct integers to vertices of a graph such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code defines a function `func_1` that takes `n` and `k` as parameters and prints the required output.
   - The `cliques` variable is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`, which gives the minimum number of cliques needed.
   - The `arr` and `cliquess` arrays are initialized to all zeros.
   - The `make_array` function fills these arrays based on the specified range and clique index.
   - The `make_array` function correctly assigns values to the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays in a way that ensures the conditions for forming cliques are met.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The `cliques` calculation ensures that the graph is partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques.
   - The `make_array` function correctly assigns values to ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
   - The output format matches the requirements of the problem.

4. **Verification**:
   - For the given example cases, the code produces the correct output:
     - For `n=2` and `k=3`, the output is `2 1\n1\n1 1`, which is correct.
     - For `n=5` and `k=4`, the output is `3 1 5 2 4\n2\n1 1 2 1 2`, which is correct.
     - For `n=8` and `k=16`, the output is `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`, which is correct.

Based on the above analysis, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
