Output State: **`i` is 0, `not_mid` must be greater than or equal to `mid`, and `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is equal to `clique`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + mid + i]`. Since `i` is initially 0, the index `left + mid + i` simplifies to `left + mid`. The value of `arr[left + mid + i]` is given as `big_element - i`, which remains unchanged. The conditions involving `not_mid` and `mid` remain valid as no changes were made to these variables.
