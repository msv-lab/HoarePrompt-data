Output State: **`left` is an integer such that 0 <= left < right < n; `right` is an integer such that 0 <= left < right < n; `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier; `small_element` is left + 1; `big_element` is right + 1; `mid` is ((right + 1) - (left + 1) + 1) // 2.**

This means that `mid` is calculated as half the difference between `big_element` and `small_element`, plus one, divided by 2, using integer division. The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, and `big_element` remain unchanged from their initial states.
