You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

- Annotated Code:

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    print(func_1(n, s1, s2))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1', where '1' indicates the presence of a cat in the corresponding box in the initial and final states, respectively.
def func_1(n, s1, s2):
    counter = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and s1[i] != s1[i + 1]:
                counter += 1
                i += 2

    #State: Output State: The final value of `counter` will be the sum of all increments made during the loop's execution. The variable `i` will be set to `n` after the loop completes, indicating that the loop has finished iterating over all elements of the strings `s1` and `s2`.
    #
    #In more detail, `counter` will be incremented each time there is a mismatch between `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` under specific conditions. These conditions are:
    #- `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`
    #- If `i < n - 1`, `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`
    #
    #If these conditions are met, `counter` is incremented by 1 and `i` skips two positions (`i += 2`). Otherwise, `counter` is incremented by 1 and `i` moves to the next position (`i += 1`).
    #
    #After the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `counter` will hold the total number of valid mismatches found in the strings `s1` and `s2` according to the given conditions.
    return counter
    #The program returns the total number of valid mismatches found in the strings `s1` and `s2` according to the given conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: a positive integer `n`, and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. It counts and returns the total number of positions where the characters in `s1` and `s2` differ, following specific conditions. If `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` are different, and either `i` is not the last index or the characters at `i+1` in both strings are also different and not equal to `s1[i]`, then it counts this as a valid mismatch. Otherwise, it counts it as a mismatch without the additional condition. After checking all positions, it returns the total count of valid mismatches.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s1` into the desired state `s2`. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed and does not account for all possible scenarios.

Consider the following test case:
```
n = 4
s1 = "0101"
s2 = "1010"
```

Expected output: `2` (Move the cat from the 1st box to the 2nd box, and then from the 3rd box to the 4th box).

However, the program will output `1` because it incorrectly assumes that moving a cat from one box to another and then moving another cat from one box to another can be done in a single operation under certain conditions. This is not always true and does not cover all possible scenarios.

For example, in the above test case, the program would incorrectly assume that moving the cat from the 1st box to the 2nd box and then moving the cat from the 3rd box to the 4th box can be done in one operation, which is not valid according to the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
