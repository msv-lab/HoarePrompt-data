Postcondition: `counter` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1', `i` is either 1 or 2, and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`. If `i` is 1, `counter` remains 0 unless the condition in the if part is met.
