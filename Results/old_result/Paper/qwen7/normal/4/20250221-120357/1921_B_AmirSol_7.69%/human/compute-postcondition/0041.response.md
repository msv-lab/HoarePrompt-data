Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `s1` (a string of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'), and `s2` (a string of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'). It returns the total number of positions where the characters in `s1` and `s2` differ, provided both strings have the same length `n` and consist only of '0' and '1'.**
