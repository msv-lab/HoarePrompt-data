Postcondition: `counter` is 2 if `i` is 3 and either `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`, or `i` is 2. Otherwise, `counter` is 1 if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s1[i + 1]` if `i` is less than `n - 1`; otherwise, `counter` is 0. `n` is a positive integer, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1', and `i` is 2.
