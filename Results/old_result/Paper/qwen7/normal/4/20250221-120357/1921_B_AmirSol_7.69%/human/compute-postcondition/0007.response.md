Output State: **`counter` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1', `i` is 0, the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, `i` is less than `n - 1`, the current value of `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]`, and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s1[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code increments the `counter` by 1. Initially, `counter` was 0. After executing `counter += 1`, the new value of `counter` is 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
