Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of boxes, `n`, and the initial and final states of the boxes, `s1` and `s2`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s1` into the final state `s2`.
   - The logic within the function iterates through the strings `s1` and `s2` and counts the necessary operations based on specific conditions.
   - The conditions for incrementing the counter are:
     - If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` and either:
       - `i < n - 1` and `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`, or
       - `i < n - 1` and `s1[i + 1]` is equal to `s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`.
     - In both cases, the counter is incremented by 1 and `i` is incremented by 2 to skip the next box.
     - If none of the above conditions are met, the counter is incremented by 1 and `i` is incremented by 1 to move to the next box.

3. **Output**:
   - The function returns the total count of operations required to transform `s1` into `s2`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as when `i` reaches the end of the string, ensuring that the loop terminates properly.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic in the function appears to correctly account for the operations needed to transform `s1` into `s2` based on the given rules.
   - The function correctly increments the counter based on the specified conditions and ensures that each mismatch is counted appropriately.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes into the desired state.

Correctness: **True**
