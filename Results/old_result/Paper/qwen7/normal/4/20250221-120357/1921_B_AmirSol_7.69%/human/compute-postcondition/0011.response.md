Output State: **`counter` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1', `i` is 0, the current value of `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]` or `i` is equal to `n-1` or the next element in `s1` is equal to the next element in `s2`**.

Explanation: The line `counter += 1` increments the value of `counter` by 1. Since `counter` was initially 0, it is now 1. All other variables (`n`, `s1`, `s2`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition about the elements of `s1` and `s2` also remains valid as no changes were made to these strings or the index `i`.
