Output State: **`frequency_table[num]` is now equal to `k`, `num` is an integer**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `frequency_table[num]` to `k`. Since `frequency_table[num]` was initially greater than `k`, it has now become exactly equal to `k`. The value of `num` remains unchanged, and it is still an integer. The precondition that `num` is an integer and its count in the frequency table was either 1 or the previous count plus 1 is still valid.
