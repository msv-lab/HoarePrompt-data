Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the specified operations.
2. The provided program includes a main loop that processes each test case and a helper function `func_1` that calculates the frequency of each card type but ensures no card type appears more than `k` times.
3. The logic in the main part of the program:
   - If `k > n`, the minimum number of cards is `n` because we cannot perform any exchanges.
   - If `k == n`, the minimum number of cards is `k - 1` because we can exchange all cards into `k - 1` new cards.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to get the frequency table and checks if any card type's frequency is exactly `k`. If so, the minimum number of cards is `k - 1`. Otherwise, the minimum number of cards is `n`.
4. The `func_1` function correctly updates the frequency table to ensure no card type appears more than `k` times.
5. The logic in the main part of the program aligns with the problem statement and the behavior of `func_1`.

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
