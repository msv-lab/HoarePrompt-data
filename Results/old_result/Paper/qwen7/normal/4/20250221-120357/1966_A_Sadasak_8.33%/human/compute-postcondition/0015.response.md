Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the `frequency_table` will contain the final counts of each number in the `arr` list, ensuring that no count exceeds `k`. If a number's count exceeds `k` during any iteration, it will be capped at `k`.

In more detail, for each number `num` in the list `arr`, its count in the `frequency_table` will be the minimum of its actual count in `arr` and `k`. If a number appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its count in `frequency_table` will be exactly `k`. If a number appears fewer than or exactly `k` times, its count in `frequency_table` will match its actual count in `arr`.
