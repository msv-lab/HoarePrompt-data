Output State: **`frequency_table[num]` is now the count of `num` in the table, which is either 1 (if `num` was not previously in the table) or the previous count plus 1 (if `num` was already in the table).**

This means that the `frequency_table` dictionary has been updated such that the key `num` now points to its new frequency count. If `num` was not previously in the `frequency_table`, its value is set to 1. If `num` was already present, its value is incremented by 1.
