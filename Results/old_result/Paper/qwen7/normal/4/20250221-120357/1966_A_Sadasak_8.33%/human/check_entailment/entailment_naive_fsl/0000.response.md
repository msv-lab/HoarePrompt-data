Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where multiple groups of `k` cards with the same number exist, and the frequency of these numbers is less than `k`. Specifically, the program only checks if the exact number of `k` exists in the frequency table and prints `k - 1` if it does, but it does not ensure that the minimum number of cards is achieved by considering all possible groups of `k` cards.

For example, consider the input:
```
6 3
10 20 30 10 20 40
```
The program will output `6`, but the correct output should be `3` because we can group the cards as follows:
- Group 1: 10, 10, 10 (replace with 2 cards)
- Group 2: 20, 20, 20 (replace with 2 cards)
- Group 3: 30, 40 (no action needed as there are only 2 cards)

After the operations, we are left with 3 cards (2 from the first group and 1 from the third group).

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle this scenario and hence is incorrect.
