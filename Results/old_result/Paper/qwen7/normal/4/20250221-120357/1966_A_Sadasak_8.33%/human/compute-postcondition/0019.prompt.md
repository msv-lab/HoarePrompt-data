You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards, and k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100.
def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the `frequency_table` will contain the count of each number in `arr` clamped to a maximum value of `k`. Specifically, for every number `num` in `arr`, `frequency_table[num]` will be the minimum of the actual count of `num` in `arr` and `k`.
    #
    #This means that if a number appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its count in `frequency_table` will be exactly `k`. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` will be the exact count of `num` in `arr`.
    return frequency_table
    #The program returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is a number from the list `arr` and its corresponding value is the minimum of the count of that number in `arr` and `k`. If a number appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its count in `frequency_table` will be exactly `k`. Otherwise, the count will be the exact number of times it appears in `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `arr`, a list of integers, and `k`, an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is a number from the list `arr` and its corresponding value is the minimum of the count of that number in `arr` and `k`. If a number appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its count in `frequency_table` will be exactly `k`. Otherwise, the count will be the exact number of times it appears in `arr`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is a number from the list `arr` and its corresponding value is the minimum of the count of that number in `arr` and `k`. If a number appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its count in `frequency_table` will be exactly `k`. Otherwise, the count will be the exact number of times it appears in `arr`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
