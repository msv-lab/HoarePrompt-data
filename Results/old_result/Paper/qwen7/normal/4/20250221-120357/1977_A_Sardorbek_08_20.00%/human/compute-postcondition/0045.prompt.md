You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `a`, `b` is the last integer obtained from the input split, `c` is the last integer obtained from the second input split, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the loop has completed all its iterations based on the input value of `a`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `a`, indicating that the loop has run exactly `a` times. The values of `b` and `c` will be the last pair of integers entered by the user during the final iteration of the loop. The variable `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 100\) and does not change throughout the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes values for t, n, and m where t is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers between 1 and 100. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
