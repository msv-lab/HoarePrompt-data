Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic in the `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` condition is incorrect. This condition checks if the number of moves `b` is even and the desired number of cubes `c` is also even, which is not relevant to determining whether it's possible to achieve `c` cubes after `b` moves.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if the difference between the number of moves `b` and the desired number of cubes `c` is even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and thus the parity (odd/even nature) of the difference between `b` and `c` determines whether it's possible to achieve `c` cubes after `b` moves.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This corrected version checks if the difference between `b` and `c` is even, which correctly determines whether it's possible to achieve `c` cubes after `b` moves.
