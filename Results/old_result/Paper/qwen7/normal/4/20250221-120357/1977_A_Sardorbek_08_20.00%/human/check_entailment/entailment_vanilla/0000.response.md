Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop to process each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It stores these values in a tuple `q`.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if `b` (number of moves) is equal to `c` (desired number of cubes).
     - If true, it prints 'YES'.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.
   - Otherwise, it checks if `a % 2 == b % 2` (where `a` is the number of test cases, but this should be `b` for consistency).
     - If true, it prints 'Yes'.
     - If false, it prints 'No'.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Use of `a`:**
   - The variable `a` is used to store the number of test cases, not the number of moves.
   - The condition `a % 2 == b % 2` should use `b` instead of `a`.

2. **Logic for Determining Feasibility:**
   - The logic for determining whether it is possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves is flawed.
   - The correct approach is to check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, because each move either adds or removes one cube.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Reading Input:**
   - Reads the number of test cases `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, reads two integers `b` and `c`.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - Checks if `(b - c) % 2 == 0`. This ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even, which is necessary for the operations to balance out.
   - If true, prints 'Yes'.
   - If false, prints 'No'.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis and the corrected program, the original program is incorrect due to the misuse of `a` and the flawed logic for determining feasibility.

**Correctness: False**
