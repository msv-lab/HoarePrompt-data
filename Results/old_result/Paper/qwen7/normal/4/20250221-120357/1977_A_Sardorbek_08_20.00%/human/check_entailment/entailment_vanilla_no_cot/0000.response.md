Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves needs to consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the difference between `n` and `m`. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

```

This version checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which is necessary and sufficient for the operations described (adding or removing one cube per move) to result in exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
