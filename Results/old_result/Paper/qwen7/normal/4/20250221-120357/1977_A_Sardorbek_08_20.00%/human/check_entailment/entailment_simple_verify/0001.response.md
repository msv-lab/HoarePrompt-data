### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, the annotated code, and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap
- The program needs to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Valid inputs: `1 ≤ t ≤ 100` (number of test cases), `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100` (for each test case).

#### Program Code Recap
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Annotated Code Recap
- The program reads an integer `a` representing the number of test cases.
- It then processes each test case by reading two integers `b` and `c`.
- It checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to have `c` cubes after `b` moves:
  - If `b` equals `c`, it prints 'YES'.
  - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO'.
  - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints 'YES'.
  - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

#### Original Assessment Recap
- The original assessment correctly identified the issue with the parity check condition.
- The condition `if a % 2 == b % 2:` was incorrect and should be `if b % 2 == c % 2:`.
- The variable `q` was redundant and can be removed.
- The program uses 'YES' and 'NO' which might not match the required case sensitivity.

#### Corrected Program
Based on the original assessment, the corrected program is:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Systematic Evaluation Using Annotations
1. **Reading Input:**
   - `a` is read as the number of test cases.
   - The loop runs `a` times to process each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - `(b, c)` are read as the number of moves and the desired number of cubes.
   - The conditions are checked:
     - If `b == c`, print 'YES' (correct).
     - If `b < c`, print 'NO' (correct).
     - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, print 'YES' (correct).
     - Otherwise, print 'NO' (correct).

3. **Output State:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program outputs the correct answers based on the conditions.

#### Validation
- The corrected program now correctly checks if the number of moves (`b`) and the desired number of cubes (`c`) have the same parity.
- The variable `q` is removed as it is not used.
- The program uses 'YES' and 'NO' which should be fine if the problem does not specify strict case sensitivity.

### Final Evaluation
The original assessment was accurate. The program has been corrected to handle the parity check properly.

**Final: True**
