### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each operation can either permute the rows or the columns.
   - The sum of the matrix elements after performing the operations should be maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calculates a sum using a loop, which is irrelevant to the problem's requirements.
   - The sum calculated (`sum`) is not used in the final output.
   - The function prints `n + n` as the number of operations, which is incorrect because the operations should be defined as per the problem statement.
   - The operations printed do not follow the correct format. Specifically, they should involve permuting rows or columns as described in the problem, but the current implementation just prints a sequence of numbers without specifying the actual permutations.

Let's break down the annotated code and compare it with the problem requirements:

- **Initialization**:
  ```python
  t = int(input())
  ```
  This reads the number of test cases `t`.

- **Processing Each Test Case**:
  ```python
  for _ in range(t):
      n = int(input())
  ```
  This loops over each test case, reading the size of the matrix `n`.

- **Sum Calculation**:
  ```python
  sum = 1
  for i in range(2, n + 1):
      sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
  ```
  This calculates a sum using a loop, which is irrelevant to the problem. The sum is not used in the final output.

- **Printing the Result**:
  ```python
  print(sum, n + n)
  ```
  This prints the calculated sum and `2n`, which is incorrect because the sum is irrelevant and `2n` should be the number of operations, not a constant.

- **Applying Operations**:
  ```python
  for j in range(1, n + 1):
      print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
      print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
  ```
  This part prints operations, but they are not correct. The operations should permute rows or columns, but the current implementation just prints a sequence of numbers without specifying the actual permutations.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The sum calculation is irrelevant, and the operations printed do not follow the required format.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
