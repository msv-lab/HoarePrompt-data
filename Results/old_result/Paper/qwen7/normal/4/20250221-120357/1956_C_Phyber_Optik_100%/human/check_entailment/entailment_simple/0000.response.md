Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
2. The provided solution calculates the sum using a formula that does not directly relate to the matrix operations specified in the problem. Instead, it computes a sum based on the sequence of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
3. The solution prints the sum and the number of operations as \( 2n \). However, the operations printed do not correspond to the defined operations (Type 1 and Type 2).
4. The operations printed are simply setting rows and columns to permutations of numbers from 1 to \( n \), which does not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix according to the problem's requirements.
5. The logic inside the loop does not align with the problem statement. Specifically, the operations should be designed to maximize the sum of the matrix elements, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly implement the required operations to maximize the sum of the matrix.

Correctness: **False**
