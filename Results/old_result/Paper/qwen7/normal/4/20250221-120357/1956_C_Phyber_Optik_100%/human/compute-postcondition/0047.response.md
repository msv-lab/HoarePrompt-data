Output State: `j` is `n+1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `sum` is 9240.

Explanation: Based on the provided code and the initial conditions, the loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`. Each iteration prints two lines but does not modify any variable outside its scope, specifically `sum`, `i`, or `n`. The variable `j` increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n+1`. Since the loop does not change the value of `sum` and the initial condition specifies that `sum` is 9240, the value of `sum` remains unchanged after all iterations. Therefore, after the loop completes all its iterations, `j` will be `n+1`, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 5, and `sum` will still be 9240.
