Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 2 to `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sum` is updated to its current value plus \((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i\), where `i` must be at least 2.

4. **Analyze the loop increment**:
   - Since the loop starts from 2 and increments `i` by 1 each time, if `i` was at least 2 in the previous iteration, it will now be `i + 1`.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - If `i` was at least 2 in the previous iteration, then `i` will now be `i + 1`.

Given the above analysis, let's formulate the new state:

- The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

Since the problem does not specify any change in `n` and only asks us to adjust the state based on the loop head, we focus on `i`.

If `i` was at least 2 in the previous iteration, then for the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

Therefore, the new state is:
State: **`sum` is updated to its current value plus ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - i * i) * (i + 1), where `i + 1` must be at least 3**.

However, to keep it simple and consistent with the format, we can represent it as:

State: **`sum` is updated to its current value plus ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - i * i) * (i + 1), where `i + 1` is 3 or more**.

But for clarity and simplicity in the final answer:

State: **`sum` is updated to its current value plus ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - i * i) * (i + 1), where `i + 1` is at least 3**.

To match the exact format requested:

State: **`sum` is updated to its current value plus ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - i * i) * (i + 1), where `i + 1` must be at least 3**.
