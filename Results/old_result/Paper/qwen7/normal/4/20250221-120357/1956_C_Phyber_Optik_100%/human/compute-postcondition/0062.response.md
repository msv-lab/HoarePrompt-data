Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `j` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer, but its exact value is not specified.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Breakdown of the Print Statement**:
   - `2`: This is a constant value.
   - `n - j + 1`: Since `j` is 1, this expression simplifies to `n - 1 + 1` which is simply `n`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range object into individual elements from 1 to `n`.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - The print statement will output three parts separated by spaces:
     1. The number `2`.
     2. The value of `n`.
     3. All integers from `1` to `n`, inclusive, separated by spaces.

Given these steps, the output will be:

Output: **2 n 1 2 ... n** (where `n` is a positive integer)
