Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `j` is 2, and `n` must be a positive integer greater than 0.

Given that `j` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `j` is 2, `n + 1` must be greater than 2, meaning `n` must be at least 2 (since `n` is a positive integer).

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` should be incremented by 1, making it 3.
- `n` must still be a positive integer greater than 0, but it must allow `j` to be less than `n + 1`.

Since `j` is now 3, `n` must be at least 3 to allow the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `j` is 3.
- `n` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`j` is 3, `n` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 3**
