Output State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `sum` is 300**

Explanation: The code updates the `sum` variable. Initially, `sum` is 24. The expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` simplifies to `(5 * 5 - 4 * 4) * 5`, which is `(25 - 16) * 5 = 9 * 5 = 45`. Therefore, `sum` is updated to `24 + 45 = 300`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
