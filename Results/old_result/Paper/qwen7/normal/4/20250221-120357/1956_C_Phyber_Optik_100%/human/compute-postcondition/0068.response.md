Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is a positive integer, but its specific value is not provided.

Let's break down the `print` statement:

1. `2` is directly printed as it is a constant.
2. `n - j + 1`: Since `j` is 3, this expression becomes `n - 3 + 1` or `n - 2`.
3. `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range object into individual arguments. The range starts from 1 and goes up to `n` (inclusive).

Given these points, the output will be:

Output: **2, n - 2, 1, 2, ..., n** (where the sequence continues from 1 to n)

This means the first two elements printed are `2` and `n - 2`, followed by all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
