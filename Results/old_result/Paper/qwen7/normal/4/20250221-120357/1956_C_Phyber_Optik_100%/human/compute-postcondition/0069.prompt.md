Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The value of `sum` will be the sum calculated by the loop for the given `n`. Since the loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = n`, the final value of `sum` will be the result of the expression \((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i\) for each `i` from 2 to `n`, summed up. The variable `j` remains `n+1` as it is not affected by the loop. The variable `i` will be `n+1` after the loop completes, and `n` will remain unchanged as it is an input parameter.

For example, if `n` is 5, the loop will run 4 times (for `i = 2, 3, 4, 5`), and the final `sum` will be calculated as follows:
- For `i = 2`: \(2^2 - 1^2) * 2 = 6\)
- For `i = 3`: \(3^2 - 2^2) * 3 = 15\)
- For `i = 4`: \(4^2 - 3^2) * 4 = 28\)
- For `i = 5`: \(5^2 - 4^2) * 5 = 45\)

So, `sum` will be \(6 + 15 + 28 + 45 = 94\).

Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: `sum` is 94, `j` is `n+1`, `i` is `n+1`, `n` is the original input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
    print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `j` is 1, `n` must be a positive integer

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is 2, `n` must be a positive integer

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is 3, `n` must be a positive integer




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
