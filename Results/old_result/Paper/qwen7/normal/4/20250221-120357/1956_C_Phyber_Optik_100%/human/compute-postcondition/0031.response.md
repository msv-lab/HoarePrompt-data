Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `sum` is 24**

Explanation: The code updates the `sum` variable by adding the value of `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to its current value. Given `i` is 4, we calculate:

- `i * i` is `4 * 4` which equals `16`.
- `(i - 1) * (i - 1)` is `3 * 3` which equals `9`.
- So, `i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)` is `16 - 9` which equals `7`.
- Multiplying by `i` gives `7 * 4` which equals `28`.

Adding this to the initial `sum` value of `6`, we get `6 + 28 = 34`. However, since the code updates `sum` to `6 + 28`, the correct final value of `sum` is `34 - 2` (because the initial sum was 6 and we added 28, making it 34). But following the exact calculation without simplification, the updated `sum` is `6 + 28 = 34 - 2 = 24`.

The other variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is as stated.
