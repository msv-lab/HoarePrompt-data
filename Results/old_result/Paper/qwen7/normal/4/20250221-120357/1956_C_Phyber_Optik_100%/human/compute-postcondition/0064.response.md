Given the initial state where `j` is 2 and `n` must be a positive integer, let's break down the `print` statement:

1. The first argument to `print` is `1`.
2. The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given `j` is 2, this becomes `n - 2 + 1` or `n - 1`.
3. The third argument uses `*range(1, n + 1)`, which unpacks the range from 1 to `n` inclusive.

So, the `print` statement will output:
- `1`
- `n - 1`
- All integers from `1` to `n` separated by spaces.

Since `n` is a positive integer but its exact value is not specified, we'll keep it as `n`.

Output: **1, n - 1, 1 2 3 ... n**
