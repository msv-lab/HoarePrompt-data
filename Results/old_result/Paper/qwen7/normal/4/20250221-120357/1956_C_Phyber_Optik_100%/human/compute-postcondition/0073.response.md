Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of two integers: t and n. For each test case, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500. Additionally, the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5. The function returns results based on the values of t and n for each test case.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t` and an integer `n`. It ensures that `t` is within the range 1 to 500 and `n` is within the range 1 to 500. The function also ensures that the sum of the squares of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5. For each test case, the function performs some unspecified operation (not detailed here) using `t` and `n` and returns the results accordingly.
