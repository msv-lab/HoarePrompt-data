Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 3, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user, `x` is equal to half the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` rounded down, `y` is `a + b`, and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even; `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the values entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. It does not affect the values of `t`, `_`, `x`, or `y`. The values of `x` and `y` remain as they were defined before, just with the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The precondition that the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even remains valid.
