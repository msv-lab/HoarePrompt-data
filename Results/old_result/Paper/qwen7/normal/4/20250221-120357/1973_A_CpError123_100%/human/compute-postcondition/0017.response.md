Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user, `x` is equal to half the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` rounded down, `y` is `a + b`, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to their respective integer inputs from the user. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the function does not change `x`, `y`, or the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
