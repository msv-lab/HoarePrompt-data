Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), the value of `t` after executing the code will be the integer input provided by the user, which falls within the specified range. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.
