The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The values of the variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user, `x` is equal to half the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` rounded down, `y` is `a + b`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to their respective integer inputs from the user.**
