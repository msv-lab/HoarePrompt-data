Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is decreased by (3 + 1) * (a[4] - a[3]), `r` is a[4]**.

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value of `a[i + 1]`. Since `i` is 3, `i + 1` equals 4, so `r` is set to `a[4]`. The values of `i` and `k` are not directly affected by this line of code, but `k` was previously modified by a specific calculation involving `a[4]` and `a[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
