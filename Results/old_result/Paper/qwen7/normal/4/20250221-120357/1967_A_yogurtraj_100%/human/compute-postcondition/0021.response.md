Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is unchanged, `rem` is `k % 3`, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`**

Explanation: The code calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`, which is `k % 3`. The value of `i` remains 2, and `k` remains unchanged. The value of `r` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, `rem` is set to `k % 3`, and the other variables retain their original values.
