Output State: **`i` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The code calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` and assigns it to the variable `rem`. The other variables (`i`, `a`, `r`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
