Output State: **`n` is the first integer input split from user input, `k` is the second integer input split from user input, and both inputs must be greater than 0**.

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that the first integer entered by the user is assigned to `n`, and the second integer is assigned to `k`. Both `n` and `k` must be greater than 0 according to the initial state.
