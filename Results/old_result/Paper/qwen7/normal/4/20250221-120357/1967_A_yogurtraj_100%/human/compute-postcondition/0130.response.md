Postcondition: `i` is 0, `k` is adjusted based on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `rem` is 0, `r` is either `a[2]` or `a[1]`, `y` is `n - 4`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` becomes 0, `r` is `a[2]`, and `y` is `n - 5`. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, which is 1 * (a[1] - a[0]), `r` is `a[1]`, and `y` remains `n - 4`.
