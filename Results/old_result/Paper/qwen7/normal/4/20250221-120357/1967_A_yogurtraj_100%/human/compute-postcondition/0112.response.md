Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `n` in the expression `for i in range(0, n - 1):`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - **Variable `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, if the loop is to execute again, `i` should be incremented from 1 to 2.
   - **Variable `n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no modification is mentioned, `n` stays the same and must still be greater than 1.

Given these points, we can conclude the following:

- `i` will be 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 1.

The other variables (`a`, `k`, and `r`) are not part of the loop head and their values are not directly affected by the loop itself without additional information about the loop body. Therefore, they remain unchanged from the previous state.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
