Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `y` is `n - 2`, `r` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `i` is 0.
- The code `y = n - 1 - i` updates the value of `y` to `n - 1 - 0`, which simplifies to `n - 1`. Since `i` was 0, `i` is now incremented by 1 due to the condition in the problem statement, making `i` equal to 1.
- The values of `n`, `r`, and `rem` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.
