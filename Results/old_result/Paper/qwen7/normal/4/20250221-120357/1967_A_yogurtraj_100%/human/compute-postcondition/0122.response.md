Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(0, n - 1):`.
   - The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is given as follows:
     - `i` is either 1 or 2.
     - `k` is decreased by the value of `(1 + 1) * (a[2] - a[1])` if `i` is 1, otherwise `k` remains unchanged.
     - `rem` is 0.
     - `r` is `a[2]`.
     - `y` is `n - 4`.
     - The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` can only be 1 or 2, and the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, the next value of `i` would be 0 if `i` was 1, and 1 if `i` was 2.

4. **Adjust the State Based on the Next Value of `i`:**
   - If `i` was 1, then `k` is decreased by `(1 + 1) * (a[2] - a[1])`.
   - If `i` was 2, then `k` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the Other Variables:**
   - `rem` remains 0.
   - `r` remains `a[2]`.
   - `y` remains `n - 4`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- If `i` was 1, then `k` is decreased by `(1 + 1) * (a[2] - a[1])`.
- If `i` was 2, then `k` remains unchanged.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we consider both cases. However, the loop will run again, so we need to adjust the state based on the possible next values of `i`.

### Possible States:

**Case 1: `i` was 1**
- `i` becomes 0.
- `k` is decreased by `(1 + 1) * (a[2] - a[1])`.

**Case 2: `i` was 2**
- `i` becomes 1.
- `k` remains unchanged.

Since we need to provide a single state that covers both possibilities, we can describe it as follows:

State: **`i` is 0, `k` is decreased by `(1 + 1) * (a[2] - a[1])` if `i` was 1, otherwise `k` remains unchanged, `rem` is 0, `r` is `a[2]`, `y` is `n - 4`**.

However, to be precise and concise, we can summarize it as:

State: **`i` is 0, `k` is `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])` if `i` was 1, otherwise `k` remains unchanged, `rem` is 0, `r` is `a[2]`, `y` is `n - 4`**.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is 0, `k` is `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])` if `i` was 1, otherwise `k` remains unchanged, `rem` is 0, `r` is `a[2]`, `y` is `n - 4`**.
