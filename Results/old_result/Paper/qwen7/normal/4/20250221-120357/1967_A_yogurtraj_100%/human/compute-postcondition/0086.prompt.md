Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `rem` is 0, `i` is 3, `r` is `a[0]`, `k` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 4, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from the input, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
        r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
        rem = k % (i + 1)
        y = n - 1 - i
        k = 0
        break
    else:
        k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
        r = a[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged, `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`, and `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `k` is either reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` or remains unchanged, `r` is set to `a[i + 1]` if the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is false, otherwise `r` is equal to `a[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`. If the condition is true, `y` is `n - 1 - i` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is adjusted based on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. If the condition is true, then `r` is equal to `a[i] + 0 // (i + 1)`, `rem` is equal to `0 % (i + 1)`, `y` is equal to `n - 1 - i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, then `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `i` is incremented by 1, with `r` being updated to `a[i + 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
