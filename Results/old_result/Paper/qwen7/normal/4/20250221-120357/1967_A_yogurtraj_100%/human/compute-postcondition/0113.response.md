Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is unchanged, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`**.

Explanation: The code `r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)` updates the variable `r`. Given that `i` is 2, the term `a[i]` becomes `a[2]`. The term `k // (i + 1)` becomes `k // 3` because `i + 1` is `2 + 1`, which equals 3. Since `n` must be greater than 1, this condition remains valid. The variable `a` is not defined in the initial state, so it is left as `a[2]`. The variable `k` is also not defined, so it remains unchanged.
