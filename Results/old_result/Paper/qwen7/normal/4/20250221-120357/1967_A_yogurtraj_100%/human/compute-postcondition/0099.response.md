Output State: **`y` is 0, `ii` is `m`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `r` is the first element of the list `a`, `rem` is 0.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `y`. None of the other variables (`ii`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `rem`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
