Let's break down the initial state and the expression to be printed step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`.
   - `k` is not 0.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is `n - 4`.

2. **Expression to be Printed:**
   - The expression is `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`.

3. **Determine the Value of `r`:**
   - `r` is defined as `a[2] + k // 3`.
   - Since `k` is not 0, `k // 3` will be an integer division of `k` by 3.
   - Without knowing the exact value of `k`, we know it contributes to `r`, but we need to focus on the overall expression.

4. **Determine the Value of `k % n`:**
   - `k % n` is the remainder when `k` is divided by `n`.
   - Since `k` is not 0, `k % n` will be a value between 0 and `n-1`.

5. **Substitute the Values into the Expression:**
   - We need to express the final printed value in terms of known and unknown values.
   - The expression is `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`.
   - Since `r = a[2] + k // 3`, let's denote `a[2]` as `a2` for simplicity.
   - So, `r = a2 + k // 3`.
   - Therefore, the expression becomes: \((a2 + k // 3 - 1) * n + 1 + k % n\).

6. **Final Expression Simplification:**
   - The exact value of `a2` is not provided, but we can leave it as `a2`.
   - The expression simplifies to: \((a2 + k // 3 - 1) * n + 1 + k % n\).

Given the above breakdown, the output will be:

Output: **(a2 + k // 3 - 1) * n + 1 + k % n (where a2 is the third element of the list a, k is not 0, and n is the value of n)**
