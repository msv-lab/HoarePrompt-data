Output State: **`i` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`**.

Explanation: The value of `r` is assigned the value of `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. The initial values of `i` and `a` remain unchanged. The condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is not directly used in the calculation of `r`, but it remains a valid precondition.
