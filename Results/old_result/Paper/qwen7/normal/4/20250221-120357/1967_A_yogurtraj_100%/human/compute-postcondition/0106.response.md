Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is 0, `r` is 0, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any variable values but indicates that the program will exit the current loop or conditional block. All the initial conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
