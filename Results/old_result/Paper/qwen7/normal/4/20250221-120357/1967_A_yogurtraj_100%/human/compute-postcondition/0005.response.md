Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers from the user input, `n` is the first integer in the sorted list, `k` is the second integer in the sorted list, `r` is equal to `a[0]` (which is `n`), `rem` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `rem` to 0. This does not affect the values of `a`, `n`, `k`, or `r`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with `rem` being set to 0.
