Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is decreased by the value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`**.

Given the initial state where `i` is 2, the line of code `k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` updates the value of `i` to 1 before performing the calculation. However, since `i` was initially 2, the updated value of `i` is now 1. The value of `k` is decreased by the calculated value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, which simplifies to `3 * (a[3] - a[2])` given that `i` is now 1. The conditions that `n` must be greater than 1 remain unchanged.
