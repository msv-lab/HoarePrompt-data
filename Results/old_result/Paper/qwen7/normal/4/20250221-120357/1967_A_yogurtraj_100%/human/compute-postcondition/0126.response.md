Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is 0, `rem` is 0, `r` is `a[2]`, `y` is `n - 5`**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `i` is 0, which means the condition `if i was 1` was not met, so `k` remains unchanged.
- The code sets `k = 0`.
- Since `k` is now 0, `rem` becomes `k % 1`, which is 0.
- `r` is calculated as `a[2] + k // 1`, which simplifies to `a[2] + 0`, so `r` is `a[2]`.
- The value of `y` remains `n - 5` as it was not affected by the code.
