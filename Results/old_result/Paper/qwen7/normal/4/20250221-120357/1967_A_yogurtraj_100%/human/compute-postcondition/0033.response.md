Output State: **`i` is 3, `r` is `a[3] + 0 // 4`, `rem` is `0 % 4`, `y` is `n - 1 - 3`, `k` is 0**

Explanation: The code `k = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `k`. This changes the value of `k` from its previous state, but does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, `i` remains `3`, `r` is now `a[3] + 0 // 4` (since `k` is now `0`), `rem` is `0 % 4` (which is `0`), and `y` is `n - 1 - 3` (unchanged).
