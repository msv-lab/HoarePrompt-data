Postcondition: `b` is the final input string provided by the user, and `k` is a list containing the cumulative count of '1's from all input strings provided during the loop executions. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, the postcondition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the if condition.
