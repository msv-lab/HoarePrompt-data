Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, `i` is equal to the previous value of `i` plus 1, `k` is an empty list, and `b` and `loop_count` are the last input string and integer respectively.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    b = input()
    if '1' in b:
        k.append(b.count('1'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, and `b` is an input string. If the string `b` contains the character '1', then `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b`. If the string `b` does not contain the character '1', then `k` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is the new input integer (one more than the previous input), `b` is updated to the new input string. If `b` contains the character '1', `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in `b`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` is the next input integer (one more than the previous input), `b` is the next input string, `k` is a list with one additional element which is the count of '1's in the string `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
