Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is the final length of the list `a` plus 1, `m` is an input integer from the user, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` will be a string consisting of the first elements of each list in `a`, and `last_row` will be a string consisting of the last elements of each list in `a`.**

The code initializes an empty list `a`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `first_row`, and `last_row`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
