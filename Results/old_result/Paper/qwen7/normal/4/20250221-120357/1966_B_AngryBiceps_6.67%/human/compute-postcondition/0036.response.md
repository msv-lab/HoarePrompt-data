Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` contains an input value, `first_row` is updated by adding the first element of the last list in `a`.**

Explanation: The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` updates the variable `first_row` by adding the first element of the last list in the list `a`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
