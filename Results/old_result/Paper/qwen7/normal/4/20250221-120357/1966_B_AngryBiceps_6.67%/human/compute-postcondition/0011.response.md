Output State: **`a` is a list with one element which is the input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends the input from the user to the list `a`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `a`, we only know that after executing the code, `a` will contain exactly one element, which is the input provided by the user.
