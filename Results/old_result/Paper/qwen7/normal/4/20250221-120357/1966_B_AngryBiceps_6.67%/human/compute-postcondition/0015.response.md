Output State: **`a` is a list with two elements, where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input from the user; `first_row` is the first element of the original input; `last_row` is increased by the last element of the only list in `a`; `i` is 1; `n` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends a new input from the user to the list `a`. Since `a` initially contained one element (the original input), after appending, `a` now contains two elements: the original input and the new input. The values of `first_row`, `last_row`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
