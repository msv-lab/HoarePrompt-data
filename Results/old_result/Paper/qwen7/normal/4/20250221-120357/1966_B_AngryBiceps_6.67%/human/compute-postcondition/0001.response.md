Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `_` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ _ ≤ 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The variable `_` was a positive integer within the range [1, 10^4] before the code execution, but its specific value is not known after the code execution since no further operations are performed on it. Therefore, it remains a positive integer within the specified range.
