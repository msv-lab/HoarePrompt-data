Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` part of the for loop. This means the loop variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the input value from `int(input())` are the key variables here.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as the input value is a positive integer. The loop will stop when the input value is 0 or a negative number.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postconditions are:
   - `i` will be -1 (indicating the loop has completed)
   - `n` will be the final length of the list `a`
   - `a` will contain all the inputs provided by the user
   - `first_row` will be a string consisting of the first elements of each list in `a`
   - `last_row` will be a string consisting of the last elements of each list in `a`
   - The first row (`first_row`) consists of identical elements if and only if the length of the set of `first_row` is 1.
   - The first row is not equal to the last row (`last_row`).

4. **Next Iteration State**: For the loop to execute one more time, the user must provide a positive integer input. After the loop runs once more, the new state will be:
   - `i` will be -1 (indicating the loop has completed after the additional input)
   - `n` will be incremented by 1 (since the loop just added one more input to `a`)
   - `a` will now contain one more element (the latest input from the user)
   - `first_row` will be updated to include the first element of the new list
   - `last_row` will be updated to include the last element of the new list

5. **Adjusting the States**: Based on the above, the only states that need to be adjusted are those related to the loop head, which are the input value and the loop counter `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is -1, `n` is the final length of the list `a` plus 1, `a` will contain all the inputs provided by the user including the new one, `first_row` will be a string consisting of the first elements of each list in `a`, and `last_row` will be a string consisting of the last elements of each list in `a`**.
