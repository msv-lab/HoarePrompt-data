Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current Values**:
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.

3. **Determine the Next Values**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0.

Given these points, let's update the states accordingly:

- `i` will be incremented by 1, so it becomes 1.
- `n` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is appended with an input value, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `last_row` is the sum of its previous value and the last element of the last list in `a`, `first_row` is equal to the first element of the last list in `a`**
