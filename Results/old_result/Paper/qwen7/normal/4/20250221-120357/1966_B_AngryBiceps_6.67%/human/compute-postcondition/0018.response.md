Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `a` will be a list containing all the inputs provided by the user, with each input as a separate element. `first_row` will be a string consisting of the first character of each input string in `a`. `last_row` will be a string consisting of the last character of each input string in `a`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, and `n` will remain the same as it was initially.**

This means that if the user provided `n` inputs, `a` will contain these `n` inputs, `first_row` will concatenate the first characters of all these inputs, and `last_row` will concatenate the last characters of all these inputs.
