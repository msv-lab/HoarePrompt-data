Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user, `first_row` is the first character of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last element in the list `a` to the string `last_row`. Since `a` contains only one element (which is the input from the user), `a[-1]` refers to that single element, and `a[-1][-1]` refers to its last character. The value of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `first_row` remains unchanged.
