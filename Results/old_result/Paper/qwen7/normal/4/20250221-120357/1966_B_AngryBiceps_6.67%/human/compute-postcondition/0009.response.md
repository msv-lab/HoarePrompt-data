Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list with one element which is the input from the user; `first_row` is updated to include the first element of the only list in `a`; `last_row` is the last element of the only list in `a`.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` updates `last_row` by adding the last element of the only list in `a` to its current value. Since `a` is a list with one element (which is the input from the user), `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last (and only) element of that list. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 and that `first_row` is updated to include the first element of the only list in `a` remains unchanged.
