Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is the final length of the list `a` plus 1, `m` is an input integer from the user, `a` will contain all the inputs provided by the user including the new one, `first_row` will be a string consisting of the first elements of each list in `a`, and `last_row` will be a string consisting of the last elements of each list in `a`.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input from the user and splits them into two variables `n` and `m`. The initial values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `m` is assigned the second integer input. The lists `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` are not directly affected by this code but will be updated based on future inputs.
