Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers where the second last element has been decremented by 1 for each iteration, `n` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the beginning up to the first space, `k` is at least 5 and is now even, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 3, `g` is 3, and the second last element of `a` is decremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0, at which point `g` will increment, and `a[d]` is also decremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0, at which point the loop breaks.**
