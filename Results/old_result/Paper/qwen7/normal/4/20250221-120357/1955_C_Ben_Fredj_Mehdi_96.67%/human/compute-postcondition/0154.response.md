Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers split from the input string, `n` is the first element of `a`, `k` is the second element of `a`, and `k` is not equal to 99999999999999, `n` is not equal to 2, `k` is not equal to 1000000000, `k` is not equal to 199999999999999, `k` is not equal to 100000000000, `k` is not equal to 200000000000, `k` is not equal to 2147483648, `n` is not equal to 101, either `n` is not equal to 5 or `k` is not equal to 2147483648, and `(n != 20 or k != 10000000000)`. If `n` is 20 and `k` is 1000000000, `n` remains 20 and `k` remains 1000000000. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to 3000000000, `k` is not less than the sum of all elements in `a`, and if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `a`, `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, each element in `a` is decremented by half of `k`, `g` is incremented by 1, and if any element in `a` becomes 0, the corresponding index `d` is decremented by 1. If `k % 2 == 1`, `d` is further decremented by 1.
