Output State: **`a[d]` is 0, `a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 1`, `g` is incremented by 1 if `a[g]` equals 0, and `d` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `d` is decremented by 1. The value of `a[d]` is explicitly given as 0, so it remains unchanged. The condition that if `a[g]` equals 0, then `g` is incremented by 1, is still valid and will be checked after the decrement of `d`.
