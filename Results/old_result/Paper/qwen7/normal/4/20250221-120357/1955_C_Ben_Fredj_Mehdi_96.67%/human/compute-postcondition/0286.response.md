Output: **0**

Explanation: The initial state does not provide any specific values for the variables other than `t > 0`, `z = 2`, and the description of how `a`, `n`, and `k` are derived from the input. However, the `print('0')` statement directly prints the string `'0'`, regardless of the values of other variables. Therefore, the output is simply `'0'`.
