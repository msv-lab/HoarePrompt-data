At which point in the program could such an exception occur? The exception could occur when trying to convert `a[g]` or `a[d]` to an integer using `int(a[g])` or `int(a[d])`. If `a[g]` or `a[d]` is not a valid integer, a `ValueError` will be raised.

Summarizing what the try except statement accomplishes: The try block attempts to decrement the values of `a[g]` and `a[d]` by 1 after converting them to integers. If `a[g]` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. Similarly, if `a[d]` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If any of these operations fail due to a `ValueError`, the except block is executed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 3`, `k` must be `k // 2` or greater, `a[d]` is decreased by 1. If `a[d]` is equal to 0, then `d` is `d_prev - 1` and `g` is increased by 1 if `a[g]` was 0 before. If a `ValueError` occurs, the state is unknown and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.**
