You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` must still be greater than 0, `z` will be equal to `t - 1`, `a` will be a list of integers obtained from the final input split by spaces, `n` will be the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the beginning up to the first space, and `k` will be the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the character right after the first space.
    #
    #The loop processes the input `a` based on the value of `k`. Depending on the value of `k`, different operations are performed on `a`. If `k` is one of the special values like 1999999998, 1999999999, 99999999999, etc., `k` remains unchanged. If `k` is such that it causes elements in `a` to be decremented, the process continues until `k` is fully applied or `a` contains non-positive elements. In the end, `a` will be transformed based on the operations performed over all iterations, and `k` will reflect the final value after processing through the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) indicating the number of sub-cases. For each sub-case, it reads two positive integers \( n \) and \( k \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) positive integers representing the durability of the ships. Based on the value of \( k \), the function either prints a specific integer directly or modifies the list \( a \) by decrementing its elements. Finally, it prints the count of zero-valued elements in the list \( a \) after all modifications.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains several hard-coded conditions that handle specific values of `n` and `k`, which do not cover all possible cases. For instance, the program includes conditions like:

- `if k == 1999999998: print('0')`
- `elif k == 1999999999: print('1')`
- `elif n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and (a[0] == 1): print('1')`

These conditions are hardcoded and do not account for the general behavior of the Kraken's attacks. The program should dynamically handle the attacks based on the initial durability of the ships and the total number of attacks `k`.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
3 10
1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

However, the program will not handle this case correctly because it does not simulate the dynamic reduction of durability over multiple attacks. The program should iterate through the attacks and reduce the durability of the ships accordingly, but it fails to do so due to the hardcoded conditions.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
