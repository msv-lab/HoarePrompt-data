Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` is 0, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values provided as input, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values provided as input, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values provided as input, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `_` is the loop counter which equals `n`.

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop.
- The variable `r` remains an empty list as it was not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` is reduced to 0 since the loop runs for `n` times and `n` is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.
- The set `cx` contains all unique `x` values that were provided as input during the loop iterations.
- The variable `ax` holds the smallest `x` value among all inputs because `ax` is updated to `min(x, ax)` whenever `a` is 2.
- The variable `bx` holds the largest `x` value among all inputs because `bx` is updated to `max(x, bx)` whenever `a` is 1.
- The variables `a` and `x` represent the last input values provided when the loop terminated.
- The variable `_` represents the loop counter which equals `n` after the loop has completed all its iterations, but since `n` is 0, `_` is effectively 0.
