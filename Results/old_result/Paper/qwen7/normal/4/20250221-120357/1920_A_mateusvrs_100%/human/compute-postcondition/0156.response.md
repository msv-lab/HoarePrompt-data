Output State: **`n` is equal to the total number of iterations executed, `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` where `a` was 1, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was not 1, `r` is a list containing one element which is 0, `t` is 0, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` where `a` was 2, `a` is the last input integer, and `x` is the last input integer.**

The code `r.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `r`. Since `r` could previously be `0` or any other value based on conditions, now it is a list containing the single element `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
