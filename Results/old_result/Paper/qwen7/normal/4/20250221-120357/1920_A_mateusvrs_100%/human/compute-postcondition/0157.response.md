Postcondition: **`n` must be equal to the total number of iterations executed, `bx` will be the maximum value among all `x` where `a` was 1, `cx` will be a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was not 1, `r` could be 0 or any other value based on the conditions, `t` is 0, `ax` will be the minimum value among all `x` where `a` was 2, `a` is the last input integer, and `x` is the last input integer, and `bx` is not greater than `ax`**
