Output State: **Postcondition: `n` is 0, `cx` is an empty set, `i` is undefined, `tmp` is either 0 or the number of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` where `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` where `a` was 1, `r` could be 0 or any other value based on the conditions, `t` is 0, and `a` is the last input integer, `x` is the last input integer.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` becomes 0 because it initially equals the size of `cx`, and `cx` is processed down to an empty set during the iterations. Since the loop processes each element in `cx` exactly once, `i` would be undefined as there are no more elements left in `cx`. The variable `tmp` will hold the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`, where `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` where `a` was 1, and `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` where `a` was 2. The other variables (`r`, `t`, `a`, and `x`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
