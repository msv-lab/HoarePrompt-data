Postcondition: **`n` is equal to the total number of iterations executed, `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` where `a` was 1, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was not 1, `r` is a list containing either one element which is 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `t` is 0, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` where `a` was 2, `a` is the last input integer, and `x` is the last input integer. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, then `r` is [0]. Otherwise, `n` is 0, `cx` is an empty set, `i` is undefined, `tmp` is either 0 or the number of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`, and `r` is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**
