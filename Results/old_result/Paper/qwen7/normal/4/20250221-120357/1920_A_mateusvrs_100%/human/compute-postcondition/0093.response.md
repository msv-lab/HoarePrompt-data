Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input, `cx` is a set containing `x`.**

Explanation: The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `x` was previously assigned the second integer from the input, it is now included in the set `cx`. The other variables remain unchanged.
