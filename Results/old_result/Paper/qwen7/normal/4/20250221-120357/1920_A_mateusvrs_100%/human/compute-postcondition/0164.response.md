Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` from the iterable `cx`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `cx`. The value of `i` will take on each element of `cx` in sequence.

3. **Determine the postconditions for the loop**: 
   - `n` is equal to the size of `cx`.
   - `cx` contains at least one element.
   - If the index `i` is within the bounds defined by `bx` and `ax` (i.e., `bx <= i < ax`), then `tmp` is increased by 1.
   - Otherwise, the values of `n`, `cx`, and `i` remain unchanged.

4. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is equal to the size of `cx`.
   - `cx` contains at least one element.
   - `tmp` might have been incremented based on the value of `i` relative to `bx` and `ax`.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` takes on each element of `cx` in sequence, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `cx`.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is equal to the size of `cx`, which does not change during the loop.
   - `cx` remains unchanged because the loop is iterating over its elements but does not modify the list itself.
   - `tmp` may or may not have been incremented, depending on the value of `i` relative to `bx` and `ax`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be the next element in `cx`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `cx` remains unchanged.
- `tmp` may or may not have been incremented, but its exact value is not specified in the problem statement.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is equal to the size of `cx`, `cx` contains at least one element, `i` is the next element in `cx`, and `tmp` may or may not have been incremented.**
