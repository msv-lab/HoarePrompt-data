Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `_` (which is just a placeholder indicating a generic loop variable) and `n`. Since `_` is just a placeholder, it doesn't affect the loop condition. The key variable here is `n`.

2. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `a` is an integer from the input.
   - `x` is an integer from the input.

4. **Loop body behavior**:
   - If `a` equals 1, then `bx` is the maximum value between `x` and the previous value of `bx`.
   - If `a` equals 2, then `ax` is the minimum value between `x` and the previous value of `ax`.
   - Otherwise, `x` is added to the set `cx`, and `cx` contains the elements `{x}`.

5. **Adjusting the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0, `n` must be decremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - The values of `a` and `x` remain unchanged unless they are modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, they stay the same.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `n` must be greater than 0 (since `n` was greater than 1 before and is decremented by 1).
- `a` remains the same.
- `x` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input**
