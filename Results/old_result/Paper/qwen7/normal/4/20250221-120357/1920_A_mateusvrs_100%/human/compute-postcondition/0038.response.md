Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` is 0, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values provided during the loop's iterations, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values provided where `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values provided where `a` was 1, or `bx` remains -1 if no such `x` values were provided, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `_` is the total number of iterations which equals `n` initially.

This means after the loop completes all its iterations:
- `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop.
- `r` remains an empty list as it was not modified within the loop.
- `n` becomes 0 because the loop runs `n` times and upon completion, `n` is effectively decremented to 0.
- `cx` contains all unique `x` values that were added to it during the loop.
- `ax` is the smallest `x` value among those for which `a` was 2.
- `bx` is the largest `x` value among those for which `a` was 1, or remains -1 if no such `x` values were provided.
- `_` reflects the total number of iterations, which is equal to the original value of `n`.
