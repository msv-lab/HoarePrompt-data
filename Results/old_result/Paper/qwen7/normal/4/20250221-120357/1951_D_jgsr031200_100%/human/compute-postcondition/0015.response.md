Output State: **`i` is \(n - k + 1\), `costs` is a list containing two elements, the first element is \(n - k + 1\) and the second element is 1, `h` is \(\frac{n}{n - k + 1}\), `n` is \(n - (n - k + 1) * curr\)**.

Explanation: The code `n -= i * curr` subtracts `i * curr` from `n`. Given that `i` is \(n - k + 1\) and `curr` is the first element of the `costs` list, which is \(n - k + 1\), the new value of `n` becomes \(n - (n - k + 1) * (n - k + 1)\). All other variables remain unchanged.
