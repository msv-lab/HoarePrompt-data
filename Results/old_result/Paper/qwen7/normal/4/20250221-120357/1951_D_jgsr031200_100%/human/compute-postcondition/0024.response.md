Output State: `h` is the sum of all integers from 1 to \(n - k + 1\), `n` is 0, `i` is the last cost used, which is \(n - k + 1\), and `costs` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 1 and the second element is 0.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each cost in the `costs` list. Initially, `costs` contains \(n - k + 1\) and 1. In each iteration, `curr` is calculated as `n // i`, where `i` is the current cost. Then, `h` is incremented by `curr`, and `n` is reduced by `i * curr`. This process continues until `n` becomes 0. Since `n` is completely divided into parts by the costs, the final value of `h` will be the sum of all integers from 1 to \(n - k + 1\). After all iterations, `n` will be 0, and the last cost used will be \(n - k + 1\). The `costs` list will be updated to reflect the remaining costs, which in this case will be 1 and 0.
