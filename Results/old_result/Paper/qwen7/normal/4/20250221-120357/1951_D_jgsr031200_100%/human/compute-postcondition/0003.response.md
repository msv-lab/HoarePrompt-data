Output: **1**

Explanation: Given the initial state where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(n\) is equal to \(k\), the print statement simply outputs the integer `1`. Since no other variables or objects are involved in this print statement, the output is directly `1`.
