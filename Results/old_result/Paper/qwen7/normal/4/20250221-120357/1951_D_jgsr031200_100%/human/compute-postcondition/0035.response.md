Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers with a constraint of 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. If `n` equals `k`, the function prints "YES" followed by 1 and 1, then returns `k`. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO" and returns `None`. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of integers from 1 to `n - k + 1` and updates `n` accordingly. If the calculated sum (`h`) is less than `k`, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES", 2, the updated `costs` list (which is [0, 1]), and returns `None`.**
