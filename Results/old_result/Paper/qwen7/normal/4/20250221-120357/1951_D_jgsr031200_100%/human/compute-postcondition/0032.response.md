Postcondition: **`h` is the sum of all integers from 1 to \(n - k + 1\), `n` is 0, `i` is 1, and `costs` is a list containing [0, 1]**.

This means that regardless of whether the condition `h < k` is true or false, the final state of the program variables is the same: `h` represents the sum of all integers from 1 to \(n - k + 1\), `n` is 0, `i` is 1, and `costs` is a list containing [0, 1].
