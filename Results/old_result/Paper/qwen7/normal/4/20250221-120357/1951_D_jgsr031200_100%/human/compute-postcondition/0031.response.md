Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `n` is 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `costs` is a list containing `[0, 1]`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(*costs)` statement unpacks the list `costs` and prints its elements separated by spaces.

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - Since `costs` is explicitly defined as `[0, 1]`, the `print(*costs)` statement will print the elements of this list.

Output: **0 1**
