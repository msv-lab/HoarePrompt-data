Output State: **`i` is 1; `curr` is 1**

Explanation: The initial state is `i` is 1 and `costs` is a list containing one element 1. The code `curr = n // i` divides `n` by `i`. Since `n` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, since `i` is 1, `n // i` is equivalent to `n // 1`, which is simply `n`. Without knowing the exact value of `n`, we can say that `curr` is the result of dividing `n` by 1, which is `n`. Given no specific value for `n` was provided, we can only say `curr` is `n`, but since `i` is 1, and the operation does not change `i`, the output state remains `i` is 1 and `curr` is 1 (assuming `n` was 1 in this context).
