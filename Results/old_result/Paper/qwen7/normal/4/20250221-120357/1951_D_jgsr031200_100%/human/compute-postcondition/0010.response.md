Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18} and n ≥ k; `k` is a positive integer; `costs` is a list containing two elements, the first element is `n - k + 1` and the second element is `1`.**

This means that the initial conditions for `n` and `k` remain the same, and a new list `costs` has been created with the specified values.
