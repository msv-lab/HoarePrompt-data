Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `costs` is a list containing `[0, 1]`.
- `h` is the sum of all integers from 1 to \(n - k + 1\). Given that `n` is 0, this means `h` is the sum of all integers from 1 to \(0 - k + 1\), which simplifies to the sum of all integers from 1 to \(-k + 1\). Since `k` is not explicitly defined but `h` is stated to be less than `k`, we can infer that `k` must be greater than 0. However, the specific value of `k` does not affect the output of the print statement because the print statement itself does not depend on the value of `h`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
