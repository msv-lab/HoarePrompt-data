### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Initial Checks:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It checks if `n` (the number of coins Alice has) is equal to `k` (the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).
     - If `n == k`, it prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel, allowing Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot afford even one jewel at the minimum price.
   - If `n >= k`, it proceeds to the next logic.

2. **Logic for `n >= k`:**
   - The program calculates the number of stalls needed and their respective prices.
   - It initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]`, which means the first stall will have a price of `n - k + 1` coins per jewel.
   - It then iterates over the `costs` array, calculating how many jewels Alice can buy at each stall and updating `n` accordingly.
   - After processing all stalls, it checks if the total number of jewels bought (`h`) is at least `k`.
     - If `h < k`, it prints "NO" because the setup fails to meet the requirement.
     - If `h >= k`, it prints "YES" and the number of stalls (2 in this case), followed by the prices of the stalls.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n == k` correctly by setting up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   - It also correctly handles the case where `n < k` by printing "NO".
   - For `n >= k`, it ensures that the total number of jewels bought is at least `k`.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The output format matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
