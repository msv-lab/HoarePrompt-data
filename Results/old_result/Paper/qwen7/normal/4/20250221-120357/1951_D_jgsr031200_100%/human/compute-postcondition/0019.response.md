Output State: **`i` is 1; `curr` is 1; `n` is `n - 1 * 1`, which simplifies to `n - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 1, and the value of `curr` also remains unchanged at 1. The variable `n` is updated to `n - 1 * 1`, which simplifies to `n - 1`. All other variables from the initial state remain unaffected.
