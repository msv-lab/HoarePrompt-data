Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for node in g[x]:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `node` and `x`.

2. **Understand the postcondition from the previous iteration**: 
   - `g[1]` contains at least one element.
   - `node` is not equal to `p`.
   - `stack` contains an additional tuple `(node, x)`.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if there are more nodes in `g[x]` to iterate over.
   - Since `node` is not equal to `p`, it means `node` is some element in `g[x]` that is not `p`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `node` must be set to the next element in `g[x]` that is not `p`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `g[1]` still needs to contain at least one element (unchanged).
   - `node` needs to be set to the next element in `g[x]` that is not `p`.
   - `stack` will contain another tuple `(node, x)` as per the loop body, but since we are only adjusting the state at the start of the next iteration, we don't need to explicitly mention this change here.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`g[1]` contains at least one element, `node` is the next element in `g[x]` that is not equal to `p`, and `stack` contains an additional tuple `(node, x)`**. 

However, since we are only focusing on the variables in the loop head, the primary adjustment is on `node`.

Final Answer:
State: **`g[1]` contains at least one element, `node` is the next element in `g[x]` that is not equal to `p`**.
