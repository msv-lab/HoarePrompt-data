The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `edges`. `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(a, b)` represents an edge connecting vertices `a` and `b`.

The function returns a value based on the following conditions:
- Case_1: If `k` is greater than `n-1`, the function returns an error message indicating that the number of edges to be removed cannot exceed the number of vertices minus one.
- Case_2: Otherwise, the function returns the list of `k` edges that will be removed from the tree.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `k`, and `edges`, and return either an error message if the number of edges to be removed exceeds the maximum possible number of edges in a tree, or the list of `k` edges to be removed.
