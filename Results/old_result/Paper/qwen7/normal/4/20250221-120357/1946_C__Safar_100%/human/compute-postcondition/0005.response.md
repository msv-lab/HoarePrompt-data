Output State: **`stack` contains the tuple (1, 1), `x` is 1, `p` is 1, `A` is an integer, `g` is a dictionary representing the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n - 1`, `n` is the number of vertices in the tree, `visited` is an empty set, `d` is a dictionary with key (1) and value 1, `r` is 0**

Explanation: The code `x, p = stack[-1]` pops the last element from the `stack`, which is the tuple `(1, 1)`. It then assigns the first element of the tuple to `x` and the second element to `p`. Therefore, `x` is now 1 and `p` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
