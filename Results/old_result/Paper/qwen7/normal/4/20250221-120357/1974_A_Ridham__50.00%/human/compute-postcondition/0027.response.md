Output State: **`remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4` if `y` is odd, or `15 * (y // 2) - y * 4` if `y` is even; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0 (now `n - 1`); `result` is a list containing one element, either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`; `space_x` is equal to `x`; `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`; `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`; `x` is an input integer; `y` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `x` and `y`, from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This changes the values of `x` and `y`, but does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for all variables except `x` and `y`, which are now input integers.
