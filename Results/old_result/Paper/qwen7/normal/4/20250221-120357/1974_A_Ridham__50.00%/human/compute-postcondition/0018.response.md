Output State: **`remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4` if `y` is odd, or `15 * (y // 2) - y * 4` if `y` is even; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `result` is an empty list; `x` is an input integer; `y` is an input integer; `space_x` is equal to `x`; `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`; `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`; `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`; `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `extra_space` which is the difference between `space_x` and `remaining_cells`. Since `space_x` is defined as `x` and `remaining_cells` is already calculated based on the value of `y`, `extra_space` is now a new variable holding the value of `x - remaining_cells`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
