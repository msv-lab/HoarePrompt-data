You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        space_x = x * 1
        space_y = y * 4
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if space_x % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = space_x // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers \(x\) and \(y\). For each test case, it calculates the number of screens required based on certain conditions involving \(x\) and \(y\), and appends the result to a list. Finally, it prints the elements of the list, each representing the number of screens required for the respective test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required. Specifically, it fails to account for the fact that a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the remaining cells on a screen must be filled before moving to the next screen. Here's an example where the program fails:

Consider the input `x = 12` and `y = 4`. According to the problem, we need to place 12 icons of size 1x1 and 4 icons of size 2x2. 

- 4 icons of size 2x2 occupy \(4 \times 4 = 16\) cells.
- Since each screen has 15 cells, we need at least 2 screens to accommodate these 16 cells (one full screen and one partial screen).

However, the program calculates the space required and the number of screens needed incorrectly. Let's break down the calculation:

1. `space_x = x * 1 = 12` (cells occupied by 1x1 icons).
2. `space_y = y * 4 = 16` (cells occupied by 2x2 icons).
3. `total_space = space_y + space_x = 28` (total cells occupied).
4. `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1 = 4 // 2 + 1 = 3` (since 4 icons of 2x2 require 2 full screens and 1 partial screen).

The program then calculates the remaining cells and checks if the remaining cells can fit the 1x1 icons. However, this approach does not correctly handle the placement of icons on the screens. 

To fix this, we need to ensure that we fill each screen completely before moving to the next one. The correct approach would involve calculating how many full screens are needed for the 2x2 icons and then checking if the remaining cells can fit the 1x1 icons.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Calculate the number of full screens needed for 2x2 icons
        full_screens_for_y = y // 2
        remaining_2x2 = y % 2
        # Calculate the number of cells used by 2x2 icons
        cells_used_by_2x2 = full_screens_for_y * 4 + (remaining_2x2 * 4)
        # Calculate the remaining cells on the screen
        remaining_cells = 15 - cells_used_by_2x2
        # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit in the remaining cells
        icons_fitting_in_remaining_cells = min(x, remaining_cells)
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons
        additional_screens_for_x = (x - icons_fitting_in_remaining_cells) // 15
        if (x - icons_fitting_in_remaining_cells) % 15 != 0:
            additional_screens_for_x += 1
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = full_screens_for_y + additional_screens_for_x
        result.append(total_screens)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the 2x2 icons are placed optimally and the remaining cells are filled with 1x1 icons, thus providing the correct minimum number of screens required.
