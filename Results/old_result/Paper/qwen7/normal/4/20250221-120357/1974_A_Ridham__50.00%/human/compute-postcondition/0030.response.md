Output State: **`remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4` if `y` is odd, or `15 * (y // 2) - y * 4` if `y` is even; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0 (now `n - 1`); `result` is a list containing one element, either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`; `space_x` is equal to `x * 1` which is just `x`; `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`; `total_space` is equal to `y * 8`; `y` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `total_space` to be the sum of `space_y` and `space_x`. Since `space_y` is `y * 4` and `space_x` is `x`, their sum is `y * 4 + x`, which simplifies to `y * 8` because `x` was previously defined as `space_x` being equal to `x * 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
