Output State: **`remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0 (now `n - 1`), `result` is a list containing two elements, `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1` which is just `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 8`, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, and if `space_x % 15 == 0`, `extra_screen` is `space_x // 15`; otherwise, `extra_screen` is `(space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` to the list `result`. Since `result` was initially a list containing one element, after appending, it now contains two elements: `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
