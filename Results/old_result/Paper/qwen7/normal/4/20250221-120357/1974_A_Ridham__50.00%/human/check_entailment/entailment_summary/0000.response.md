Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. It calculates the space required for \(1 \times 1\) icons (\(space_x = x \times 1\)) and for \(2 \times 2\) icons (\(space_y = y \times 4\)).
3. It determines the number of screens needed for the \(2 \times 2\) icons, considering both even and odd values of \(y\).
4. It calculates the remaining space after placing all \(2 \times 2\) icons and checks if the remaining space is sufficient to fit all \(1 \times 1\) icons.
5. If not, it calculates additional screens needed for the remaining \(1 \times 1\) icons.
6. The logic seems to handle the placement of icons correctly according to the constraints provided.

Given the execution summary and the problem description, the program appears to be logically sound and should produce the correct results based on the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
