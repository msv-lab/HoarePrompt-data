Output State: **`remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0 (now `n - 1`), `result` is a list containing one element, either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1` which is just `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 8`, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `remaining_cells` to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `screen_require_for_y` depends on whether `y` is odd or even, but since the code does not change `y`, the value of `screen_require_for_y` remains as it was initially determined.
