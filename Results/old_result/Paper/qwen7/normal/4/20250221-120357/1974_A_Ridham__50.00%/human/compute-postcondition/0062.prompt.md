You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        space_x = x * 1
        
        space_y = y * 4
        
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if space_x % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = space_x // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `n` has been reduced to 0. At this point, `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `n` is 0. The `result` list contains all the elements added during each iteration of the loop, which can be either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` depending on the conditions met during each iteration. `space_x` and `space_y` are updated according to the last iteration's input values `x` and `y`, and `total_space` is the sum of `space_y` and `space_x`. `screen_require_for_y` is calculated as `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, and `extra_screen` is determined based on whether `space_x` is divisible by 15 or not.
    #
    #In summary, the final `result` list will contain up to `n` elements, each either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, with `t` and `n` adjusted accordingly, and `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, and `extra_screen` reflecting the last iteration's input values.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: \n'.join(map(str, result)) (where result is a list containing elements that are either screen_require_for_y or extra_screen + screen_require_for_y, with screen_require_for_y calculated as y // 2 if y is even, or y // 2 + 1 if y is odd, and extra_screen determined based on whether space_x is divisible by 15 or not)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
