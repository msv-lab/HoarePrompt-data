Output State: **`remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4` if `y` is odd, or `15 * (y // 2) - y * 4` if `y` is even; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0 (now `n - 1`); `result` is a list containing one element, either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`; `space_x` is equal to `x * 1` which is just `x`; `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`; `total_space` is equal to `y * 8`; `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `y // 2` to the variable `screen_require_for_y`. This does not affect any other variables. The initial conditions for `remaining_cells`, `t`, `n`, `result`, `space_x`, `space_y`, and `total_space` remain unchanged.
