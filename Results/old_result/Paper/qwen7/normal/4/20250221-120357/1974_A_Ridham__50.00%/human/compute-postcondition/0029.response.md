Output State: **`remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4` if `y` is odd, or `15 * (y // 2) - y * 4` if `y` is even; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0 (now `n - 1`); `result` is a list containing one element, either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`; `space_x` is equal to `x * 1` which is just `x`; `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`; `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`; `y` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The line `space_y = y * 4` simply reassigns the value of `space_y` to `y * 4`. Since `space_y` was already defined as `y * 4` in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged.
