Output State: **`remaining_cells` is updated to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1 (now `n - 1`), `result` is a list containing `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen + screen_require_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` depending on whether `y` is even or odd, `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, `result` now contains `screen_require_for_y`, and `space_y` is updated to `y * 4`.**

In this output state, the `result` list has been appended with `screen_require_for_y`, making it contain two elements. All other variables retain their initial conditions except for `result`, which now includes the new element.
