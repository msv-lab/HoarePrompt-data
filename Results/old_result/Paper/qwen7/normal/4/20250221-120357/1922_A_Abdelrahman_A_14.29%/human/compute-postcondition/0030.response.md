Postcondition: `c` must contain at least one element, and `x` will be the next element in `c`. If `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, then `no` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `x` is in `a` or `x` is in `b`, then no changes are made to `no` and the program continues as normal.
