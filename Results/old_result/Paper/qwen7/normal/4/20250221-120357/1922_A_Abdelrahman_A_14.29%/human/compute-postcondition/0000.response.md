Output State: **`tests` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `tests` ≤ 1000.**

Explanation: The code `tests = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `tests`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and the code does not affect any other variables, the output state remains that `tests` is an input integer within the same range.
