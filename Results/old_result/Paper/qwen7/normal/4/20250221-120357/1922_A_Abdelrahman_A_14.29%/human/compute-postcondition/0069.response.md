The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `tests`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `tests`. At the end of the last iteration, `tests` must be greater than 0, and `i` is equal to the length of the original `c` + 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `tests`. Since `i` is set to the length of the original `c` + 1, and `tests` must be greater than 0, for the loop to execute again, `tests` must be greater than the length of the original `c` + 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`tests` must be greater than the length of the original `c` + 1, `i` is equal to the length of the original `c` + 1**
