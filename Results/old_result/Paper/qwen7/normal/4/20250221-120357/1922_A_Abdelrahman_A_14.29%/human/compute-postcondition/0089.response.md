Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is an integer that is not present in either list `a` or `b`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('YES')
```

Here, the print statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`. The value of `x` being an integer not present in lists `a` or `b` does not affect this print statement.

Output: **YES**
