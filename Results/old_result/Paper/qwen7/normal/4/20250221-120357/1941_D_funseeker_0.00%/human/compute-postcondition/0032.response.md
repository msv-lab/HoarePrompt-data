Output State: **`r` is an integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`, `c` remains the same as its initial value, `q` is the first element in `ans`, `ans` now equals `temp`, and `temp` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The code initializes `temp` as an empty set. This does not affect the values of `r`, `c`, `q`, or `ans`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions, with `ans` being replaced by `temp`.
