Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for q in ans:`. The variables involved in this loop are `q` and `ans`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition:**
   - If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains elements where each element is either `(q + r) % n` or `(q - r) % n`.
   - If `c` is neither '1' nor '?', `temp` remains unchanged with elements where each element is `(q + r) % n`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - The variable `q` is being iterated over from the list `ans`.
   - The variable `c` is a condition that determines how `temp` is updated.
   - The variable `temp` is updated based on the value of `c` and the current value of `q`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `q` is being iterated over from `ans`, the value of `q` will change in each iteration.
   - The value of `c` does not change within the loop, so it remains as it was at the start of the loop.
   - The value of `temp` will be updated based on the value of `c` and the current value of `q`.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `c` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `q` changes to the next element in `ans`.
   - `temp` is updated based on the new value of `q` and the value of `c`.

Given the postcondition, if `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` will contain elements where each element is either `(q + r) % n` or `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is neither '1' nor '?', `temp` remains unchanged with elements where each element is `(q + r) % n`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote it as `q_prev`. For the next iteration, `q` will be the next element in `ans`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` contains elements where each element is either `(q_prev + r) % n` or `(q_prev - r) % n` (if `c` is '1' or '?'), or remains unchanged with elements where each element is `(q_prev + r) % n` (if `c` is neither '1' nor '?'), and `q` is the next element in `ans`.**
