Output State: **`ans` is a set containing the player `x`, `n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `m` is an integer representing the number of throws made (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), and `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n).**

The code initializes the set `ans` with the player `x`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged from their previous states.
