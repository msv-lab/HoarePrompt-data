Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and conditions**: The loop is defined as `for _ in range(m)`, which means it runs `m` times. The loop does not depend on any specific variable being checked within the loop itself; it simply iterates `m` times.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - All elements in `ans` have been processed.
   - `r` is an integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`.
   - `c` remains the same as its initial value.
   - `ans` now contains the results of adding and subtracting `r` modulo `n` for each element `q` in `temp`.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `range(m)`, the only thing that changes is the iteration count. The loop will run one more time if there are still iterations left.
   - `r` and `c` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop and their values are constant throughout the loop execution.
   - `ans` will be updated again in the next iteration, but since we are only asked to adjust the state at the start of the next iteration, we do not need to specify the contents of `ans` yet.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- The loop will run one more time, so we need to indicate that there is one iteration left.
- `r` remains the same.
- `c` remains the same.
- `ans` is not specified here as it will be updated in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`m` is decremented by 1, `r` is an integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`, `c` remains the same as its initial value, and `ans` has not yet been updated for this iteration.**
