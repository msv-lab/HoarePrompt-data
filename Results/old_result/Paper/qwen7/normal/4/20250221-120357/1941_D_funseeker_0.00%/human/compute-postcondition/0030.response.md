Output State: **`r` is the first part of the split result from `func_1()`, `c` remains the same as its initial value, `q` is the first element in `ans`, and `ans` now equals `temp`.**

Explanation: The code splits the result of `func_1()` into two parts and assigns them to `r` and `c`. However, since `c` was mentioned to remain the same as its initial value, it does not change. The other variables `q` and `ans` retain their previous states as described.
