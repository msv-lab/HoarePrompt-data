Output State: **`ans` contains all unique `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` values generated during the iterations, `c` is either '1' or '?', `m` has been decremented by the total number of iterations.**

Explanation: The line `ans = temp` assigns the value of `temp` to `ans`. This means that `ans` now holds all the unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` that were stored in `temp`. The values of `c` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
