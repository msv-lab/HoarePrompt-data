Postcondition: `r` is an integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`, `c` remains the same as its initial value, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `temp` contains the added value `(q + r) % n`, and this holds true whether `c` is '0', '?' or any other value since there is no else part that changes these conditions.
