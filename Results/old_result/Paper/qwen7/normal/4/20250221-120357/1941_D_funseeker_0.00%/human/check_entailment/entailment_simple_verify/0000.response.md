### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()`: Calls `func_1()` and converts the result to an integer.
   - `func_3()`: Calls `func_1()` and splits the result into a list of integers.
   - `func_4()`: Implements the main logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws.

2. **Main Logic in `func_4()`**:
   - **Initialization**: 
     - `n`, `m`, and `x` are read from the input.
     - A set `ans` is initialized with the starting player `x`.
   - **Loop through Throws**:
     - For each throw, the distance `r` and direction `c` are read.
     - If `c` is `'0'` or `'?'`, the ball can move `r` positions clockwise.
     - If `c` is `'1'` or `'?'`, the ball can move `r` positions counterclockwise.
     - The new possible positions are added to a temporary set `temp`.
   - **Update `ans`**:
     - After processing all throws, `ans` contains all possible positions.
     - If `0` is in `ans`, it is replaced with `n` to handle the circular nature of the players.
   - **Output**:
     - The size of `ans` is printed.
     - The elements of `ans` are printed in increasing order.

3. **Annotations and State Analysis**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The logic for handling `?` in both directions is correct.
   - The use of sets ensures efficient management of possible positions.
   - Modulo operations correctly handle the circular nature of the players.

Given the thorough handling of all specified cases and the examples provided, the program appears to be correct for all potential inputs. The logic correctly accounts for all possible directions and updates the set of possible positions accurately.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws. It handles both clockwise and counterclockwise throws appropriately using the `?` symbol to indicate uncertainty. The program uses sets to efficiently manage the possible positions of the ball and updates these sets based on the given distances and directions. Additionally, it correctly adjusts for the circular nature of the players by using modulo operations. Given the thorough handling of all specified cases and the examples provided, the program appears to be correct for all potential inputs.
