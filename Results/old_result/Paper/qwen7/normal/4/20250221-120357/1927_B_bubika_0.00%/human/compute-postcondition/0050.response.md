Output State: **`t` is 5, `r` is `r` + `a[x]`, `i` is the next element in the list `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `r += a[x]` increments the value of `r` by `a[x]`. However, since the initial value of `r` is not specified, it remains as `r + a[x]`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `x`) are not affected by this operation.
