Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `s`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `s`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `r` is 'aa'
   - `x` is undefined
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `s` is a list of integers with at least one element remaining
   - `b` is undefined
   - `i` is undefined
4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is undefined at the end of the previous iteration, it will be set to the first element of `s` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `s` will be the list `s` without its first element (since `i` will be the first element).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `r` remains 'aa'
- `x` remains undefined
- `n` remains an input integer
- `s` becomes a list of integers with at least one element removed from the beginning
- `b` remains undefined
- `i` becomes the first element of the original `s`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`r` is 'aa', `x` is undefined, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least one element removed from the beginning, `b` is undefined, `i` is the first element of the original `s`**
