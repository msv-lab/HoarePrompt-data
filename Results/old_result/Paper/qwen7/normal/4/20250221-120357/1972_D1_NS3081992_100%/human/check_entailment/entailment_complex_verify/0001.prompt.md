You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    #In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `k` will have been decreased by the difference between `m` and the value of each element in the list `a` that is less than `m`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of list `a` and decreases `k` by the difference between `m` and each element in `a` that is less than `m`. If `k` is greater than or equal to zero after the iteration, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6 and the product of n and m does not exceed 2 * 10^6.

    #
    #To understand this, let's break it down:
    #
    #- The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m` and `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`.
    #- After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
    #- The loop stops when `i` exceeds `m` or `i * i` exceeds `n + i`.
    #
    #Given that the loop runs until `i` reaches `m + 1` (since the condition `i <= m` must fail), and considering the increments, `i` will be `m + 1` at the end of the loop.
    #
    #The value of `ans` accumulates the result of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for each `i` starting from 2 up to `m`. This is because the loop starts with `i = 2` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, stopping just before `i` becomes `m + 1`.
    #
    #Thus, the final state of the loop is characterized by `i` being `m + 1`, and `ans` being the cumulative sum described above.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(m\), minus 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no parameters and returns the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(m\), minus 1.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute `func_10()` times. Since `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `func_10()` returns an integer within this range, the loop will execute between 1 and 10,000 times. Each iteration of the loop prints a positive integer returned by `func_15()`. Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations will consist of printing a positive integer from `func_15()` for each iteration, up to a maximum of 10,000 such integers.
    #
    #In natural language: The loop will print a sequence of positive integers, one per line, with the total number of integers printed being equal to the return value of `func_10()`, which is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It processes an integer `t` (where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)) and for each test case, it processes two integers `n` and `m` (where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\)). The function writes to the standard output a sequence of positive integers, one per line, with the total number of integers written being equal to the return value of `func_10()`, which is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Provided Functions
The provided functions are mostly utility functions for reading input, but they do not seem to be directly related to solving the main problem. We will focus on the function `func_16` which appears to be the main function handling the test cases.

### Function `func_16`
```python
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
```
- This function reads the number of test cases using `func_10` and then calls `func_15` for each test case.
- `func_15` is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\).

### Function `func_15`
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```
- This function reads \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_7`.
- It initializes `ans` to 0 and iterates through values of \(i\) from 1 up to \(m\) (or until \(i^2 > n + i\)).
- For each \(i\), it adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\) to `ans`.
- Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

### Correctness Analysis
To verify the correctness, we need to check if the logic in `func_15` correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

#### Key Insight
The key insight is that for a given \(i\), the number of valid \(a\) values is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\). This is because \(a + b = k \cdot (b \cdot \gcd(a, b))\) simplifies under certain conditions to count valid \(a\) values efficiently.

#### Verification
Let's verify this with the example provided in the problem statement:
- For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):
  - \(i = 1\): \(\left\lfloor \frac{10 + 1}{1^2} \right\rfloor = 11\)
  - \(i = 2\): \(\left\lfloor \frac{10 + 2}{2^2} \right\rfloor = 3\)
  - \(i = 3\): \(\left\lfloor \frac{10 + 3}{3^2} \right\rfloor = 1\)
  - \(i = 4\): \(\left\lfloor \frac{10 + 4}{4^2} \right\rfloor = 0\)
  - Total: \(11 + 3 + 1 = 15\)
  - Subtract 1: \(15 - 1 = 14\)

This matches the expected output for the given example.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the provided solution seems to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
