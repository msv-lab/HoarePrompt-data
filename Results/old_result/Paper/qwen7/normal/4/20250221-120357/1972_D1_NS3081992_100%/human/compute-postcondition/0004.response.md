Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(func_10())`. The only variables involved here are the loop variable `_` and the function call `func_10()`, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has executed once, meaning `func_10()` returned a positive integer.

3. **Determine the New State**:
   - The loop variable `_` is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs. Since it was used in the previous iteration, it is now at the next index.
   - The function `func_10()` returns a positive integer, and this value is printed. Let's denote this new value as `new_value`.

Given these points, we can update the state as follows:

- `t` remains unchanged since it was not part of the loop head.
- `_` (the loop variable) is now at the next index, so it is incremented by 1.
- The function `func_10()` will return a positive integer, and this value is printed. Therefore, we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer for the loop to continue.

So, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the function `func_10()` returns a positive integer and its value is printed, `_` is `k + 1`, and a positive integer from `func_15()` is printed.**
