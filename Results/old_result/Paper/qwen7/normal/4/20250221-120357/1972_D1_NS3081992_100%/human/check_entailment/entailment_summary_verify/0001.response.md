### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the provided solution correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Let's re-evaluate the solution step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Restatement
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Function `func_15`
The function `func_15` is designed to compute the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\). Here's the breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_7`, which reads space-separated integers.
2. **Initialization**: It initializes `ans` to 0 and sets `i` to 1.
3. **Loop**: It iterates through values of \(i\) from 1 up to \(m\) (or until \(i^2 > n + i\)).
4. **Counting Valid Pairs**: For each \(i\), it adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\) to `ans`.
5. **Return Value**: It returns `ans - 1`.

#### Key Insight
The key insight is that for a given \(i\), the number of valid \(a\) values is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\). This is because the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be simplified to count valid \(a\) values efficiently.

#### Verification
Let's verify this with the example provided in the problem statement:
- For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):
  - \(i = 1\): \(\left\lfloor \frac{10 + 1}{1^2} \right\rfloor = 11\)
  - \(i = 2\): \(\left\lfloor \frac{10 + 2}{2^2} \right\rfloor = 3\)
  - \(i = 3\): \(\left\lfloor \frac{10 + 3}{3^2} \right\rfloor = 1\)
  - \(i = 4\): \(\left\lfloor \frac{10 + 4}{4^2} \right\rfloor = 0\)
  - Total: \(11 + 3 + 1 = 15\)
  - Subtract 1: \(15 - 1 = 14\)

This matches the expected output for the given example.

#### Edge Cases
- **Large Values**: The function handles large values of \(n\) and \(m\) efficiently by iterating up to \(\sqrt{n + i}\), ensuring the loop runs in \(O(\sqrt{n})\) time complexity.
- **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles edge cases where \(i^2 > n + i\), stopping the loop early.

#### Overall Correctness
The function `func_15` correctly counts the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\). The main function `func_16` correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the results.

### Final Evaluation
Based on the detailed analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.

**Final: True**

The program is correct.
