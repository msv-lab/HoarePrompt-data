Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(func_10())`. The only variables involved here are the return value of `func_10()` and the loop counter `_`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `func_10()` returns a positive integer, and its value is printed.

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs for as many times as the return value of `func_10()`.
   - Since `func_10()` returns a positive integer, let's denote this return value as `k`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - After the previous iteration, the loop counter `_` would have incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, if the loop ran `k-1` times (since it starts from 0), then `_` would be `k-1` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be `k`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop head.
   - The return value of `func_10()` remains the same because the function is not re-evaluated within the loop.
   - The loop counter `_` needs to be updated to `k`.

Given that `func_10()` returns a positive integer `k`, and assuming `k` is the number of iterations the loop will perform, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); the function `func_10()` returns a positive integer and its value is printed, `_` is `k`**.
