Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); the function `func_15()` returns a positive integer and its value is printed.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` prints the result of calling the function `func_15()`. Since `func_15()` must return a positive integer, the value of `func_15()` is printed, but the actual value itself is not specified. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
