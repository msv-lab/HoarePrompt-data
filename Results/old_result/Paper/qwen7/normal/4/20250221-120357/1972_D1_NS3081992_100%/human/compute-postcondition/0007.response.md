Output State: The loop will execute exactly `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). During each iteration, the function `func_15()` will return a positive integer, which will be printed. Additionally, the variable `_` (which is used as a loop counter) will take on the values from 0 to \(t-1\) inclusive, and each of these values will be printed alongside the positive integer returned by `func_15()`. Therefore, the output will consist of `t` lines, each containing a positive integer from `func_15()` followed by the corresponding loop iteration number.
