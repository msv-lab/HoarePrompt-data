Reasoning:
1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling**: The program defines several functions, but the relevant ones for solving the problem are `func_10`, `func_15`, and `func_16`. `func_10` reads the number of test cases, `func_15` calculates the number of valid pairs for a given `n` and `m`, and `func_16` handles the overall process of reading inputs and printing outputs for each test case.
2. **Input Reading**: `func_10` correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`). `func_15` correctly reads `n` and `m` for each test case using `func_7`, which reads two space-separated integers from the input.
3. **Calculation of Valid Pairs**: `func_15` implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. This is done by iterating through possible values of `i` and calculating the number of valid pairs using the formula `(n + i) // (i * i)`.
4. **Output Printing**: `func_16` correctly calls `func_15` for each test case and prints the result, ensuring that the output format matches the required format.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
