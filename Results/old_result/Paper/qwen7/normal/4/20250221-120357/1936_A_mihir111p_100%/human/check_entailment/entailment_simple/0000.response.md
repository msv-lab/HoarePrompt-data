### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Each query compares the bitwise OR of two pairs of elements in the permutation \(p\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program iterates through the elements of the permutation to initialize some variables.
   - It uses a function `func_1` to make queries and compare the results.
   - The main logic seems to involve finding the maximum value of \(p_i \oplus p_j\) by comparing the bitwise OR of different pairs.

3. **Key Steps**:
   - **Initialization**: `ans1` is set to 0 initially.
   - **Finding Maximum OR**: For each element \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\), it makes a query to find the maximum bitwise OR with `ans1`.
   - **Finding Maximum XOR**: After identifying the candidate with the highest OR, it further narrows down the candidates to find the pair with the maximum XOR.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly prints the query and reads the response.
   - The responses are used to update the variables accordingly.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program attempts to find the maximum XOR by first identifying the element with the highest OR and then checking pairs of this element with others.
   - This approach is sound because the maximum XOR can often be found by considering the highest OR values, as the XOR of two numbers is maximized when their OR is high and they differ significantly in bits.

6. **Query Count**:
   - The program makes a total of approximately \(3n\) queries, which fits within the allowed limit.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum XOR pair using the allowed number of queries. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
