### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Conditions**: The program starts with reading the input and splitting it into a list of integers. The function `func_1` is then called with `n` (the number of containers) and `a` (the list of water amounts).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Total Water Calculation**: The total amount of water is calculated and stored in `total_water`.
   - **Divisibility Check**: The program checks if `total_water` is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'No', indicating that it's impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water.
   - **Target Amount**: If the divisibility check passes, the target amount of water per container (`target`) is calculated as `total_water // n`.
   - **Balance Calculation**: A variable `container` is used to keep track of the balance between the current total water and the target total water. This is done by iterating through the list `a` and adjusting `container` by adding the difference between each element and the target.
   - **Negative Balance Check**: During the iteration, if `container` becomes negative, it means that it's impossible to achieve the target distribution, and the function returns 'No'.
   - **Final Check**: If the loop completes without returning 'No', the function returns 'Yes', indicating that it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The logic correctly identifies if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers.
   - The balance calculation ensures that the distribution can be achieved if and only if the total amount of water can be evenly distributed among the containers.
   - The negative balance check ensures that if at any point the distribution becomes impossible, the function returns 'No' immediately.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

### Correctness:
**True**
