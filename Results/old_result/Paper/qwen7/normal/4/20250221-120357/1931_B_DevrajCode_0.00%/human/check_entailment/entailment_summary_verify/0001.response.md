### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers equal by pouring water from one container to another.
   - The key observation is that if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, then it's always possible to distribute the water evenly among the containers.

2. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the total amount of water is divisible by `n`.
   - It then iterates through each container and checks if the cumulative difference between the current container's water and the target amount is non-negative.
   - If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means it's impossible to achieve the target distribution, and the function returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'No', it means the distribution is possible, and the function returns 'Yes'.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the total water is not divisible by `n` by immediately returning 'No'.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the initial distribution is already even, returning 'Yes' without further checks.

4. **Input/Output Handling:**
   - The input reading and splitting logic is correct for multiple test cases.
   - The function call and output format match the problem requirements.

5. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the total water is divisible by `n` using `total_water % n == 0`.
   - It then calculates the target amount of water per container as `target = total_water // n`.
   - The function iterates through each container and maintains a cumulative difference `container` which represents the excess or deficit of water compared to the target.
   - If at any point `container` becomes negative, it means it's impossible to achieve the target distribution, and the function returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'No', it means the distribution is possible, and the function returns 'Yes'.

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The function correctly handles all edge cases and follows the logic to ensure that the water distribution is possible.
   - The implementation is consistent with the problem statement and the function summary.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. Therefore, the program is correct.
