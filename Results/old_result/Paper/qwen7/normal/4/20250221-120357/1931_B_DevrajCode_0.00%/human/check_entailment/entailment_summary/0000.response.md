Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the allowed operations.
2. The solution logic in `func_1` is correct for the problem statement:
   - It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`.
   - If not, it immediately returns 'No'.
   - If it is divisible, it calculates the target amount of water per container (`target = total_water // n`).
   - It then iterates through each container, adjusting the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount.
   - If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means it's impossible to redistribute the water without making some container have a negative amount of water, so it returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without finding any negative difference, it returns 'Yes'.

Given the logic aligns with the problem requirements and the provided execution summary, the function should correctly determine if it's possible to equalize the water in all containers.

Correctness: **True**
