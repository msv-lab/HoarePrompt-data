Postcondition: **`total_water` is equal to the sum of the integers in list `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `target` is `total_water // n`, `container` is adjusted based on whether it is less than 0, and `water` is the next element in the list `a`. If `container` is less than 0, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, no specific change is made to `container`.**
