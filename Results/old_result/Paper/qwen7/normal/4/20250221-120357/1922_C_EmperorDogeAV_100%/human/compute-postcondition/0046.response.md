Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]`, and `forward` is either `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1` or remains `999999999999999999` if `i` is not less than `n - 1`. Additionally, if `abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back)`, then `prog_cities[i]` is set to `1`; otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`.
