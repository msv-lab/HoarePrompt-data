Output State: **`cities` is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line in strictly increasing order, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes `prog_cities` as a list of `n-1` zeros. The list `cities` and the variable `n` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `prog_cities` is updated to a list of `n-1` zeros, while `cities` and `n` retain their initial conditions.
