### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Purpose**: The function aims to determine the smallest absolute difference between the coordinate of each city and its nearest neighbor.
2. **Logic**:
   - For each city (except the first and last), it calculates the distance to the next and previous cities.
   - If the distance to the next city is smaller, it assigns that distance to `prog_cities[i]`.
   - Otherwise, it assigns the distance to the previous city.
   - The first and last elements of `prog_cities` are set to 0 because they don't have a previous or next city, respectively.

Given the problem description, the function should identify the closest city for each city. However, the current implementation only calculates the distance to the next and previous cities and chooses the smaller distance, which does not necessarily give the correct closest city. This is evident from the example provided in the original assessment.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the cities located in points `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`.

- For city 1 (at position 0):
  - Distance to next city (city 2): \(|8 - 0| = 8\)
  - Distance to previous city (not applicable): 0
  - Incorrectly chosen: 0 (should be 8)

- For city 2 (at position 1):
  - Distance to next city (city 3): \(|12 - 8| = 4\)
  - Distance to previous city (city 1): \(|8 - 0| = 8\)
  - Correctly chosen: 4

- For city 3 (at position 2):
  - Distance to next city (city 4): \(|15 - 12| = 3\)
  - Distance to previous city (city 2): \(|12 - 8| = 4\)
  - Correctly chosen: 3

- For city 4 (at position 3):
  - Distance to next city (city 5): \(|20 - 15| = 5\)
  - Distance to previous city (city 3): \(|15 - 12| = 3\)
  - Incorrectly chosen: 5 (should be 3)

- For city 5 (at position 4):
  - Distance to next city (not applicable): 0
  - Distance to previous city (city 4): \(|20 - 15| = 5\)
  - Incorrectly chosen: 0 (should be 5)

From this analysis, we see that `func_1` does not correctly identify the closest city for each city, leading to incorrect results.

#### Main Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The main program reads the input and processes the cities.
2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - It uses the results from `func_1` to calculate prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) for forward and backward travel.
   - For each query, it determines the minimum cost to travel from one city to another using the prefix sums.

Given that `func_1` does not correctly identify the closest city, the main program will also produce incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the closest city for each city, leading to incorrect results.

**Final: False**
