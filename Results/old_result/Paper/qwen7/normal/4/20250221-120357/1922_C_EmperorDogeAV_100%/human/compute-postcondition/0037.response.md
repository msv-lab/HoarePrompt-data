Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `back` is `cities[i - 1]`, `forward` is `999999999999999999`**

Explanation: The variable `back` is assigned the value of `cities[i - 1]`. The value of `i` is `i + 1` from the initial state, but since the code does not modify `i`, it remains `i + 1`. The value of `forward` remains unchanged at `999999999999999999`.
