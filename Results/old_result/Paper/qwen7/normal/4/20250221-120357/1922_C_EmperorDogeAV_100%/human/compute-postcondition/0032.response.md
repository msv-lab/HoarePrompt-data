Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `back` is updated to `cities[i - 1]`, `forward` is either `cities[i + 1]` (if `i < n - 1`) or remains `999999999999999999` (if `i >= n - 1`). Additionally, `prog_cities[i]` is set to the minimum value between the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` and the value previously set to `1` in the if part.
