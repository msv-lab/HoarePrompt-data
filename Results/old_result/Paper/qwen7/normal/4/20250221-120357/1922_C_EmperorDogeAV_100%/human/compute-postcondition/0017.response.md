Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `back` is the value of `cities[i - 1]`, and `forward` is the value of `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`. Otherwise, `back` remains unchanged. The absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`.
