### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues with the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest City**:
   - The `func_1` function aims to determine the closest city for each city based on the smallest absolute difference between the current city's coordinate and its neighbors' coordinates. However, the logic implemented in `func_1` does not correctly identify the closest city.
   - Specifically, the function checks the distance to the next and previous cities and assigns the smaller distance to `prog_cities[i]`. This approach does not guarantee that the assigned city is indeed the closest city according to the problem's definition.
   - As illustrated in the example provided:
     - For city 1, the distances to the next and previous cities are `8` and `0`, respectively. The function would choose `0`, which is incorrect because the closest city is actually city 2.
     - For city 3, the distances to the next and previous cities are `15 - 12 = 3` and `12 - 8 = 4`, respectively. The function would choose `3`, which is correct, but for city 4, the distances are `20 - 15 = 5` and `15 - 12 = 3`, and the function would choose `5`, which is incorrect because the closest city is city 3.

2. **Incorrect Usage of `prog_cities`**:
   - The `prog_cities` array is used to store the smallest absolute differences, but it is not correctly interpreted in the context of finding the closest city. The values in `prog_cities` do not directly represent the closest city but rather the smallest distance to the next or previous city.
   - The program then uses `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` to calculate the prefix sums of `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`, respectively. These prefix sums are used to determine the minimum cost of travel between two cities, but they are based on incorrect assumptions about the closest cities.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Queries**:
   - The program assumes that the prefix sums can be used to determine the minimum cost of travel between two cities by simply subtracting the appropriate prefix sums. However, this assumption is flawed because the `prog_cities` array does not correctly identify the closest cities.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the closest city for each city, and therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the closest city for each city, leading to incorrect results for the queries.
