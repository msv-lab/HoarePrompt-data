Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]`, `forward` is either `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1` or remains `999999999999999999` if `i` is not less than `n - 1`, and `prog_cities[i]` is the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`.**

This means that after executing the line of code, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, `back` is now set to the value of `cities[i - 1]`, and `forward` is either the value of `cities[i + 1]` if `i` is less than `n - 1`, or remains `999999999999999999` if `i` is not less than `n - 1`. Additionally, `prog_cities[i]` is updated to store the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`.
