Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `back` is `-99999999999999999999`, `forward` is `999999999999999999`**.

Explanation: The code snippet sets the value of `forward` to `999999999999999999`. This does not affect the values of `i` and `back`. The initial state of `forward` was dependent on the condition `i < n - 1` or `i >= n - 1`, but since the value is now explicitly set to `999999999999999999`, this new value is used. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
