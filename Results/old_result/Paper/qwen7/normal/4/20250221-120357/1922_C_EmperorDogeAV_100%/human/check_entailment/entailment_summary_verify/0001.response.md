### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves finding the minimum cost to travel between two cities on a number line, where the cost depends on the closest city to the current city. The closest city is defined as the city with the smallest distance to the current city among all cities.

2. **Key Components of the Solution**:
   - **Cities Array**: The array `cities` stores the coordinates of the cities.
   - **Forward and Backward Cities**: The function `func_1` calculates an array `prog_cities` indicating whether the next city is closer than the previous one. This helps in determining the direction of movement.
   - **Prefix Sums**: Two prefix sum arrays `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are used to store cumulative distances for forward and backward movements.
   - **Query Handling**: For each query, the code determines the minimum cost based on the prefix sums.

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - **Input Parsing**: The code correctly parses the input for the number of test cases, cities, and queries.
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly identifies the closest city for each city by comparing distances to the next and previous cities. However, there is a logical error in how the closest city is determined. Specifically, the condition should check if moving forward is closer than moving backward, not just checking the absolute difference.
   - **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sums are calculated correctly, but they are only used for forward movements. For backward movements, the prefix sums are reversed, which is correct.
   - **Query Processing**: The code processes each query correctly by using the appropriate prefix sum array based on the direction of travel.

4. **Identifying the Error**:
   - The main issue lies in the function `func_1`. The logic for determining the closest city is flawed. The current implementation checks if the forward city is closer in terms of absolute difference, which is incorrect. It should check if moving forward results in a smaller distance compared to the backward city.

5. **Correcting the Logic**:
   - The function should update `prog_cities[i]` to 1 if moving forward results in a smaller distance than moving backward.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the identified error in the `func_1` function, the overall solution is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the closest city for each city.

However, upon closer inspection, the provided function `func_1` actually does determine the closest city correctly. Here's why:

- The function `func_1` iterates through each city and compares the distance to the next and previous cities.
- If the distance to the next city is smaller than the distance to the previous city, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1, indicating that the next city is closer.
- Otherwise, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the distance to the next city, indicating that moving forward is not closer.

This logic ensures that `prog_cities[i]` correctly indicates the closest city for each city. Therefore, the function `func_1` is correct.

Given this, the rest of the code also appears to be correct. The prefix sum calculations and query handling are appropriately implemented.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
