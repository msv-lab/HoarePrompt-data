Output State: **`queue` now contains the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and the previous tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` was appended to it, `current` is the next neighbor from `tree[current]` that is not in the `visited` set, `neighbor` is added to the `visited` set, `visited` now includes the element `neighbor`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. All other variables remain unchanged. The `visited` set already included the `neighbor`, and now it still includes it. The `queue` now contains the previously existing tuples plus the newly appended tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`.
