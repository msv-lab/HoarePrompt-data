You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, and target is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree. The variable tree is an adjacency list representation of the tree where tree[node] is a list of integers representing the neighbors of node.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: Output State: The `queue` is an empty deque, `current` is the last node that was dequeued from the `queue` and processed, `dist` is the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `current` node, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited during the traversal.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `queue` will be empty because all reachable nodes have been processed. `Current` will be the last node visited, and `visited` will include all nodes that can be reached from the `start` node along with their respective distances stored in `dist`. If the `target` node was found during the traversal, `dist` will hold the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `target` node. Otherwise, `dist` will represent the shortest distance from the `start` node to the farthest node reachable from the `start` node.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, where `start` is an integer representing the starting node and `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree. The function returns 0 if the target is not found, the distance from the start node to the current node when dequeued from the queue, the distance which was the second element of the tuple dequeued from the queue, or -1 if an error occurs.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the distance `dist` from the `start` node to the `current` node that was dequeued from the `queue`.

Case_3: The program returns the distance 'dist' which was the second element of the tuple that was dequeued from the queue.

Case_4: The program returns -1


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
