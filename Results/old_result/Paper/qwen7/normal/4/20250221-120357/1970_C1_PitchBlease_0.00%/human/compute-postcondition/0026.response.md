The loop head contains the variable `queue`. Therefore, the only state that can be adjusted is the `queue`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `queue` must not be empty. After the previous iteration, the `queue` contains tuples of the form `(neighbor, dist + 1)` for each unvisited neighbor of the current node.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the `queue` must still contain at least one tuple. This means the `queue` cannot be empty.

State: **The `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form (neighbor, dist + 1) for each unvisited neighbor of the current node, `current` is the last unvisited neighbor of the current node that was dequeued, `dist` is the distance from the `start` node to the `current` node, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited during the traversal, including the `start` node and all unvisited neighbors of `current`, and the `queue` must not be empty.**
