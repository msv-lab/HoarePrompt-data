Output State: **`queue` now contains the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `current` is the new neighbor from `tree[current]` that is not in the `visited` set, the `neighbor` is now in the `visited` set, and `visited.add(neighbor)` has been executed.**

This means that the `neighbor` has been added to the `visited` set, and the other conditions remain unchanged. The `queue` still contains the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `current` is still the new neighbor from `tree[current]` that is not in the `visited` set, and the `neighbor` is now confirmed to be in the `visited` set.
