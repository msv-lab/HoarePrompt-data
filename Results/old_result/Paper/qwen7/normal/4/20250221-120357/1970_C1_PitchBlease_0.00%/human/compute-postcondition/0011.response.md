Postcondition: `queue` is a deque containing the tuple that was second in the original queue, `current` is the integer from the tuple that was dequeued (originally the `start`), `dist` is 0, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start` and the `current` node, `current` has at least one unvisited neighbor, and the neighbor of `current` that satisfies the condition `(neighbor not in visited)` is now part of the `visited` set.
