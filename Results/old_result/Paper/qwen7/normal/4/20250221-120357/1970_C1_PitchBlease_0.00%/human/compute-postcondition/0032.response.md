Output State: **`queue` is a deque without its first element, `current` is the neighbor that was dequeued from the `queue`, `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor, and the `neighbor` is now in the `visited` set.**

Explanation: The code `visited.add(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` to the `visited` set. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `neighbor` is not in the `visited` set is no longer valid since it has been added to the `visited` set.
