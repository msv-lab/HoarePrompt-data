Output State: The `queue` is an empty deque, indicating that all nodes that can be reached from the starting node have been processed. The `current` node is the last node that was dequeued and processed, and `dist` is the shortest distance from the starting node to the `current` node. The `visited` set contains all nodes that have been explored during the traversal, and the `target` node is either included in the `visited` set if it was reached, or it remains as one of the leaves of the tree if it was not found during the traversal.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the `queue` is empty because all nodes have been processed. The `current` node is the last node visited, and `dist` represents the shortest path distance from the starting node to the `current` node. The `visited` set includes all nodes that were explored, and the `target` node is either part of the `visited` set if it was reached or remains as one of the leaves of the tree if it was not found.
