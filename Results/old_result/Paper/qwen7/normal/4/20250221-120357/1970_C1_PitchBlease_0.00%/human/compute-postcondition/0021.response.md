Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing the tuple (`neighbor`, `dist + 1`), `current` is the next unvisited neighbor of the original current node, `dist` is 0, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start`, `current`, `neighbor`, and `neighbor` is added to `visited`.**

Explanation: The line `visited.add(neighbor)` adds the variable `neighbor` to the set `visited`. Since `neighbor` was already part of the set before this operation (as per the initial state), adding it again does not change the set. All other variables remain unchanged.
