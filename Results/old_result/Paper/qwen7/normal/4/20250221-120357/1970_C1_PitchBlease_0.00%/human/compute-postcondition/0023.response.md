Postcondition: **`queue` is a deque containing the tuple (`neighbor`, `dist + 1`), `current` is the next unvisited neighbor of the original current node, `dist` is 1, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start`, `current`, and `neighbor`, and `neighbor` is added to `visited`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes. If the condition `neighbor not in visited` is true, the queue and other variables are updated as specified in the if part. Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly reflects the changes made in the if part.
