Output State: The `queue` contains tuples of all neighbors of the nodes that are yet to be visited, with each tuple consisting of the neighbor node and the distance from the `start` node to that neighbor. The `current` node is the last node that was dequeued from the `queue`, and it has been processed. All nodes that have been visited are stored in the `visited` set. The `dist` variable holds the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `current` node.

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop, the `queue` will be empty because all nodes reachable from the start node have been processed. The `current` node will be the last node that was dequeued from the `queue`, and it will have been fully explored. The `visited` set will contain all nodes that can be reached from the start node, and the `dist` will hold the shortest path distance to the farthest node from the start node that has been visited.
