Postcondition: **`queue` is a deque containing the tuple (neighbor, dist + 1), `current` is the integer from the tuple that was dequeued (originally the `start`), `dist` is 0, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start`, `current`, and `neighbor`, and `current` has at least one unvisited neighbor.**

This postcondition describes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the neighbor is not in the visited set, the tuple (neighbor, dist + 1) is added to the queue, and the neighbor is marked as visited. The current node remains unchanged, and the distance (`dist`) is incremented by 1. If the neighbor is already in the visited set, no changes are made to the queue or the visited set.
