Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `i` is `i + 1`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `t2` as `(a[i] + 2) % n`. Since `i` was previously updated to `i + 1`, the new value of `i` is used in the calculation of `t2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
