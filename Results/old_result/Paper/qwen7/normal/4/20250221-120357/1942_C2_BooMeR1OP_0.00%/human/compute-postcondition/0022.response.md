Output State: **`ans` is increased by 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`, and `x` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet `t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n` does not change the values of `ans`, `i`, `t1`, or `x`. It only updates the value of `t2` based on the current value of `a[i]`, which is already part of the calculation for `t2`. Therefore, the values of `ans`, `i`, `t1`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
