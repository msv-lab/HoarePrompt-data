Output State: **`gaps` is a sorted list of all positive `gap` values that were greater than 0 during the iterations, and must not be empty, `ans` is equal to the total number of iterations `x` plus 2 times `y`, `i` is equal to `x`, `pairs` is equal to `gap // 2`, and `y` is less than `gap // 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are modified within the statement itself, the values of `gaps`, `ans`, `i`, `pairs`, and `y` remain unchanged. The only effect is that the program breaks out of the loop or conditional block it was in.
