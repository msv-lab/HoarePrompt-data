Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `gaps` is a sorted list of all positive `gap` values that were greater than 0 during the iterations, `ans` is equal to the total number of iterations `x`, and `i` is equal to `x`.
Code of the loop:
for gap in gaps:
    pairs = gap // 2
    if y >= pairs:
        ans += gap
        y -= pairs
    else:
        ans += 2 * y
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `gaps` is a sorted list of all positive `gap` values that were greater than 0 during the iterations, and must not be empty, `ans` is equal to the total number of iterations `x` plus either `gap` (if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs - gap // 2`) or `2 * y` (if `y` is less than `gap // 2`), `i` is equal to `x`, and `pairs` is equal to `gap // 2

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `gaps` is a sorted list of all positive `gap` values that were greater than 0 during the iterations, `ans` is equal to the total number of iterations `x` plus either `gap` (if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs - gap // 2`) or `4 * y` (if `y` is less than `gap // 2`), `i` is equal to `x`, `pairs` is now equal to `gap // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `gaps` is a sorted list of all positive `gap` values that were greater than 0 during the iterations, `ans` is equal to the total number of iterations `x` plus either `gap` (if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs - gap // 2`) or `4 * y` (if `y` is less than `gap // 2`) plus an additional `gap` or `2 * y` depending on the value of `y`, `i` is equal to `x`, `pairs` is now equal to `gap // 2`, and the program either decreases `y` by `pairs` or breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
