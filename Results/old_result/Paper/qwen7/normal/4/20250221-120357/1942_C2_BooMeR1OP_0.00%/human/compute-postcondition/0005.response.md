Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `a` is a list where elements are sorted in ascending order, `present` is a set containing the elements of the list `a`, `ans` is x - 2.**

The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `x - 2`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
