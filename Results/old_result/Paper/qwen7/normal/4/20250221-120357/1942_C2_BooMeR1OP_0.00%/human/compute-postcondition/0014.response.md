The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `x`. At the end of the last iteration, the postcondition tells us that `ans` is increased by 1, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, and `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`. The loop will continue if `i` is less than `x`.

Given that the loop condition is `i < x`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`. Since `x` does not change within the loop, `x` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect `i` being incremented by 1, while `x` remains unchanged.

State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `x` is the same**
