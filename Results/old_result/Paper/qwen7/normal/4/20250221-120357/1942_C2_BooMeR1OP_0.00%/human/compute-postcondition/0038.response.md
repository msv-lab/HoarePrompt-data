Output State: **`gaps` is `[gap]` appended with `gap`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 3, `next_elem` is `a[3] + (n if 1 == x - 1 else 0)`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[2] - 1`**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `gap` to the list `gaps`. Since `gaps` was initially `[gap]` if `gap > 0`, or an empty list otherwise, appending `gap` to `gaps` means `gaps` now contains `[gap, gap]` if `gap > 0`, or just `[gap]` if `gap` was already in the list. The other variables (`ans`, `i`, `next_elem`, and `gap`) remain unchanged.
