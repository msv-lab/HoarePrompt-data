Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `a` is a list where elements are sorted in ascending order, `present` is a set containing the elements of the list `a`, `ans` is x - 2.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
    t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
    if t1 not in present and t2 in present:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` is increased by 1, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, and `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`. If `t1` is not in `present` and `t2` is in `present`, `ans` is incremented by 1. There is no else part in the code, so no additional changes occur in other scenarios.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is increased by 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, and `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`, provided that `t1` is not in `present` and `t2` is in `present`. If the condition `t1 not in present and t2 in present` is not met, the values of `ans`, `i`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is increased by 3, `i` is incremented by 1, and both `t1` and `t2` are in the `present` set if `t1` is not in `present` and `t2` is in `present`. If the condition `t1 not in present and t2 in present` is true, then `ans` is increased by 3 and `i` is incremented by 1. If the condition is false, the values of `ans` and `i` remain as they were before the if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
