Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, and we have read three integers from the input to assign them to `n`, `x`, and `y`.**

In this output state, the variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and was not affected by the code. The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values read from the input, which satisfy the given constraints.
