Output State: **`gaps` is a sorted list of all positive `gap` values that were greater than 0 during the iterations, `ans` is equal to the total number of iterations `x` plus either `gap` (if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs - gap // 2`) or `2 * y` plus the current `gap` (if `y` is less than `gap // 2`), `i` is equal to `x`, `pairs` is now equal to `gap // 2`, `y` is decreased by `pairs`.**

Explanation: The code `y -= pairs` decreases the value of `y` by the value of `pairs`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
