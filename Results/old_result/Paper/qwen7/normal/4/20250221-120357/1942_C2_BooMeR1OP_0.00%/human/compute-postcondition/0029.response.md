Output State: **`gaps` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `next_elem` is `a[(0 + 1) % x] + (n if 0 == x - 1 else 0)`**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `next_elem` based on the given formula. Since `i` is 0 and `x` is a positive integer, the expression simplifies to `a[1 % x] + (n if 0 == x - 1 else 0)`. However, without knowing the exact value of `x`, we cannot simplify further. The other variables (`gaps`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
