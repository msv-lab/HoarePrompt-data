Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `gaps` is `[gap]` if `gap > 0`, otherwise it remains an empty list.
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `next_elem` is `a[1] + (n if 0 == x - 1 else 0)`.
   - `gap` is `next_elem - a[0] - 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < x`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, after the first iteration, `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be updated to `1`.
   - `next_elem` and `gap` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 1.
- `next_elem` and `gap` will be recalculated but their exact values depend on the loop body, which is omitted here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`gaps` is `[gap]` if `gap > 0`, otherwise `gaps` remains an empty list. `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `next_elem` is `a[1] + (n if 0 == x - 1 else 0)`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[0] - 1`**.
