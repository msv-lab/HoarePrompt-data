Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a list of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t, integers n, x, and y, and a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n. It returns a value based on the conditions specified for n, x, and y.**

This means the function `func_1` indirectly accepts a series of test cases, each containing a positive integer `t`, three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The function processes these inputs according to the given constraints and returns a value based on the conditions provided for `n`, `x`, and `y`.
