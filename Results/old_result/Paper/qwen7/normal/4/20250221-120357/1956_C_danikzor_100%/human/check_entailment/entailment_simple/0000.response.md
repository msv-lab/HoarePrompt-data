Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations, where each operation is either permuting the rows or columns.
2. The provided code attempts to solve this by performing two operations for each row, one for the row itself and one for the corresponding column. Specifically, it prints out the maximum possible sum and the number of operations required, which is \( 2n \).
3. The formula used to calculate the maximum sum \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \) seems to be derived from the sum of permutations of the numbers from 1 to \( n \). This formula is correct for the sum of all elements in the matrix after the specified operations.
4. The code correctly performs the required operations for each row, first permuting the row in descending order and then permuting the corresponding column in descending order.
5. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution meets the requirements and produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
