Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The formula used to calculate the maximum sum \(s\) and the number of operations is incorrect. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the matrix elements by performing at most \(2n\) operations, where each operation involves either permuting rows or columns. However, the given solution attempts to fill the matrix in a way that does not necessarily maximize the sum and uses an incorrect formula for calculating the sum.

The correct approach would involve setting the diagonal elements to the highest possible values using the allowed operations. Given the constraints, the optimal strategy is to set the diagonal elements to \(n, n-1, \ldots, 1\) and ensure the rest of the matrix is filled in a way that maximizes the sum without exceeding the operation limit. The provided solution does not achieve this and hence is incorrect.
