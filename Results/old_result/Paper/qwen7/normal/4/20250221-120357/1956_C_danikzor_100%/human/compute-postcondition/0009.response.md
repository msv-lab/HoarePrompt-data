Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` must be at least 3, but its exact value is not specified. However, since it's used in the `range` function with `n, 0, -1`, it must be greater than 0.

The `range(n, 0, -1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from `n` down to 1 (since it stops just before 0). For example, if `n` were 3, the range would generate `[3, 2, 1]`.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output:

- The number `1`
- The value of `i`, which is `3`
- All the numbers generated by `range(n, 0, -1)`

Given that `n` must be at least 3, let's assume the minimum value for `n` to illustrate the output:

Output: **1 3 3 2 1**
