Output State: `x` is equal to the length of the `nums` list, and `start_year` is the result of applying the operation `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each `x` in the range from 0 to the length of the `nums` list minus one, with `x` taking on each value in that range in sequence, and `x` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list after all iterations have completed.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `x` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list, and `start_year` will be the final value obtained by successively applying the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each index `x` from 0 to the length of the `nums` list minus one. The variable `x` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list after all iterations have completed.
