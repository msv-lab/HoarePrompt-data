Output State: **`x` is equal to the length of the `nums` list, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input, `start_year` is 0, and `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `start_year = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `start_year`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
