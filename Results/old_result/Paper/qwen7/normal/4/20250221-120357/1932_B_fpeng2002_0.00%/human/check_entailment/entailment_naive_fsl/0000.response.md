Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. Specifically, the logic inside the loop to calculate `start_year` is flawed. 

The program calculates `start_year` using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which does not correctly find the next multiple of `nums[x]` after `start_year`. Instead, it should find the least common multiple (LCM) of all previous periods and then add the current period's offset.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  3 2 4
  ```

- Expected Output:
  - The first sign occurs in year 3.
  - The second sign occurs in year 4 (since the first sign occurred in year 3, we start counting from year 4).
  - The third sign occurs in year 12 (since the second sign occurred in year 4, we start counting from year 5, and the LCM of 3 and 2 is 6, plus the offset of 4 gives us 10, and the LCM of 6 and 4 is 12).

- Actual Output:
  - The program incorrectly calculates the year as 6 instead of 12.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle the sequential occurrence of signs and does not find the correct year for the apocalypse.
