Output State: **`num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, 1 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 1000, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.**

Explanation: The code decrements `num_tests` by 1. Since `num_tests` was initially an input integer within the range [1, 1000], after decrementing, `num_tests` will now be one less than its original value but still within the same range. All other variables (`t`, `n`, and the list `a`) remain unchanged.
