Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in range(0, len(nums))`. The variables involved here are `x` and `len(nums)`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `x` is 1
   - `len(nums)` is the length of the `nums` list
   - `start_year` is (((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1])

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `x` is less than `len(nums)`. Since `x` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will continue until `x` reaches `len(nums)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `x` will be incremented by 1, so at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be 2.
   - `len(nums)` remains unchanged because it is the length of the `nums` list, which does not change within the loop.
   - `start_year` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head and its value is determined outside the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`x` is 2, `len(nums)` is the length of the `nums` list, `start_year` is (((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1])**
