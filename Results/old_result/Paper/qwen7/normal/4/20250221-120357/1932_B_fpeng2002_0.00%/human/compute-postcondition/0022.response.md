Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `x`. The loop runs from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is 0
   - `len(nums)` is the length of the `nums` list
   - `start_year` is calculated as `(((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0])`

3. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `x` should be 1.
   - The value of `len(nums)` remains the same because it is the length of the `nums` list, which does not change within the loop.
   - The value of `start_year` does not change based on the loop itself; it is only updated outside the loop or remains constant unless explicitly changed inside the loop.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `x`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is 1, `len(nums)` is the length of the `nums` list, and `start_year` is (((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0])**
