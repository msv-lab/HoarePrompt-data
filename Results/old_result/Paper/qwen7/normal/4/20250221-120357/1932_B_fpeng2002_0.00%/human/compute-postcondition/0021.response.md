Output State: **`x` is 0, `len(nums)` is the length of the `nums` list, and `start_year` is (((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0])**.

Explanation: The variable `x` is initially set to 0, and the list `nums` is obtained from user input. The code updates the value of `start_year` to (((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]). Since `x` is 0, the code uses the first element of the `nums` list, which is `nums[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
