Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned from the input split by spaces.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even.
   - `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
   - `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1` is smaller than `p3 - p2`, otherwise `low` is `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the opposite of `low`.
   - `cur` is equal to `low`.
   - `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.

2. **Determine the Value of `cur`**:
   - Since `cur` is equal to `low`, we need to determine the value of `low`.
   - `low` is defined as `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1` is smaller than `p3 - p2`, otherwise `low` is `p3 - p2`.

3. **Evaluate the Condition for `low`**:
   - We need to compare `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` to determine `low`.
   - If `p3 - p1 < p3 - p2`, then `low = p3 - p1`.
   - Otherwise, `low = p3 - p2`.

4. **Evaluate the Final Expression**:
   - The expression to be evaluated is `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - Since `cur = low`, we substitute `low` into the expression.
   - Therefore, the expression becomes `p1 - (p3 - p1) + p3`.

5. **Simplify the Expression**:
   - Simplify the expression: `p1 - (p3 - p1) + p3 = p1 - p3 + p1 + p3 = 2 * p1`.

Given the above steps, the final expression simplifies to `2 * p1`.

Output: **2 * p1**
