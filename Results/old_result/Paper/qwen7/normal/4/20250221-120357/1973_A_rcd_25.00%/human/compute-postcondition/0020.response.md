Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1` is smaller than `p3 - p2`, otherwise `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is the opposite of `low`, `cur` is equal to `low`, `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, we break out of the loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. It simply indicates that the program would exit the current loop or conditional block. All the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as the initial state.
