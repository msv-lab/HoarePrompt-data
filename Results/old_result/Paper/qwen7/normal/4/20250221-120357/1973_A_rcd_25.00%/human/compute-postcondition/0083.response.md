Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split.
- The program continues the loop or block of code if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.

The `print(p1 + p2)` statement will print the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Since the exact values of `p1` and `p2` are not specified, we cannot determine their exact sum. However, we know that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` must be odd for the program to continue executing this block of code.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are integers from the input split)**
