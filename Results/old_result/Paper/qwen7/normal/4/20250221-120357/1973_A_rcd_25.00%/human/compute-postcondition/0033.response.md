To determine what will be printed, let's break down the expression `p1 - cur + p3`.

1. **p1**: This variable is explicitly mentioned but its value is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its exact value without additional information.

2. **cur**: Similarly, this variable is also explicitly mentioned but its value is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its exact value without additional information.

3. **p3**: This variable is explicitly mentioned but its value is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its exact value without additional information.

Given that none of the variables (`p1`, `cur`, `p3`) have explicit values provided in the initial state, we can only describe the expression in terms of these variables.

Output: **p1 - cur + p3**
