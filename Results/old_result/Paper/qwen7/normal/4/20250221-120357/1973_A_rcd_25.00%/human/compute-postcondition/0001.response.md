State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive**.

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `t` as the control variable for the `range(t)` function.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` requires a non-negative integer argument.
- The initial value of `t` being an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive ensures that the loop will run the specified number of times.
- No other variables or states need to be adjusted since they are not part of the loop head.
