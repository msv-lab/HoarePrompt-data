Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is equal to `low`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `low` to the variable `cur`. Since `low` was previously defined as the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, the value of `cur` now reflects this same calculation. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
