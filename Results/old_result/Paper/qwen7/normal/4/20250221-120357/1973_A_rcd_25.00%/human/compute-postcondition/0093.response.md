Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is equal to `low + 1`, and `(p1 - (cur - 1) > p2 - (p3 - (cur - 1)))**.

Explanation: The variable `cur` is incremented by 1. Initially, `cur` was equal to `low`. After incrementing `cur` by 1, `cur` now equals `low + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
