Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is the variable `t`, which controls the number of iterations.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
   - For the loop to continue, `t` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop continues if `t` is greater than 0, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `t - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive**.

This adjustment ensures that the loop continues to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
