Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 1`. If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then `cur` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1.
