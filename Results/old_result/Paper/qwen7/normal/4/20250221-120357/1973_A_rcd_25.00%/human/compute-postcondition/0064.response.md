`cur` is incremented by 1, which means `cur` now holds the value of its original value plus 1. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 1`; `cur` is the original value of `cur` plus 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 1`; `cur` is the original value of `cur` plus 1.**
