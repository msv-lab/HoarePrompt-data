Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the expression `range(int(input()))`. This means the loop will run for as many times as the integer input from the user.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is 140
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
   - `n` must be greater than 2
   - `i` is equal to 0

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - The loop will execute one more time if the input integer is greater than 0 (since `range(int(input()))` will generate a sequence starting from 0 up to but not including the input value).
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will execute one more time if the input integer is greater than 0.
   - After the loop executes one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1.

Given these points, we need to update the state accordingly:

- `res` remains unchanged at 140.
- `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` must still be greater than 2.
- `i` will be updated to 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`res` is 140, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is equal to 1**.
