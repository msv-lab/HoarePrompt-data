Output State: **`total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 6, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 39, `n` must be greater than 5**

Explanation: The value of `i` is updated to `i + 1`, which means `i` becomes 6. The value of `res` is updated by adding `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to its current value. Given `i` is now 6, `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` equals `7 * 13`, which is 91. Adding this to the original `res` value of 27 gives `res` a new value of 39. All other variables remain unchanged.
