Output State: **`total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 1, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `n` must be greater than 4.**

Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop, `i` starts from `n` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1. Since the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be 1. The value of `total` remains 360 as no changes are made to `total` within the loop body other than the initial state. The variable `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) as no changes are made to it either. The matrix `mat` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify it. The condition that `n` must be greater than 4 still holds.
