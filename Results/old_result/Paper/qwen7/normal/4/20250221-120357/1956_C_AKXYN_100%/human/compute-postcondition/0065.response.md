Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `range(n, 0, -1)`. This means `i` starts from `n` and decreases by 1 until it reaches 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 360
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
   - `i` is 9
   - `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`
   - `res` is 81
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 10

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, if `i` was 9 at the end of the previous iteration, then `i` will be 8 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Determine the new value of `n`**: For the loop to continue, `n` must still satisfy the condition `n >= 10`. Since no information suggests `n` changes, we assume `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Adjusted States**:
- `i` will be 8.
- `n` must still be greater than or equal to 10.

The other variables (`total`, `t`, `mat`, `res`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 8, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 81, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10**
