Output State: **`res` is 140, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an input integer, `i` is equal to 1, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`.**

Explanation: The code creates a matrix (a list of lists) named `mat` where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`. The value of `res`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `n` remains an input integer, and `i` is explicitly set to 1.
