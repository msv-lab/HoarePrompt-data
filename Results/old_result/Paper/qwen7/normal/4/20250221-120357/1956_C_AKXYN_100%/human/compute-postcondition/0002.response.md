Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to n.**

Explanation: The code creates a matrix (a list of lists) where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`. The value of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from the initial state.
