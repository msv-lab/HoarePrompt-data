### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements and the given function summary.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
2. Operations can either permute the rows or the columns of the matrix.
3. The maximum possible sum can always be achieved in no more than \( 2n \) operations.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
        res = 0
        for i in range(n):
            res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
        print(res, n << 1)
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates the sum `res` of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- It prints this sum along with `n << 1`.
- It then prints a sequence of operations involving the integers from 1 to `n`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the sum `res` using the formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`. This formula does not directly relate to the problem's requirement of maximizing the sum of the matrix elements through permutations.
2. **Matrix Initialization**: The program initializes the matrix `mat` such that `a_{i, j} = j` for all `i` and `j`. This initialization does not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix elements.
3. **Operations**: The program prints a sequence of operations where it permutes each row and each column with the identity permutation (`range(1, n + 1)`). This means it does not perform any meaningful permutation to maximize the sum.

#### Example Test Case:
Consider the test case `n = 2`:
- Expected output: `7 3`
- Program output: `4 4`

The expected output is derived from the example given in the problem statement, where the maximum sum is 7 and it can be achieved with 3 operations:
```
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```
This results in the matrix:
```
1 2
2 1
```
The sum is `1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6`, which is close but not exactly 7. However, the program's output is `4 4`, indicating a different sum and number of operations.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the required operations to maximize the sum of the matrix elements. It initializes the matrix incorrectly and does not perform meaningful permutations to achieve the maximum sum. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
