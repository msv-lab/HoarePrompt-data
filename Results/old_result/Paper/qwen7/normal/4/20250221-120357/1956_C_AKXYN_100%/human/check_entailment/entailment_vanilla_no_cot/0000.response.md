Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix and performs the required operations within the constraints.

1. **Matrix Initialization**: The program initializes the \( n \times n \) matrix `mat` with values ranging from 1 to \( n \) in each row. This ensures that each row is a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum \( res \) is calculated using the formula \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1)(2i + 1) \). This formula is derived from the fact that each element \( a_{i,j} \) will be set to a value such that the sum of the matrix elements is maximized.

3. **Operations Execution**: The program then prints the maximum sum \( res \) and the number of operations required, which is \( 2n \). It performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations to ensure each element is set to its correct value.

4. **Output Format**: Each operation is printed in the required format, specifying the type of operation, the row or column index, and the permutation used.

Given the problem constraints and the requirements, the provided solution is correct and meets all the specified criteria.
