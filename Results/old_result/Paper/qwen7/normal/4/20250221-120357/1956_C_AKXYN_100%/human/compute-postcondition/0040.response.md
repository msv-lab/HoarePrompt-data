Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `total` is 360.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `mat` is a list of lists with sublists containing integers from 1 to `n`.

However, the specific value of `n` is not explicitly given, but it is stated that `n` must be greater than 4. Therefore, `i` will be `n-1` and `range(1, n + 1)` will generate a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`.

Given this, the print statement will output:
- `'1 %d' % i` which translates to `'1' followed by the value of `i` (which is `n-1`).
- `*range(1, n + 1)` which expands to a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

Since `n` is greater than 4, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n` which is 5 (as it must be greater than 4). This means `i` would be 4, and the range would be from 1 to 5.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1 4 1 2 3 4 5**
