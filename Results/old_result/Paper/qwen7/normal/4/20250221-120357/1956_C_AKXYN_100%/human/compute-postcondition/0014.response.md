Given the initial state:
- `res` is 140
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `i` is equal to `n-1`

We need to determine what will be printed by the following code snippet:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Value of `i`:**
   - According to the precondition, `i` is equal to `n - 1`.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 2, the smallest possible value for `n` is 3 (as `n > 2`).
   - Therefore, the smallest possible value for `i` is `3 - 1 = 2`.

2. **Value of `range(1, n + 1)`:**
   - For the smallest possible value of `n` (which is 3), `range(1, n + 1)` would be `range(1, 4)`.
   - This range generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3]`.

3. **Formatted String:**
   - The string `'1 %d' % i` will be formatted with the value of `i`.
   - If `i` is 2, then `'1 %d' % i` becomes `'1 2'`.

4. **Combining the Values:**
   - The `*range(1, n + 1)` part unpacks the range into separate arguments.
   - So, if `n` is 3, `*range(1, 4)` will expand to `1, 2, 3`.

Putting it all together, the print statement will output:
```
'1 2' followed by 1, 2, 3
```

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1 2 1 2 3**

This is the most precise description based on the given conditions and the smallest possible values for the variables.
