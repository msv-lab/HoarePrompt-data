Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `total` is 360.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). The value of `t` is not explicitly given, but it does not affect the print statement.
   - `i` is 8.
   - `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`. The value of `n` is not explicitly given, but it must be greater than or equal to 10.
   - `res` is 81.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 10.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))`.
   - `'2 %d' % i` formats the string to include the value of `i` (which is 8) after the number 2. So, this part of the string becomes `'2 8'`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)` unpacks the range object into individual arguments, so it will print all integers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Given that `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n`, which is 10, to determine the output. If `n` were larger, the output would simply include more numbers, but the format would remain the same.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
- The string `'2 8'`
- Followed by the numbers from 1 to 10, separated by spaces.

So, the output will be:
Output: **2 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10**
