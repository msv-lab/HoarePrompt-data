Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is 7
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 1

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still satisfy the condition `i < n`. Since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2.

Given these adjustments, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`res` is 7, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**
