Output State: **`m` is an integer equal to `n` - `num`, `i` is 0, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` is the first integer from the input split during the final iteration, `r` is the second integer from the input split during the final iteration, `num` is `num + 2`, `t` is `False`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` and `r` are the first and second integers from the input split respectively, `c` and `r` are integers.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is incremented by 1, so if the initial value of `num` was `num + 1`, it becomes `num + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
