Output State: **`m` is `n - 2 * k` and must be greater than or equal to `k - 2`, `i` is `k + 1` and must be at least `4`, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Since the initial values of `m` and `i` are defined but not explicitly given numerical values, they remain unchanged. The variable `dp[i]` is now assigned a new value based on the previous values of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`.
