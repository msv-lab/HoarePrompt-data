Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `r_i` and `c_i` remain undefined.**

The code `n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The value of `t` is updated to `t - 1` from its initial state, and `r_i` and `c_i` remain undefined as they were in the initial state.
