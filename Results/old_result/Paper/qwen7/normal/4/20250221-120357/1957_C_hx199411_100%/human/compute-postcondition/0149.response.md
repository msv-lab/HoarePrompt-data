Postcondition: **`m` is 0 or `m` is `n - (num + 2*k - 2)`. If `m` is 0, then `i` is 0. Otherwise, `i` is equal to `m`. `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` and `r` are the first and second integers from the input split respectively, `num` is `num + 2*k - 2`, `t` is `False`, `n` is the first integer from the input, and if `m` is not 0, `dp[m]` is calculated as `(dp[m-1] + (m-1) * dp[m-2] * 2) % 1000000007`.**
