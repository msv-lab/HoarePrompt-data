Output State: **`m` is an integer equal to `n` - `num`, `i` is 0, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` is the first integer from the input split during the final iteration, `r` is the second integer from the input split during the final iteration, `num` is either `num + 1` or `3`, `t` is `False`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` and `r` are the first and second integers from the input split respectively, `c` and `r` are integers.**

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `c` and `r`. The values of `m`, `i`, `k`, `num`, `t`, `n`, and the way `c` and `r` are described remain unchanged from the initial state.
