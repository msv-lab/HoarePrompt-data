Postcondition: **`m` is an integer equal to `n` - `num`, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input split during the final iteration, `r` is the second integer from the input split during the final iteration, `num` is either 1 or 2, `t` is `False`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` and `r` are the first and second integers from the input split respectively, `i` is less than `k`. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2.**
