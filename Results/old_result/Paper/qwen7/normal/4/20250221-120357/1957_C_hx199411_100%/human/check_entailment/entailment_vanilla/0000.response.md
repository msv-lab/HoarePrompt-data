Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - It then reads `k` pairs of coordinates `(r, c)` representing the moves made by the player.

2. **Counting Valid Moves:**
   - The program counts the number of diagonal moves (`c == r`) and non-diagonal moves (`c != r`).
   - For diagonal moves, only one rook is placed (since the computer cannot mirror this move).
   - For non-diagonal moves, two rooks are placed (one by the player and one by the computer).

3. **Calculating Remaining Moves:**
   - The variable `num` stores the total number of rooks placed so far.
   - The remaining positions on the board that can still be used are `m = n - num`.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Final Configurations:**
   - If `m` is 0 or 1, the program directly prints 1 because there are no more valid moves.
   - Otherwise, it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place the remaining rooks.
   - The array `dp` is initialized to store the number of configurations for `m` remaining positions.
   - The base cases are set: `dp[1] = 1` (one position, one way to place a rook), and `dp[2] = 3` (two positions, three ways to place two rooks).
   - The DP transition is defined as:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + (i-1) * dp[i-2] * 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula accounts for placing a rook in the current position and considering the previous states.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Verification:
- The logic for counting moves and calculating remaining positions is correct.
- The dynamic programming approach correctly handles the placement of rooks and ensures no two rooks attack each other.
- The modulo operation is applied correctly to handle large numbers.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
