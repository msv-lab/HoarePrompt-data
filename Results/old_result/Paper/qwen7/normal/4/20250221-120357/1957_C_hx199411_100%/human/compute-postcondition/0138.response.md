Output State: **`dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `m` is `n - (num + 2*k - 2)`, `i` is 0, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` and `r` are the first and second integers from the input split respectively, `num` is `num + 2*k - 2`, `t` is `False`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0, `m` is not equal to 0, `m` is not equal to 1**

Explanation: The code sets `dp[2]` to 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `m` is calculated as `n - (num + 2*k - 2)`, which is not affected by the assignment to `dp[2]`.
