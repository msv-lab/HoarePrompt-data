Output State: **`m` is an integer, `i` is `c + 1`, `k` remains an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split, `num` is either 2, 1, or 3, `t` is `False`, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 1**

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts using space as the delimiter, and converts these parts into integers. These integers are then assigned to `c` and `r`. The values of `m`, `k`, `num`, `t`, and the conditions on `k` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` becomes `c + 1` since `i` was originally `k + 1` and `k` remains an input integer.
