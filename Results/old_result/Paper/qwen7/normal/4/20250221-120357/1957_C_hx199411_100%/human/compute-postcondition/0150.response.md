Output State: **All iterations of the loop have completed, and the final value of `m` is either 0 or \( n - (num + 2 \times k - 2) \). If `m` is 0, then `i` is 0. Otherwise, `i` is equal to `m`. The variable `t` is `False`, indicating that the loop has finished.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have been executed, the final state of the program will depend on the value of `m`. If `m` evaluates to 0, it signifies that all possible configurations have been exhausted, and `i` would be 0. If `m` is non-zero, it represents the remaining count of configurations, and `i` will be set to this value. The loop variable `t` will be `False`, indicating that no more iterations are to be performed.
