Output State: **`m` is `n - 2 * k` and must be greater than or equal to `k - 2`, `i` is `k` and must be at least `3`, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Since `i` is equal to `k` and `k` is at least 3, `dp[i]` is now calculated based on the previous values of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`. The values of `m` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
