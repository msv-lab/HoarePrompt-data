Postcondition: **`m` is `n - (num + 2*k - 2)`, `i` is equal to `m`, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` and `r` are the first and second integers from the input split respectively, `num` is `num + 2*k - 2`, `t` is `False`, `n` is the first integer from the input, and `dp[m]` is calculated as `(dp[m-1] + (m-1) * dp[m-2] * 2) % 1000000007`.**

In natural language, after the if-else block executes, the variable `i` will have the value of `m`, and the `dp` list will have been updated such that `dp[m]` holds the value of `(dp[m-1] + (m-1) * dp[m-2] * 2) % 1000000007`. All other variables (`m`, `k`, `c`, `r`, `num`, `t`, `n`, and `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`) will retain their values from the initial state or as specified in the final iteration conditions.
