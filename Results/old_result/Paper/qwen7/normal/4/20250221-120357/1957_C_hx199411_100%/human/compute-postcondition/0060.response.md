Output State: **`num` is 1, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` remains an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered as input, `r` is the second integer entered as input, `num` is 1, `t` is `False`, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, and the current value of `c` is equal to `r`.**

Explanation: The line `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Initially, `num` was 0, so after executing this line, `num` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
