Postcondition: `m` is an integer, `i` is equal to `k`, and `k` remains an input integer. `c` and `r` are the last integers entered as input during the loop's final iteration, and `num` is the sum of `2` added `k` times (which is `2 * k`) plus the additional value added during each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r`. If `m` is 0, then no changes are made to `m`, `i`, `c`, `r`, `num`, and `dp`. If `m` is not 0, then `m` is `n - 2 * k`, and either `m` equals `1` and `i` equals `k`, or `m` is greater than or equal to `k - 2`, `i` is `k + 2`, and `dp` is a list with `m + 1` elements where `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`, and for each index `i` from `3` to `m`, `dp[i]` is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.
