Output State: **`m` is an integer, `i` is `c + 1`, `k` remains an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split, `num` is 3, `t` is `False`, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 1**

Explanation: The value of `num` is incremented by 2, so if `num` was initially 1, it becomes 3; if it was 2, it becomes 4 (but since `num` can only be 2, 1, or 3, it cannot be 4). If it was 3, it becomes 5 (again, not possible under the given conditions). Therefore, `num` is now 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
