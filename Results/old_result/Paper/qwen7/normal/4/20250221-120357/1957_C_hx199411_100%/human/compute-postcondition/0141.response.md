Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop runs from `3` to `m` inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is currently `3`.
   - `m` must be at least `3`.
   - `dp[3]` is `(dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % 1000000007`.

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `3` and increments by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `4`.
   - For the loop to continue, `m` must still be at least `4` because `i` needs to reach `m + 1` to terminate the loop.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be `4`.
   - `m` must remain at least `4`.

6. **Final State**:
   - `i` is `4`.
   - `m` must be at least `4`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: **`i` is 4, `m` must be at least 4**.
