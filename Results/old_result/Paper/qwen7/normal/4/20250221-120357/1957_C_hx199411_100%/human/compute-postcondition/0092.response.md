Output State: **`dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, `i` is `k` and must be at least 3, `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. The values of `i` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated value of `dp[i]` is calculated based on the previous values of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`, but since these values are not provided, they are left as part of the expression.
