Output State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `_` is now 1, `n` is now 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is non-zero. Each iteration of the loop sets `m` to half of `n` rounded down, and then subtracts `m` from `n`. This process continues until `n` becomes 0. After all iterations, `n` will be 0, and all other variables will retain their state from the last iteration or remain unchanged.
