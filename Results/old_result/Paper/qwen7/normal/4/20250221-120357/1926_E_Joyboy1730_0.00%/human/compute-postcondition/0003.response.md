Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5 â‹… 10^4, `_` is now 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `L`. No changes are made to the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions, and a new list `L` is created with no elements.
