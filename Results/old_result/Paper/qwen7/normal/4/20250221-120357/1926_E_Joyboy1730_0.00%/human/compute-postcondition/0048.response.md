Output State: **`k` is unchanged from its initial value, `tot` equals the sum of all elements in `L`, `n` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `L`. This does not affect the values of `k`, `tot`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The only change is that `L` is now an empty list.
