Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `_` is 1, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`. Since `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` becomes `n - m`. All other variables remain unchanged.
