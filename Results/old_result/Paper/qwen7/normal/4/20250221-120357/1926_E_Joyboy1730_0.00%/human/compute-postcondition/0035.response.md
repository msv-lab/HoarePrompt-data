Output State: **`k` is decreased by `tot`, `L` must have at least one element, `a` is the next element in `L`, `tot` is increased by `a`, `pow` is doubled, and `k` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `pow` is multiplied by 2, which means `pow` is now its original value times 2. All other variables (`k`, `tot`, `L`, `a`) remain in their original conditions as described in the initial state.
