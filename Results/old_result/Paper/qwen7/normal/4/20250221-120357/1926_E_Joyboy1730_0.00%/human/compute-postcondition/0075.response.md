Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `k` is decreased by `tot`. This means `k = k - tot`.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `m` is 0.
   - `pow` is 2.
   - `L` must contain at least one element (though the specific elements of `L` are not relevant to the print statement).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `pow * (2 * k - 1)`:**
   - We know `pow` is 2.
   - `k` is `k - tot`, but since `k` is not explicitly given a value, we'll keep it as `k - tot`.
   - Therefore, `2 * k - 1` becomes `2 * (k - tot) - 1`.

So, the expression inside the print statement simplifies to:
\[ \text{print}(2 * (k - tot) - 1) \]

Given the initial state, we can substitute the known values:
- `pow` is 2.
- `k` is `k - tot`.

Thus, the expression becomes:
\[ 2 * (k - tot) - 1 \]

Since `k` is `k - tot`, let's denote `k - tot` as `k_prime` for clarity:
\[ 2 * k_prime - 1 \]

Therefore, the print statement will output:
\[ 2 * (k - tot) - 1 \]

Output: **2 * (k - tot) - 1**
