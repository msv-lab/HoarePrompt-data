Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is unchanged, meaning it retains whatever value it had before.
- `L` must have at least one element, so let's denote the first element of `L` as `a`.
- `tot` is increased by `a`, but the value of `tot` itself is not relevant to the print statement.
- `pow` is doubled, so if the original value of `pow` was `p`, then after doubling, `pow` becomes `2 * p`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
```

Given that `pow` is now `2 * p` (where `p` is the original value of `pow`), and `k` is unchanged, the expression inside the print statement becomes `(2 * p) * (2 * k - 1)`.

Therefore, the output will be the result of this expression.

Output: **(2 * pow) * (2 * k - 1)**
