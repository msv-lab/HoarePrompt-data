Output State: **`k` is unchanged from its initial value, `tot` equals the sum of all elements in `L`, `n` is 0, `m` is 0**.

Explanation: The provided code initializes `tot` to 0. The loop that would modify `n` and `m` is not present in the given snippet. Since `n` is already set to 0, the loop condition `n != 0` is false, and thus the loop does not execute. As a result, `m` remains `(n + 1) // 2`, which evaluates to 0 when `n` is 0. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
