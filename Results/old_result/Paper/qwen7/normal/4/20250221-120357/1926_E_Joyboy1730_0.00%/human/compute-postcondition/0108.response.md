Output State: **`k` is decreased by 0, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `pow` is 1, and `t` is 1; `L` is an empty list, `tot` is 0.**

The code `pow = 1` simply reassigns the variable `pow` to the integer value 1. Since `pow` was already 1 in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
