Output State: **`k` is decreased by `tot`, `n` is 0, `m` is 0, `pow` is 2, `tot` is increased by `a`.**

Explanation: The code `tot += a` increases the value of `tot` by `a`. The other variables (`k`, `n`, `m`, and `pow`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `if tot < k and k <= tot + a` is not explicitly checked after the code execution, so we only update `tot` and keep the other variables as they were.
