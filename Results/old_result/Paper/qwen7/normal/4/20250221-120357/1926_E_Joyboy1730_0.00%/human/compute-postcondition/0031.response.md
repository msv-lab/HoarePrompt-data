Postcondition: `L` must have at least one element, `a` will be the next element in `L`, `tot` and `k` will be updated, and `pow` will be multiplied by 2. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `tot < k and k <= tot + a` is not met, the values of `tot`, `k`, and `pow` remain as they were before the if-else block executes.
