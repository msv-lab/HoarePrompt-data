Output State: **`k` is decreased by the sum of all elements in `L`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is 0, `pow` is 2^0, and `t` is 1; `L` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `L`. This does not affect the values of `k`, `n`, `m`, `pow`, and `t`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
