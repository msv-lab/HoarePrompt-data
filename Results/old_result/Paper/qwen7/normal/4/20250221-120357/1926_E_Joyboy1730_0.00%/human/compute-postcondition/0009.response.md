Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5â‹…10^4, `_` is now 1, `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The variable `n` is updated by subtracting `m` from itself, where `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`. Therefore, `n` becomes `n - (n + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
