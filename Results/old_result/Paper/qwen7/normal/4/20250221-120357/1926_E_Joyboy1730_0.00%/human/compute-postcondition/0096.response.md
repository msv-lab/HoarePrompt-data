Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop condition is `n`. This means the loop will execute as long as `n` is non-zero.

2. **Current state of `n`**: According to the given state right before the loop, `n` is an input integer.

3. **Determine the adjustment needed**: For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero. Since the current state does not specify any particular value for `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is not zero.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`k` is decreased by the sum of all elements in `L`, `n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `m` is 0, `pow` is 2^0, and `t` is 1; `L` is an empty list.**
