Output State: **`k` is unchanged from its initial value, `tot` equals the sum of all elements in `L`, `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated by subtracting `m` from itself. Given that `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` becomes `n - (n + 1) // 2`. The other variables (`k`, `tot`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
