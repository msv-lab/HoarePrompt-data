Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `index` is increased by 1 (implying `index` was 2 before the increase).
   - `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`.
   - `mp[pf[3]]` contains `[3]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, making `i` equal to 4.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `n` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
   - The other variables (`index`, `pf[3]`, and `mp[pf[3]]`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 4, `n` is the same as in the previous iteration**
