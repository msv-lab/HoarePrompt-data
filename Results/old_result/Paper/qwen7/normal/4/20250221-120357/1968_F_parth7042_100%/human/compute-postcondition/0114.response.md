Postcondition: `q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; if `x` equals 0, the `results` list now contains 'YES' and the loop proceeds to the next iteration; otherwise, the values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `index`, and `x` remain unchanged.
