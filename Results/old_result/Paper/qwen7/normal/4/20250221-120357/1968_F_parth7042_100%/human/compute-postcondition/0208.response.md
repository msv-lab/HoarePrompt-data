Output State: **`results` contains 'YES', 'NO'; `q` is greater than 1; `_` is incremented by 1; `l` is an integer value from `data[index + 2]`; `r` is the integer value from `data[index + 3]`; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `x` using the bitwise XOR operation between `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`. Since the values of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` are not specified, `x` is updated to the result of this operation. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
