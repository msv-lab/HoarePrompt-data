Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value from `data[index + 1]` to the variable `r`. The values of `q` and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `q` must still be greater than 0, and `l` remains as an integer value from `data[index]`.
