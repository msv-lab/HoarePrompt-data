Postcondition: `results` contains 'YES', `index` is incremented by 3, `l` is assigned the value of `data[index - 4]`, `r` is assigned the value of `int(data[index - 2])`, `x` is 0, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the list `v1`, `it2` is the value of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and either `it1` is not less than `len(v1)` or `it2` is less than 0 or `v1[it1]` is greater than or equal to `v2[it2]`.
