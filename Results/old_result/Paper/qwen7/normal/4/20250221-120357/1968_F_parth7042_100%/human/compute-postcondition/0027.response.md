Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 5, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `mp` is a defaultdict where all values are lists, `mp[0]` is a list containing the value 0, `i` is 11 (since `i` was 10 and was incremented by 1), `a[8]` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `pf[9]` is `pf[8]` ^ `a[8]`, `mp[pf[9]]` is a list containing the values 8 and 11.**

Explanation:
- The line `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 11) to the list `mp[pf[9]]`.
- Since `mp[pf[9]]` was previously a list containing the value 8, after appending 11, it now contains both 8 and 11.
- All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
