Postcondition: **`results` contains 'YES', 'NO', 'YES', 'YES' or 'YES', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES', 'NO'. `q` is greater than 1; `_` is `q - 1`; `l` is converted to an integer from `data[index]`; `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it2` is the index where `r - 1` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted. If `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, then 'YES' is appended to `results`. Otherwise, 'NO' is appended to `results`.**
