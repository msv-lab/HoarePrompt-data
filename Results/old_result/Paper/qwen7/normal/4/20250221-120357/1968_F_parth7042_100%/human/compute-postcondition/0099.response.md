Output State: **`i` is 3; `index` is increased by 1; `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`; `mp[pf[3]]` contains `[3]`**

Explanation: The code `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` updates the dictionary `mp` by appending the current value of `i` (which is 3) to the list at the key `pf[i]`. Given the initial state, `pf[3]` is already set to `pf[2] ^ a[3]`. Therefore, `mp[pf[3]]` will now contain the value `[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
