Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index]` (converted to an integer) to the variable `l`. The precondition that `q` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The value of `l` is now an integer derived from `data[index]`.
