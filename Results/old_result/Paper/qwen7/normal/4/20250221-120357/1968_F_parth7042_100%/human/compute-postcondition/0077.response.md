Output State: **`results` now contains 'YES' more than before, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index + 6]`, `q` must be greater than 0 and equal to `q - 1 - 1`, `index` is `index + 10`, `l` is now `int(data[index])`, `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `results` now contains 'YES' more than before.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('YES')` adds the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the updated state includes the new element `'YES'` in the `results` list.
