Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `q` is `q - (n + 1)`, `index` is `index + (n + 1)`, `l` and `r` are the integers from `data[index]` and `data[index + 1]` respectively, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted, and `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `n` as an integer. All other variables retain their values from the previous state. Specifically, `n` now holds the integer value of `data[index]`.
