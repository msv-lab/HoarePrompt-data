Output State: **`results` contains 'YES', 'NO', 'YES' or 'YES', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES'; `q` is greater than 1; `_` is `q - 1`; `l` is converted to an integer from `data[index]`; `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `index` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
