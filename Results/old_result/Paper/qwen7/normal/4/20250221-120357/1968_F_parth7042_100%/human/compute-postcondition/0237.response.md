Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` will be 0, `n` will retain its final value from the last iteration, `q` will be 0, `index` will be equal to its initial value plus twice the total number of iterations (i.e., `2 * t`), and `results` will contain 'YES' or 'NO' appended based on the conditions evaluated within the loop for all `q` queries.**

In natural language, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `t` will be set to 0 since the loop runs `t` times and `t` is decremented by 1 in each iteration. The variable `n` will hold the final value it had in the last iteration. The variable `q` will also be 0 as all queries are processed. The `index` will be equal to its initial value (2) plus twice the total number of iterations (since `index` is incremented by 2 in each query). The `results` list will contain the outcomes ('YES' or 'NO') of all the queries processed during the loop's execution.
