Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 5, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `mp` is a defaultdict where all values are lists, `mp[0]` is a list containing the value 0, `i` is 9 (since `i` was 8 and was incremented by 1), `a[8]` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `pf[8]` is `pf[7]` ^ `a[8]`, `mp[pf[8]]` is a list containing the value 7.**

Explanation: The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was increased by 4, so now it is increased by 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
