Output State: **`results` contains 'YES' more than before, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index + 6]`, `q` must be greater than 0 and equal to `q - 1 - 1`, `index` is `index + 10`, `l` is now `int(data[index])`, `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `it1` to be the index in `v1` where the value `l` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `v1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
