Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `data` is a list of strings representing the split input; `index` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `index` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t` or `data`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of `t` being a positive integer and `data` being a list of strings representing the split input, while adding that `index` is now 0.
