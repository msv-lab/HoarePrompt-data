You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.

        if j == 0:
            print(3)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute all its iterations, and since the condition `j == 0` is met after the third iteration, the loop will print `3` and terminate. Therefore, `i` will be equal to `n`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is the input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the final input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 0, `p` is the integer at index `n-1` of the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`. After the loop completes, the program will print `3` and end.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to consider scenarios where no pair of friends can come to the party together with just two invitations. Let's analyze this through an example.

Consider the input:
```
3
4
2 3 4 1
```

According to the problem description, Monocarp needs to send invitations to ensure at least two friends come to the party. However, the program logic does not cover this scenario properly. In the given example, if Monocarp sends invitations to friends 1 and 2, only friend 1 will come because friend 2's best friend (friend 3) did not receive an invitation. Similarly, sending invitations to friends 2 and 3 would result in only friend 2 coming. Therefore, the program incorrectly outputs `2` instead of `3`, which is the correct minimum number of invitations needed.

To fix this, the program needs to check all possible pairs of friends and ensure that at least one pair can come to the party with just two invitations. This requires a more comprehensive approach to verify all possible pairs and their corresponding best friends.
