Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting a new input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `j` is 0.
- `p` is the integer at index `n-1` of the list `l`.
- `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`.

The `print(3)` statement simply outputs the integer 3, regardless of the values of other variables.

Output: **3**
