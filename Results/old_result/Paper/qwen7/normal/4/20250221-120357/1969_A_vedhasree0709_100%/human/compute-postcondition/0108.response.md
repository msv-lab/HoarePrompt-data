Output State: **`i` is 3; `p` is `l[2]`; `q` is `l[1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `p` and `q` remain unchanged as they are derived from the list `l` and are not affected by the increment operation on `i`. The condition `if q == i + 1:` is not evaluated here, only the value of `i` is updated.
