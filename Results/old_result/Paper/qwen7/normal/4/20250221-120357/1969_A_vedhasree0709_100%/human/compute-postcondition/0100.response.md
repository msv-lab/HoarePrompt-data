The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i <= n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

Since `i` is currently 2, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3**
