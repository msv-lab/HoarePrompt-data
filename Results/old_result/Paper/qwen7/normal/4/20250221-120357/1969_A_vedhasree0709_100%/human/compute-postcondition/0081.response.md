Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index `n-1` of the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`, and a new input string is split and converted to a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code `i = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `i`. All other variables retain their previous values as per the initial state.
