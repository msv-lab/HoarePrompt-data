Output State: `i` is `n`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is the input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index `n-1` of the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop continues to increment `i` until it is no longer less than or equal to `n-1`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The variable `j` is set to 1 when the condition `q == i + 1` is met inside the loop, and since the loop breaks out of the while loop once this condition is satisfied, `j` remains 1. The values of `p` and `q` are determined by the last iteration of the loop, where `p` is the integer at index `n-1` of the list `l`, and `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`.
