Output State: **`i` is 3; `p` is `l[2]`; `q` is `l[1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `p` and `q` remain unchanged as they are based on the list `l` and are not affected by the increment operation on `i`. The condition `if q == i + 1:` would still need to be evaluated with the updated value of `i`, but since no further action (like breaking out of a loop) is specified, we only update `i`.
