You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))

            print(3)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute all its iterations, and since the condition `j == 0` is met after the third iteration, the loop will print `3` and terminate. Therefore, `i` will be equal to `n`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is the input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the final input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 0, `p` is the integer at index `n-1` of the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`. After the loop completes, the program will print `3` and end.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \), a list of \( n \) distinct integers \( p \), and checks if the sequence described by \( p \) meets a specific condition. If the condition is met within the first two iterations of a loop, it prints `2`. Otherwise, after checking all elements, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `l`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes `i` and `j` to 0. `i` is used to iterate through the list of friends, and `j` is used to check if a pair of friends who are each other's best friends is found.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n - 1`.
   - For each friend `i`, it finds their best friend `p` using `p = l[i]`.
   - It then checks if `q = l[p - 1]` is equal to `i + 1`. If this condition is true, it means `i` and `p` are each other's best friends.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and sets `j` to `1` to break out of the loop.

4. **Handling No Pair Found**:
   - If no such pair is found after the loop, it prints `3`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Logic for Finding Pairs**:
   - The logic to find pairs of friends who are each other's best friends is flawed. The program only checks if `q == i + 1`, which is not sufficient. It should check if `q` is equal to the index `i` (not `i + 1`).

2. **Handling Multiple Pairs**:
   - The program assumes that if one pair is found, the answer is `2`. However, it does not handle cases where multiple pairs exist, and the minimum number of invitations needed might be more than `2`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if there are no pairs of friends who are each other's best friends, it incorrectly prints `3`.

### Correct Solution

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Identify all pairs of friends who are each other's best friends.
- Ensure that at least one friend from each pair receives an invitation.
- Minimize the number of invitations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pairs = []
        
        # Find all pairs of friends who are each other's best friends
        for i in range(n):
            p = l[i] - 1
            if l[p] - 1 == i:
                pairs.append((i, p))
        
        # If there are at least 2 pairs, we can invite one from each pair
        if len(pairs) >= 2:
            print(len(pairs))
        else:
            # Otherwise, we need to invite more friends
            # We can always invite at most 3 friends to ensure at least 2 come
            print(min(len(pairs) + 1, 3))
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly identify pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and does not handle edge cases properly. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
