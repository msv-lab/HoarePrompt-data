Output State: **`i` is 8, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index 5 of the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`, and `l` is updated to a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `l`. The values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `j`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged.
