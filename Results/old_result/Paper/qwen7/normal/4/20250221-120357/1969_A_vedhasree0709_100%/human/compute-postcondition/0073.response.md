Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is the input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index `n-1` of the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches `n`. During each iteration, it sets `p` to the value at index `i` of the list `l`, and `q` to the value at index `p - 1` of the list `l`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, it prints `2`, sets `j` to `1`, and breaks out of the loop. Since `j` is set to `1` before breaking, the loop will exit as soon as the condition `q == i + 1` is met. Given the information, we know that `j` is `1` after the loop completes, indicating the loop exited due to the condition being met at some point. The final value of `i` will be `n`, and the values of `p` and `q` will depend on the specific values in the list `l` at the last iteration.
