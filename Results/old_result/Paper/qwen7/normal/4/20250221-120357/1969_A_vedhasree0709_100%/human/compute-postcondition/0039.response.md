Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - `i` is 7.
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `p` is the integer at index 5 of the list `l`.
   - `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`.
   - The loop has completed its iterations, meaning `i` has incremented past the last index of the list `l`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`. Since the loop has completed its iterations, it means that the value of `int(input())` was less than or equal to the current value of `i` (which is 7).

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than the current value of `i` (which is 7). Therefore, the next value of `int(input())` should be 8 or more.

Given these points, let's summarize the states that need to be adjusted:

- `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be 8.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `j` remains unchanged.
- `p` remains unchanged.
- `q` remains unchanged.

Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the state of `int(input())` needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute again. The value of `int(input())` should be 8 or more.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 8, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 4, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index 5 of the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`, and the loop can execute one more time if `int(input())` is 8 or more.**
