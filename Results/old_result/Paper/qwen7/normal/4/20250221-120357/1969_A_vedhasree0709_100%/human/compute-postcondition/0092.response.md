The loop condition in the given `while` loop is `i <= n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be less than `n - 1` at the start of the next iteration.

Given the states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000 (this state does not affect the loop condition)
- `n` must be at least 1 (this state does not affect the loop condition)
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer (this state does not affect the loop condition)
- `j` is 1 (this state does not affect the loop condition)
- `p` is the integer at index `i` of the list `l` (this state does not affect the loop condition)
- `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l` (this state does not affect the loop condition)

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Since `i` is currently 1, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index `i` of the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`**
