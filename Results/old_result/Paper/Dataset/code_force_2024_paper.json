For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,\n0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.\n\nYou are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what\narray a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the\nabove process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number\ncan be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\\,244\\,353 .\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger t (1 \\leq t \\leq 1000 ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of\nthe test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 5000\n) \u2014 the size of the hidden array a .\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n\n(|p_i| \\le n ) \u2014 the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nIt is guaranteed that p_1 \\le p_2 \\le \\ldots \\le p_n .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output the answer modulo 998\\,244\\,353 .\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    5\n    \n    1\n    \n    0\n    \n    1\n    \n    1\n    \n    3\n    \n    -1 1 2\n    \n    5\n    \n    -1 0 0 1 1\n    \n    5\n    \n    -4 -3 -3 -2 -1\n\nOutput\n\n    0\n    1\n    0\n    3\n    1\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]\nand a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =\n[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum\narray p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted\nprefix sum array p = [1] .\n\nIn the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could\nresult in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .\n\nIn the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the\nsorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:\n\n  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . \n  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . \n  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . \n\nFor the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the\nsorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .",

Both\nplayers have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with\ncoordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at\n(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not\ncoincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.\n\nOn her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or\ndown-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,\nup-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board\nboundaries.\n\nMore formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with\ncoordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +\n1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from\nthe cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b\n- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions\n1 \\le x' \\le h and 1 \\le y' \\le w .\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/d2faa6ca73d70e765c2cc6ef0834e24c2e4a5528.png)\nExample game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.\nArrows indicate possible moves.\n\nA player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the\nother player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice\u2014if she is in\nthe last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob\u2014if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),\nthe game immediately ends in a draw.\n\nWhat will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) \u2014 the number of test cases. This is followed by\nthe description of the test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,\ny_a , x_b , y_b (1 \\le x_a, x_b \\le h \\le 10^6 , 1 \\le y_a, y_b \\le w \\le 10^9\n) \u2014 the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's\nchips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \\ne x_b or y_a \\ne y_b .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output \"Alice\" if Alice wins, \"Bob\" if Bob wins, and\n\"Draw\" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in\nany case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings \"bOb\", \"bob\",\n\"Bob\", and \"BOB\" will be accepted as Bob's victory.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    12\n    \n    6 5 2 2 5 3\n    \n    4 1 2 1 4 1\n    \n    1 4 1 3 1 1\n    \n    5 5 1 4 5 2\n    \n    4 4 1 1 4 4\n    \n    10 10 1 6 10 8\n    \n    10 10 2 6 10 7\n    \n    10 10 9 1 8 1\n    \n    10 10 8 1 10 2\n    \n    10 10 1 1 2 1\n    \n    10 10 1 3 4 1\n    \n    10 10 3 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n\n    Alice\n    Bob\n    Draw\n    Draw\n    Draw\n    Alice\n    Draw\n    Draw\n    Bob\n    Alice\n    Alice\n    Draw",

        "description": "Given an array a of n integers, an array b of m integers, and an even number k\n.\n\nYour task is to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly \\frac{k}{2}\nelements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every\ninteger from 1 to k is included.\n\nFor example:\n\n  * If a=[2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 4, 10, 5] , k=6 , then it is possible to choose elements with values 2, 3, 6 from array a and elements with values 1, 4, 5 from array b . In this case, all numbers from 1 to k=6 will be included among the chosen elements.\n  * If a=[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 8, 10, 3] , k=6 , then it is not possible to choose elements in the required way. \n\nNote that you are not required to find a way to choose the elements \u2014 your\nprogram should only check whether it is possible to choose the elements in the\nrequired way.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) \u2014\nthe number of test cases.

As\nthe answer, output \"YES\" if it is possible to choose \\frac{k}{2} numbers from\neach array in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1\nto k is included. Otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\nYou can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,\nthe strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be accepted as a positive\nanswer.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    6\n    \n    6 5 6\n    \n    2 3 8 5 6 5\n    \n    1 3 4 10 5\n    \n    6 5 6\n    \n    2 3 4 5 6 5\n    \n    1 3 8 10 3\n    \n    3 3 4\n    \n    1 3 5\n    \n    2 4 6\n    \n    2 5 4\n    \n    1 4\n    \n    7 3 4 4 2\n    \n    1 4 2\n    \n    2\n    \n    6 4 4 2\n    \n    1 5 2\n    \n    3\n    \n    2 2 1 4 3\n\nOutput\n\n    YES\n    NO\n    YES\n    YES\n    NO\n    NO\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal\nto 2 , 3 , and 6 from array a and elements equal to 1 , 4 , and 5 from array b\n. Thus, all numbers from 1 to k=6 are included among the chosen elements.\n\nIn the second test case of the example, it can be shown that it is not\npossible to choose exactly three elements from each array in the required way.\n\nIn the third test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal\nto 1 and 3 from array a and elements equal to 2 and 4 from array b . Thus, all\nnumbers from 1 to k=4 are included among the chosen elements.",

Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \\le n \\le m\n\\le \\min(\\frac{n\\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \\cdot 10^5) ) \u2014 the size of the graph and\nthe number of edges.\n\nThe next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \\le\nu, v \\le n , u \\ne v , 1 \\le w \\le 10^6 ) \u2014 vertices u and v are connected by\nan edge of weight w .\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.\nNote that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple\ncycle in the graph.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not\nexceed 2 \\cdot 10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:\n\n  * b \u2014 the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, \n  * k \u2014 the number of vertices in the found cycle. \n\nOn the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n \u2014 the vertices of the cycle in\ntraversal order.\n\nNote that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is\nalways at least one simple cycle in the graph.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    5\n    \n    6 6\n    \n    1 2 1\n    \n    2 3 1\n    \n    3 1 1\n    \n    4 5 1\n    \n    5 6 1\n    \n    6 4 1\n    \n    6 6\n    \n    1 2 10\n    \n    2 3 8\n    \n    3 1 5\n    \n    4 5 100\n    \n    5 6 40\n    \n    6 4 3\n    \n    6 15\n    \n    1 2 4\n    \n    5 2 8\n    \n    6 1 7\n    \n    6 3 10\n    \n    6 5 1\n    \n    3 2 8\n    \n    4 3 4\n    \n    5 3 6\n    \n    2 6 6\n    \n    5 4 5\n    \n    4 1 3\n    \n    6 4 5\n    \n    4 2 1\n    \n    3 1 7\n    \n    1 5 5\n    \n    4 6\n    \n    2 3 2\n    \n    1 3 10\n    \n    1 4 1\n    \n    3 4 7\n    \n    2 4 5\n    \n    1 2 2\n    \n    4 5\n    \n    2 1 10\n    \n    3 1 3\n    \n    4 2 6\n    \n    1 4 7\n    \n    2 3 3\n\nOutput\n\n    1 3\n    1 2 3 \n    3 3\n    6 4 5 \n    1 5\n    4 2 1 6 3 \n    1 4\n    1 4 3 2 \n    3 3\n    2 3 1",

Note that the square grid of size\nn \\times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.\n\nHelp little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the\nminimum number of cells he needs to color.\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger t (1 \\le t \\le 1000 ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of\nthe test cases follows.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \\leq n \\leq\n10^8 , 1 \\leq k \\leq 4n - 2 ) \u2014 the size of the square grid and the minimum\nnumber of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of cells that\nneed to be colored.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    7\n    \n    3 4\n    \n    3 3\n    \n    3 10\n    \n    3 9\n    \n    4 7\n    \n    7 11\n    \n    2 3\n\nOutput\n\n    2\n    2\n    6\n    5\n    4\n    6\n    2\n    \nNote\n\nIn the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all\ndiagonals are marked in purple.\n\nIn the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at\nleast one colored cell:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/c88e80de5be4f91764dbe5bdc534c50fec115db3.png)\n\nIn the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain\nat least one colored cell:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/624a36083689f6fb20bf243e5d1707fdcd71ef60.png)",

        "description": "Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need\nthis list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.\n\nPlayers take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make\nthe first move.\n\n  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.\n  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \\ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .\n\nPlayers can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.\nafter Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this\ninteger is not less than 10^m (i.e., \\ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna\nwins.\n\nIt can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both\nplayers play optimally.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) \u2014 the number of test\ncases.\n\nThen follows the description of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot\n10^5 , 0 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^6 ) \u2014 the number of integers in the list and the\nparameter determining when Sasha wins.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n (1\n\\le a_i \\le 10^9 ) \u2014 the list that Sasha gave to Anna.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \\cdot\n10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output:\n\n  * \"Sasha\", if Sasha wins with optimal play; \n  * \"Anna\", if Anna wins with optimal play. \n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    9\n    \n    2 2\n    \n    14 2\n    \n    3 5\n    \n    9 56 1\n    \n    4 10\n    \n    1 2007 800 1580\n    \n    4 5\n    \n    5000 123 30 4\n    \n    10 10\n    \n    6 4 6 2 3 1 10 9 10 7\n    \n    1 1\n    \n    6\n    \n    1 1\n    \n    10\n    \n    8 9\n    \n    1 2 9 10 10 2 10 2\n    \n    4 5\n    \n    10 10 10 10\n\nOutput\n\n    Sasha\n    Anna\n    Anna\n    Sasha\n    Sasha\n    Anna\n    Anna\n    Anna\n    Sasha\n    \nNote\n\nConsider the first test case.\n\nAnna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and\n14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna\nhad reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41\nand 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 .

        "description": "This is an interactive problem.\n\nThere is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \\ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation\nof \\\\{0,1,\\ldots,n-1\\\\} .\n\nYou need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \\oplus p_j is\nmaximized, where \\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR\noperation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).\n\nTo do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \\le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \\mid p_b) and y = (p_c \\mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .\n\nPlease find any two indices i and j (0 \\le i,j < n ) such that p_i \\oplus p_j\nis maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are\nmultiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of\nthem.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of\ntest cases t (1 \\le t \\le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nInteraction\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \\le n \\le 10^4 ).\nAt this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \\ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The\ninteractor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is\nfixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.\n\nTo ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \\le a,b,c,d\n< n ) and print the line of the following form:\n\n  * \"? a b c d\" \n\nAfter that, you receive:\n\n  * \"<\" if (p_a \\mid p_b) < (p_c \\mid p_d) ; \n  * \"=\" if (p_a \\mid p_b) = (p_c \\mid p_d) ; \n  * \">\" if (p_a \\mid p_b) > (p_c \\mid p_d) . \n\nYou can make at most 3n queries of this form.\n\nNext, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \\le i, j < n )\nsuch that p_i \\oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:\n\n  * \"! i j\" \n\nNote that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account\nwhen counting the number of queries asked.\n\nAfter this, proceed to the next test case.\n\nIf you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must\nterminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.\nOtherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will\ncontinue to read from a closed stream.\n\nAfter printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output\nthe end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict\nIdleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; \n  * System.out.flush() in Java; \n  * flush(output) in Pascal; \n  * stdout.flush() in Python; \n  * see the documentation for other languages. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .\n\nHacks\n\nTo hack, follow the test format below.\n\nThe first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \\le t \\le 10^3 ). The\ndescription of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \\le n \\le 10^4 ).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\\ldots,p_{n-1} ,\nwhich represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .\n\nThe sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    2\n    4\n    \n    <\n    \n    =\n    \n    >\n    \n    2\n    \nOutput\n\n    ? 0 2 3 1\n    \n    ? 1 1 2 3\n    \n    ? 1 2 0 3\n    \n    ! 3 2\n    \n    ! 0 1\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .\n\nFor the query \"? 0 2 3 1\", the jury return \"<\" because (p_0 \\mid p_2) = (0\n\\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \\mid p_1) = (2 \\mid 3) = 3 .\n\nFor the query \"? 1 1 2 3\", the jury return \"=\" because (p_1 \\mid p_1) = (3\\mid\n3)= 3 = (p_2 \\mid p_3) = (1 \\mid 2)=3 .\n\nFor the query \"? 1 2 0 3\", the jury return \">\" because (p_1 \\mid p_2) = (3\n\\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \\mid p_3) = (0\\mid 2)=2 .\n\nThe answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \\oplus p_2) = (2 \\oplus 1) = 3 is\nindeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \\oplus p_j . Another valid\nanswer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,\nthe answer is considered correct.\n\nIn the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any\ncase, p_0 \\oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.",

Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \\mid p_b) and y = (p_c \\mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR).

To do this, use:\n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; \n  * System.out.flush() in Java; \n  * flush(output) in Pascal; \n  * stdout.flush() in Python; \n  * see the documentation for other languages. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .\n\nHacks\n\nTo hack, follow the test format below.\n\nThe first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \\le t \\le 10^3 ). The\ndescription of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \\le n \\le 10^4 ).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\\ldots,p_{n-1} ,\nwhich represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .\n\nThe sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    2\n    4\n    \n    <\n    \n    =\n    \n    >\n    \n    2\n    \nOutput\n\n    ? 0 2 3 1\n    \n    ? 1 1 2 3\n    \n    ? 1 2 0 3\n    \n    ! 3 2\n    \n    ! 0 1\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .\n\nFor the query \"? 0 2 3 1\", the jury return \"<\" because (p_0 \\mid p_2) = (0\n\\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \\mid p_1) = (2 \\mid 3) = 3 .\n\nFor the query \"? 1 1 2 3\", the jury return \"=\" because (p_1 \\mid p_1) = (3\\mid\n3)= 3 = (p_2 \\mid p_3) = (1 \\mid 2)=3 .\n\nFor the query \"? 1 2 0 3\", the jury return \">\" because (p_1 \\mid p_2) = (3\n\\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \\mid p_3) = (0\\mid 2)=2 .\n\nThe answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \\oplus p_2) = (2 \\oplus 1) = 3 is\nindeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \\oplus p_j . Another valid\nanswer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,\nthe answer is considered correct.\n\nIn the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any\ncase, p_0 \\oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.",

They are numbered from 1\nto n in the clockwise order.\n\nLet's call a transition a movement of the ball from one player to his\nneighbor. The transition can be made clockwise or counterclockwise.\n\nLet's call the clockwise (counterclockwise) distance from player y_1 to player\ny_2 the number of transitions clockwise (counterclockwise) that need to be\nmade to move from player y_1 to player y_2 . For example, if n=7 then the\nclockwise distance from 2 to 5 is 3 , and the counterclockwise distance from 2\nto 5 is 4 .\n\nInitially, the ball is with the player number x (players are numbered\nclockwise). On the i -th move the person with the ball throws it at a distance\nof r_i (1 \\le r_i \\le n - 1 ) clockwise or counterclockwise. For example, if\nthere are 7 players, and the 2 nd player, after receiving the ball, throws it\na distance of 5 , then the ball will be caught by either the 7 th player\n(throwing clockwise) or the 4 th player (throwing counterclockwise).

Each of them\ncontains an integer r_i (1 \\le r_i \\le n - 1 ) \u2014 the distance at which the i\n-th throw was made, and a symbol c_i , equal to '0', '1', or '?':\n\n  * if c_i ='0', then the i -th throw was made clockwise, \n  * if c_i ='1', then the i -th throw was made counterclockwise, \n  * if c_i ='?', then Bernard does not remember the direction and the i -th throw could have been made either clockwise or counterclockwise. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum n \\cdot m (n multiplied by m ) over all test\ncases does not exceed 2 \\cdot 10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output two lines.\n\nIn the first line, output the number of players k (1 \\le k \\le n ) who could\nhave the ball at the end of the game.\n\nIn the next line, output k numbers b_i (1 \\le b_i \\le n ) \u2014 the numbers of the\nplayers in increasing order. All numbers must be different.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    5\n    \n    6 3 2\n    \n    2 ?\n    \n    2 ?\n    \n    2 ?\n    \n    12 1 2\n    \n    3 1\n    \n    10 7 4\n    \n    2 ?\n    \n    9 1\n    \n    4 ?\n    \n    7 0\n    \n    2 0\n    \n    8 1\n    \n    5 ?\n    \n    5 3 1\n    \n    4 0\n    \n    4 ?\n    \n    1 ?\n    \n    4 1 1\n    \n    2 ?\n\nOutput\n\n    3\n    2 4 6 \n    1\n    11 \n    4\n    3 5 7 9 \n    3\n    2 3 5 \n    1\n    3 \n    \nNote\n\nBelow is an illustration of three throws for the first test case.

As it turned out, Bernard remembered the distances for each\nof the throws and the direction for some of the throws (clockwise or\ncounterclockwise).\n\nRudolf asks you to help him and based on the information from Bernard,\ncalculate the numbers of the players who could have the ball after m throws.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, x (2 \\le n \\le\n1000 , 1 \\le m \\le 1000 , 1 \\le x \\le n ) \u2014 the number of players, the number\nof throws made, and the number of the player who threw the ball first,\nrespectively.\n\nThe next m lines contain information about each throw in order. Each of them\ncontains an integer r_i (1 \\le r_i \\le n - 1 ) \u2014 the distance at which the i\n-th throw was made, and a symbol c_i , equal to '0', '1', or '?':\n\n  * if c_i ='0', then the i -th throw was made clockwise, \n  * if c_i ='1', then the i -th throw was made counterclockwise, \n  * if c_i ='?', then Bernard does not remember the direction and the i -th throw could have been made either clockwise or counterclockwise. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum n \\cdot m (n multiplied by m ) over all test\ncases does not exceed 2 \\cdot 10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output two lines.\n\nIn the first line, output the number of players k (1 \\le k \\le n ) who could\nhave the ball at the end of the game.\n\nIn the next line, output k numbers b_i (1 \\le b_i \\le n ) \u2014 the numbers of the\nplayers in increasing order. All numbers must be different.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    5\n    \n    6 3 2\n    \n    2 ?\n    \n    2 ?\n    \n    2 ?\n    \n    12 1 2\n    \n    3 1\n    \n    10 7 4\n    \n    2 ?\n    \n    9 1\n    \n    4 ?\n    \n    7 0\n    \n    2 0\n    \n    8 1\n    \n    5 ?\n    \n    5 3 1\n    \n    4 0\n    \n    4 ?\n    \n    1 ?\n    \n    4 1 1\n    \n    2 ?\n\nOutput\n\n    3\n    2 4 6 \n    1\n    11 \n    4\n    3 5 7 9 \n    3\n    2 3 5 \n    1\n    3 \n    \nNote\n\nBelow is an illustration of three throws for the first test case.

To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \\le i \\le\nm , 1 \\le j \\le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,\nhe obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted\ninto the array a ).\n\nTo determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the\nproblems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i\n> 1 ).\n\nWhat is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at\nmost one problem, created according to the described rules?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) \u2014\nthe number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \\le\nn \\le 10^5 , 1 \\le m, k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 ) \u2014 the number of prepared problems,\nthe number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots a_n\n(1 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) \u2014 the complexities of the\nprepared problems.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \\dots d_m\n(1 \\le d_i \\le 10^9 ) \u2014 the complexities of the models.\n\nThe fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \\dots f_k\n(1 \\le f_i \\le 10^9 ) \u2014 the complexities of the functions.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \\cdot\n10^5 .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \\cdot\n10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase, output a single number \u2014 the minimum imbalance that Rudolf\ncan achieve.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    7\n    \n    5 5 5\n    \n    5 10 15 20 26\n    \n    11 14 16 13 8\n    \n    16 4 5 3 1\n    \n    7 6 5\n    \n    1 4 7 10 18 21 22\n    \n    2 3 5 7 4 2\n    \n    6 8 9 3 2\n    \n    7 6 5\n    \n    1 4 7 10 18 21 22\n    \n    2 3 5 7 4 2\n    \n    6 8 13 3 2\n    \n    5 6 3\n    \n    2 10 13 20 25\n    \n    11 6 10 16 14 5\n    \n    6 17 15\n    \n    4 2 2\n    \n    11 12 14 15\n    \n    19 14\n    \n    10 6\n    \n    8 4 2\n    \n    3 10 16 18 21 22 29 30\n    \n    9 13 16 15\n    \n    4 2\n    \n    2 4 7\n    \n    4 21\n    \n    4 15 14 5\n    \n    20 1 15 1 12 5 11\n\nOutput\n\n    5\n    4\n    5\n    8\n    2\n    7\n    11",

The only difference between the two\nversions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks\nonly if both versions are solved.\n\nBessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in\nthe form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are\nnumbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of\nthose vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other\nwords, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.\n\nBessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle\nto keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake\ndoes not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in\nthe cake, but those will not be counted).\n\nBessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form\ndiagonals.

She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the\nnumber of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4 ) \u2014 the number\nof test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4\n\\leq n \\leq 10^9 , 2 \\leq x \\leq \\min(n, 2 \\cdot 10^5) , 0 \\leq y \\leq n - x )\n\u2014 the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,\nand the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.\n\nThe second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the\nvertices Bessie has chosen.\n\nIt is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \\cdot 10^5\n.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-\nintersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    3\n    \n    8 4 2\n    \n    1 6 2 5\n    \n    7 3 1\n    \n    6 4 3\n    \n    4 2 2\n    \n    1 3\n\nOutput\n\n    6\n    5\n    2\n    \nNote\n\nIn test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting\ntriangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in\nthe following pictures:\n\nThe green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent\nvertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,\nand the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/13b28beb7f5f0d100798f357f58c804c5314c869.png)",

        "description": "In the village of Letovo, there are n houses. The villagers decided to build a\nbig road that will divide the village into left and right sides. Each resident\nwants to live on either the right or the left side of the street, which is\ndescribed as a sequence a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n , where a_j = 0 if the resident\nof the j -th house wants to live on the left side of the street; otherwise,\na_j = 1 .\n\nThe road will pass between two houses. The houses to the left of it will be\ndeclared the left-side, and the houses to the right will be declared the\nright-side. More formally, let the road pass between houses i and i+1 . Then\nthe houses at positions between 1 and i will be on the left side of the\nstreet, and at positions between i+1 and n will be on the right side. The road\nalso may pass before the first and after the last house; in this case, the\nentire village is declared to be either the right or left side, respectively.\n\nTo make the design fair, it was decided to lay the road so that at least half\nof the residents on each side of the village are satisfied with the choice.\nThat is, among x residents on one side, at least \\lceil\\frac{x}{2}\\rceil\nshould want to live on that side, where \\lceil x \\rceil denotes rounding up a\nreal number x .\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/75baa17903d65a630fb0d3334683e857d5fdc345.png)\nTo the left of the road, there will be i houses, among the corresponding a_j\nthere must be at least \\lceil\\frac{i}{2}\\rceil zeros. To the right of the\nroad, there will be n-i houses, among the corresponding a_j there must be at\nleast \\lceil\\frac{n-i}{2}\\rceil ones.\n\nDetermine after which house i the road should be laid in order to satisfy the\ndescribed condition and be as close to the middle of the village as possible.\nFormally, among all suitable positions i , minimize \\left|\\frac{n}{2} -\ni\\right| .\n\nIf there are multiple suitable positions i with the minimum \\left|\\frac{n}{2}\n- i\\right| , output the smaller one.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of\ntest cases t (1 \\le t \\le 2\\cdot 10^4 ).

        "description": "In the village of Letovo, there are n houses. The villagers decided to build a\nbig road that will divide the village into left and right sides. Each resident\nwants to live on either the right or the left side of the street, which is\ndescribed as a sequence a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n , where a_j = 0 if the resident\nof the j -th house wants to live on the left side of the street; otherwise,\na_j = 1 .\n\nThe road will pass between two houses. The houses to the left of it will be\ndeclared the left-side, and the houses to the right will be declared the\nright-side. More formally, let the road pass between houses i and i+1 . Then\nthe houses at positions between 1 and i will be on the left side of the\nstreet, and at positions between i+1 and n will be on the right side. The road\nalso may pass before the first and after the last house; in this case, the\nentire village is declared to be either the right or left side, respectively.\n\nTo make the design fair, it was decided to lay the road so that at least half\nof the residents on each side of the village are satisfied with the choice.\nThat is, among x residents on one side, at least \\lceil\\frac{x}{2}\\rceil\nshould want to live on that side, where \\lceil x \\rceil denotes rounding up a\nreal number x .\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/75baa17903d65a630fb0d3334683e857d5fdc345.png)\nTo the left of the road, there will be i houses, among the corresponding a_j\nthere must be at least \\lceil\\frac{i}{2}\\rceil zeros. To the right of the\nroad, there will be n-i houses, among the corresponding a_j there must be at\nleast \\lceil\\frac{n-i}{2}\\rceil ones.\n\nDetermine after which house i the road should be laid in order to satisfy the\ndescribed condition and be as close to the middle of the village as possible.\nFormally, among all suitable positions i , minimize \\left|\\frac{n}{2} -\ni\\right| .\n\nIf there are multiple suitable positions i with the minimum \\left|\\frac{n}{2}\n- i\\right| , output the smaller one.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of\ntest cases t (1 \\le t \\le 2\\cdot 10^4 ). The description of the test cases\nfollows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \\le n \\le\n3\\cdot 10^5 ). The next line of each test case contains a string a of length n\n, consisting only of 0 and 1 .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3\\cdot\n10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single number i \u2014 the position of the house after\nwhich the road should be laid (if it should be laid before the first house,\noutput 0 ). We can show that the answer always exists.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    7\n    \n    3\n    \n    101\n    \n    6\n    \n    010111\n    \n    6\n    \n    011001\n    \n    3\n    \n    000\n    \n    3\n    \n    110\n    \n    3\n    \n    001\n    \n    4\n    \n    1100\n\nOutput\n\n    2\n    3\n    2\n    3\n    0\n    1\n    0\n    \nNote\n\nLet's consider the first example of input data.\n\nIf we lay the road after the first house, there will be one house a_1 = 1 on\nthe left side of the street, the resident of which would like to live on the\nright side of the street. Then 0 out of 1 residents on the even side will be\nsatisfied with the choice, which means that the road cannot be laid after\nhouse 1 .\n\nIf we lay the road after the second house, 1 out of 2 residents on the left\nside (with preferences a_1 = 1 , a_2 = 0 ) and 1 out of 1 resident on the\nright side (with preference a_3 = 1 ) will be satisfied with the choice. More\nthan half of the residents on each side are satisfied with the choice, which\nmeans that the road can be laid after house 2 . We can show that this is the\noptimal answer.",

        "description": "As soon as everyone in the camp fell asleep, Kirill sneaked out of the tent\nand went to the Wise Oak to gather mushrooms.\n\nIt is known that there are n mushrooms growing under the Oak, each of which\nhas magic power v_i . Kirill really wants to make a magical elixir of maximum\nstrength from the mushrooms.\n\nThe strength of the elixir is equal to the product of the number of mushrooms\nin it and the minimum magic power among these mushrooms. To prepare the\nelixir, Kirill will sequentially pick one mushroom growing under the Oak.\nKirill can gather mushrooms in any order.\n\nHowever, it's not that simple. The Wise Oak informed Kirill of a permutation\nof numbers p from 1 to n . If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic\npower of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_{k - 1} will become 0 .\nKirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir.\n\nYour task is to help Kirill gather mushrooms in such a way that he can brew\nthe elixir of maximum possible strength. However, Kirill is a little scared to\nstay near the oak for too long, so out of all the suitable options for\ngathering mushrooms, he asks you to find the one with the minimum number of\nmushrooms.\n\nA permutation of length n is an array consisting of n different integers from\n1 to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is\nnot a permutation (2 appears in the array twice) and [1,3,4] is also not a\npermutation (n=3 , but 4 appears in the array).\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of\nthe test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le\n200\\,000 ) \u2014 the number of mushrooms.\n\nThe second line contains an array v of size n (1\\le v_i \\le 10^9 ) \u2014 the magic\npowers of the mushrooms.\n\nThe third line contains a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not\nexceed 2\\cdot 10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output two integers separated by a space \u2014 the maximum\nstrength of the elixir that can be brewed and the minimum number of mushrooms\nthat Kirill needs to use for this.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    6\n    \n    3\n    \n    9 8 14\n    \n    3 2 1\n    \n    5\n    \n    1 2 3 4 5\n    \n    1 2 3 4 5\n    \n    6\n    \n    1 2 3 4 5 6\n    \n    6 5 4 3 2 1\n    \n    5\n    \n    1 4 6 10 10\n    \n    2 1 4 5 3\n    \n    4\n    \n    2 2 5 5\n    \n    4 2 3 1\n    \n    5\n    \n    1 2 9 10 10\n    \n    1 4 2 3 5\n\nOutput\n\n    16 2\n    9 3\n    8 2\n    20 2\n    5 1\n    20 2\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first example, you need to take the mushrooms with indices 1 and 2 , so\nthe strength of the elixir is equal to 2 \\cdot \\min(a_1, a_2) = 2 \\cdot\n\\min(9, 8) = 2 \\cdot 8 = 16 . Note that the magic power of the mushroom with\nindex 3 after picking two mushrooms will become 0 .",

Details of the index are\n        described in ``SortedList._build_index``.\n \n        Indexing requires traversing the tree to a leaf node. Each node has two\n        children which are easily computable. Given an index, pos, the\n        left-child is at ``pos * 2 + 1`` and the right-child is at ``pos * 2 +\n        2``.\n \n        When the index is less than the left-child, traversal moves to the\n        left sub-tree. Otherwise, the index is decremented by the left-child\n        and traversal moves to the right sub-tree.\n \n        At a child node, the indexing pair is computed from the relative\n        position of the child node as compared with the offset and the remaining\n        index.\n \n        For example, using the index from ``SortedList._build_index``::\n \n            _index = 14 5 9 3 2 4 5\n            _offset = 3\n \n        Tree::\n \n                 14\n              5      9\n            3   2  4   5\n \n        Indexing position 8 involves iterating like so:\n \n        1.

When greater the index is\n           decremented and the position is updated to the right child node.\n \n        2. At node 9 with index 3, we again compare the index to the left-child\n           node with value 4. Because the index is the less than the left-child\n           node, we simply traverse to the left.\n \n        3. At node 4 with index 3, we recognize that we are at a leaf node and\n           stop iterating.\n \n        4.

For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is\nnot a permutation (2 appears in the array twice) and [1,3,4] is also not a\npermutation (n=3 , but 4 appears in the array).\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of\nthe test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le\n200\\,000 ) \u2014 the number of mushrooms.\n\nThe second line contains an array v of size n (1\\le v_i \\le 10^9 ) \u2014 the magic\npowers of the mushrooms.\n\nThe third line contains a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not\nexceed 2\\cdot 10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output two integers separated by a space \u2014 the maximum\nstrength of the elixir that can be brewed and the minimum number of mushrooms\nthat Kirill needs to use for this.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    6\n    \n    3\n    \n    9 8 14\n    \n    3 2 1\n    \n    5\n    \n    1 2 3 4 5\n    \n    1 2 3 4 5\n    \n    6\n    \n    1 2 3 4 5 6\n    \n    6 5 4 3 2 1\n    \n    5\n    \n    1 4 6 10 10\n    \n    2 1 4 5 3\n    \n    4\n    \n    2 2 5 5\n    \n    4 2 3 1\n    \n    5\n    \n    1 2 9 10 10\n    \n    1 4 2 3 5\n\nOutput\n\n    16 2\n    9 3\n    8 2\n    20 2\n    5 1\n    20 2\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first example, you need to take the mushrooms with indices 1 and 2 , so\nthe strength of the elixir is equal to 2 \\cdot \\min(a_1, a_2) = 2 \\cdot\n\\min(9, 8) = 2 \\cdot 8 = 16 .

Cow i has a Cowdeforces\nrating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament\nconsists of n-1 matches as follows:\n\n  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . \n  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . \n  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. \n\nYou are the owner of cow k .

To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each\ncontaining an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each\nstall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .\n\nFortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,\nbuy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as\npossible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the\nnumber of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that\nAlice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is\nimpossible to do so.\n\nNote that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t\n(1 \\le t \\le 1000 ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test\ncases follows.\n\nEach test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \\le n, k \\le 10^{18}\n) \u2014 the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to\nhave bought at the end.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print on one line \"YES\" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls\nand set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or\n\"NO\" if it is impossible to do so.\n\nIf the answer is \"YES\", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \\le s \\le 60\n) \u2014 the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s\npositive integers p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_s (1 \\le p_i \\le 10^{18}) that represent\nsuch a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .\nIf there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    3\n    \n    7 3\n    \n    6 4\n    \n    255 8\n\nOutput\n\n    YES\n    10\n    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11\n    NO\n    YES\n    8\n    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left\nwith 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining\nstalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.\n\nIn the third test case,\n\n  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. \n  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. \n  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. \n  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. \n  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. \n  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. \n  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. \n  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. \n\nTherefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.",

However, Alice thinks that\nthis is too dull, so she wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob\ncannot make all parts have the same color.\n\nIs it possible to paint the ribbon in such a way?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \\le t \\le 1000 ) \u2014 the number of test\ncases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line containing three integers n , m and k (1\n\\le m, k \\le n \\le 50 ) \u2014 the number of parts, the number of colors and the\nnumber of parts Bob can repaint, respectively.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print YES if Alice can paint the ribbon so that Bob cannot\nmake all parts have the same color. Otherwise, print NO.\n\nYou can print every letter in any register. For example, Yes, yes, yEs will\nall be recognized as positive answer.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    5\n    \n    1 1 1\n    \n    5 1 1\n    \n    5 2 1\n    \n    5 2 2\n    \n    5 5 3\n\nOutput\n\n    NO\n    NO\n    YES\n    NO\n    YES\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, a ribbon consists of 1 part. So all its parts will\nalways have the same color.\n\nIn the second test case, there is only 1 color.\n\nIn the third test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]\n. It's impossible to change the color of at most 1 part so that all parts have\nthe same color.\n\nIn the fourth test case, no matter how Alice paints the ribbon, Bob will\nalways be able to repaint 2 parts so that all parts have the same color.\n\nIn the fifth test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n. It's impossible to change the color of at most 3 parts so that all parts\nhave the same color.",

        "description": "Nene invented a new game based on an increasing sequence of integers a_1, a_2,\n\\ldots, a_k .\n\nIn this game, initially n players are lined up in a row. In each of the rounds\nof this game, the following happens:\n\n  * Nene finds the a_1 -th, a_2 -th, \\ldots , a_k -th players in a row. They are kicked out of the game simultaneously. If the i -th player in a row should be kicked out, but there are fewer than i players in a row, they are skipped. \n\nOnce no one is kicked out of the game in some round, all the players that are\nstill in the game are declared as winners.\n\nFor example, consider the game with a=[3, 5] and n=5 players. Let the players\nbe named player A, player B, \\ldots , player E in the order they are lined up\ninitially. Then,\n\n  * Before the first round, players are lined up as ABCDE. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. These are players C and E. They are kicked out in the first round. \n  * Now players are lined up as ABD. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. The 3 -rd player is player D and there is no 5 -th player in a row. Thus, only player D is kicked out in the second round. \n  * In the third round, no one is kicked out of the game, so the game ends after this round. \n  * Players A and B are declared as the winners. \n\nNene has not yet decided how many people would join the game initially. Nene\ngave you q integers n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_q and you should answer the following\nquestion for each 1 \\le i \\le q independently:\n\n  * How many people would be declared as winners if there are n_i players in the game initially? \n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of\ntest cases t (1 \\le t \\le 250 ). The description of test cases follows.\n\nThe first line case contains two integers k and q (1 \\le k, q \\le 100 ) \u2014 the\nlength of the sequence a and the number of values n_i you should solve this\nproblem for.\n\nThe second line contains k integers a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_k (1\\leq\na_1<a_2<\\ldots<a_k\\leq 100 ) \u2014 the sequence a .\n\nThe third line contains q integers n_1,n_2,\\ldots,n_q (1\\leq n_i \\leq 100 ).\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output q integers: the i -th (1\\le i \\le q ) of them\nshould be the number of players declared as winners if initially n_i players\njoin the game.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    6\n    \n    2 1\n    \n    3 5\n    \n    5\n    \n    5 3\n    \n    2 4 6 7 9\n    \n    1 3 5\n    \n    5 4\n    \n    3 4 5 6 7\n    \n    1 2 3 4\n    \n    2 3\n    \n    69 96\n    \n    1 10 100\n    \n    1 1\n    \n    100\n    \n    50\n    \n    3 3\n    \n    10 20 30\n    \n    1 10 100\n\nOutput\n\n    2 \n    1 1 1 \n    1 2 2 2 \n    1 10 68 \n    50 \n    1 9 9 \n    \nNote\n\nThe first test case was explained in the statement.\n\nIn the second test case, when n=1 , the only player stays in the game in the\nfirst round.

On each turn,\ntwo things happen to each player:\n\n  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . \n  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . \n\nThe winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k\nturns.\n\nKnowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,\ndetermine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1\\le t\\le 10^4 ) \u2014 the number of\ntestcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\\le\nP_B,P_S\\le n\\le 2\\cdot 10^5 , 1\\le k\\le 10^9 ) \u2014 length of the permutation,\nduration of the game, starting positions respectively.\n\nThe next line contains n integers p_1,\\dots,p_n (1 \\le p_i \\le n ) \u2014 elements\nof the permutation p .\n\nThe next line contains n integers a_1,\\dots,a_n (1\\le a_i\\le 10^9 ) \u2014 elements\nof array a .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not\nexceed 2 \\cdot 10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase output:\n\n  * \"Bodya\" if Bodya wins the game. \n  * \"Sasha\" if Sasha wins the game. \n  * \"Draw\" if the players have the same score. \n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    10\n    \n    4 2 3 2\n    \n    4 1 2 3\n    \n    7 2 5 6\n    \n    10 8 2 10\n    \n    3 1 4 5 2 7 8 10 6 9\n    \n    5 10 5 1 3 7 10 15 4 3\n    \n    2 1000000000 1 2\n    \n    1 2\n    \n    4 4\n    \n    8 10 4 1\n    \n    5 1 4 3 2 8 6 7\n    \n    1 1 2 1 2 100 101 102\n    \n    5 1 2 5\n    \n    1 2 4 5 3\n    \n    4 6 9 4 2\n    \n    4 2 3 1\n    \n    4 1 3 2\n    \n    6 8 5 3\n    \n    6 9 5 4\n    \n    6 1 3 5 2 4\n    \n    6 9 8 9 5 10\n    \n    4 8 4 2\n    \n    2 3 4 1\n    \n    5 2 8 7\n    \n    4 2 3 1\n    \n    4 1 3 2\n    \n    6 8 5 3\n    \n    2 1000000000 1 2\n    \n    1 2\n    \n    1000000000 2\n\nOutput\n\n    Bodya\n    Sasha\n    Draw\n    Draw\n    Bodya\n    Sasha\n    Sasha\n    Sasha\n    Sasha\n    Bodya\n    \nNote\n\nBelow you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game\nconsists of k=2 turns.\n\nTurn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's\nscore| Sasha's move  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nfirst| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   \nsecond| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  \nfinal results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   \n  \nAs we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game.

The\nfriend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the\nfriend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.\n\nCalculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at\nleast 2  friends come to the party.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \\le t \\le 5000 ) \u2014 the number of test\ncases.\n\nEach test case consists of two lines:\n\n  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \\le n \\le 50 ) \u2014 the number of friends; \n  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n (1 \\le p_i \\le n ; p_i \\ne i ; all p_i are distinct). \n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    3\n    \n    5\n    \n    3 1 2 5 4\n    \n    4\n    \n    2 3 4 1\n    \n    2\n    \n    2 1\n\nOutput\n\n    2\n    3\n    2\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 .

Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2\nhave invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3\nwon't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to\nsend invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.\n\nIn the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,\nand both of them will attend.",

        "description": "This afternoon, you decided to enjoy the first days of Spring by taking a walk\noutside. As you come near the Quidditch field, you hear screams. Once again,\nthere is a conflict about the score: the two teams are convinced that they won\nthe game! To prevent this problem from happening one more time, you decide to\nget involved in the refereeing of the matches.\n\nNow, you will stay in the stadium to watch the game and count the score. At\nthe end of the game, you will decide the winner.\n\nToday, two teams are competing: the red Gryffindor (R) and the blue Ravenclaw\n(B) team. Each team is composed of P players (1 \\leq P \\leq 10 ).\n\nThe field is a rectangle of N lines and M columns (3 \\leq N, M \\leq 99 , N and\nM are odd). All the positions are integers, and several entities are allowed\nto be at the same position in the field. At the beginning of the game, the\nfield contains goals for the two teams (each team can own between one and five\ngoals), the players, and exactly one Quaffle. Other types of balls will be\navailable in the harder versions of the problem.\n\nA game is composed of T steps (0 \\leq T \\leq 10000 ). At each step, one entity\non the field (a player or a ball) performs one action. All entities can move.\nA player can also catch a ball or throw the Quaffle that it is carrying. To\ncatch a ball, a player must be located on the same cell as it. The Quaffle\ndoes not perform any action while it is being carried; it only follows the\nmovements of the player. If a player carrying the Quaffle decides to throw it,\nthe Quaffle is simply put at the current position of the player.\n\nTo win a point, a player must leave the Quaffle at a goal of the other team.\nWhen it does, the team of the player wins one point, and the Quaffle instantly\nmoves to the middle of the field (the cell at the (M+1)/2 -th column of the\n(N+1)/2 -th line of the field, starting from 1). There is no goal in the\nmiddle of the field. If a player puts the ball in its own goal, the other team\nwins the point.\n\nInput\n\nOn the first line, the integers N and M .\n\nThe description of the field follows: N lines of M pairs of characters\nseparated by spaces. Each pair of characters represents a position on the\nfield. It can be either:\n\n  * .. to represent an empty cell \n  * R0, ..., R9, B0, ..., B9 to represent a player. The first character is the team of the player, and the second is the number of the player in the team. Each pair of characters is unique, but it is not guaranteed that all the pairs appear in the grid. \n  * RG or BG to represent a goal. The blue team tries to put the ball in a red goal (RG) while the red team tries to put the ball in a blue goal (BG). \n  * .Q to represent the Quaffle, which is the ball that the players use to score goals. \n\nThe next line contains T , the number of steps that compose the game. T lines\nfollow, each describing one action. It contains several pieces of information\nseparated by a space. First, a pair of characters representing the entity that\nmust perform the action. Second, the description of the action:\n\n  * U, D, L, R indicate that the entity moves on the grid. It can move to the top of the grid (U), to the bottom (D), to the left (L), or to the right (R). Each entity moves by only one cell at a time. \n  * C indicates that the player catches the ball (only a player can catch a ball). Then, there is a space followed by a pair of characters: the description of the ball caught by the player. This information is needed since in the next versions of the problem, several balls may be in the same cell. \n  * T indicates that the player throws the Quaffle that it is carrying. \n\nAll the actions performed by the entities are guaranteed to be valid: the\nplayers stay in the field, don't catch a ball if they are not in the same\ncell, don't release the Quaffle if they are not carrying it, ...\n\nOutput\n\nYou must output the description of the main events of the game, one event per\nline. More precisely:\n\n  * Each time a team scores, you must print t RED GOAL or t BLUE GOAL, depending on the team who scored, where t is the current time (the position of the action in the list of actions, starting from 0). In the case where a player scores in the wrong goal (a red player scores in the red goal, or a blue player scores in the blue goal), you must print the name of the team who wins one point, that is, the other team. \n\nThe events must be printed in ascending order of t.\n\nAt the end of the game, you must print the final score as: FINAL SCORE: r b,\nwhere r is the score of the red team and b is the score of the blue team.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n    5 5\n    \n    ..

        "description": "This afternoon, you decided to enjoy the first days of Spring by taking a walk\noutside. As you come near the Quidditch field, you hear screams. Once again,\nthere is a conflict about the score: the two teams are convinced that they won\nthe game! To prevent this problem from happening one more time, you decide to\nget involved in the refereeing of the matches.\n\nNow, you will stay in the stadium to watch the game and count the score. At\nthe end of the game, you will decide the winner.\n\nToday, two teams are competing: the red Gryffindor (R) and the blue Ravenclaw\n(B) team. Each team is composed of P players (1 \\leq P \\leq 10 ).\n\nThe field is a rectangle of N lines and M columns (3 \\leq N, M \\leq 99 , N and\nM are odd). All the positions are integers, and several entities are allowed\nto be at the same position in the field. At the beginning of the game, the\nfield contains goals for the two teams (each team can own between one and five\ngoals), the players, and exactly one Quaffle. Other types of balls will be\navailable in the harder versions of the problem.\n\nA game is composed of T steps (0 \\leq T \\leq 10000 ). At each step, one entity\non the field (a player or a ball) performs one action. All entities can move.\nA player can also catch a ball or throw the Quaffle that it is carrying. To\ncatch a ball, a player must be located on the same cell as it. The Quaffle\ndoes not perform any action while it is being carried; it only follows the\nmovements of the player. If a player carrying the Quaffle decides to throw it,\nthe Quaffle is simply put at the current position of the player.\n\nTo win a point, a player must leave the Quaffle at a goal of the other team.\nWhen it does, the team of the player wins one point, and the Quaffle instantly\nmoves to the middle of the field (the cell at the (M+1)/2 -th column of the\n(N+1)/2 -th line of the field, starting from 1). There is no goal in the\nmiddle of the field. If a player puts the ball in its own goal, the other team\nwins the point.\n\nInput\n\nOn the first line, the integers N and M .\n\nThe description of the field follows: N lines of M pairs of characters\nseparated by spaces. Each pair of characters represents a position on the\nfield. It can be either:\n\n  * .. to represent an empty cell \n  * R0, ..., R9, B0, ..., B9 to represent a player. The first character is the team of the player, and the second is the number of the player in the team. Each pair of characters is unique, but it is not guaranteed that all the pairs appear in the grid. \n  * RG or BG to represent a goal. The blue team tries to put the ball in a red goal (RG) while the red team tries to put the ball in a blue goal (BG). \n  * .Q to represent the Quaffle, which is the ball that the players use to score goals. \n\nThe next line contains T , the number of steps that compose the game. T lines\nfollow, each describing one action. It contains several pieces of information\nseparated by a space. First, a pair of characters representing the entity that\nmust perform the action. Second, the description of the action:\n\n  * U, D, L, R indicate that the entity moves on the grid. It can move to the top of the grid (U), to the bottom (D), to the left (L), or to the right (R). Each entity moves by only one cell at a time. \n  * C indicates that the player catches the ball (only a player can catch a ball). Then, there is a space followed by a pair of characters: the description of the ball caught by the player. This information is needed since in the next versions of the problem, several balls may be in the same cell. \n  * T indicates that the player throws the Quaffle that it is carrying. \n\nAll the actions performed by the entities are guaranteed to be valid: the\nplayers stay in the field, don't catch a ball if they are not in the same\ncell, don't release the Quaffle if they are not carrying it, ...\n\nOutput\n\nYou must output the description of the main events of the game, one event per\nline. More precisely:\n\n  * Each time a team scores, you must print t RED GOAL or t BLUE GOAL, depending on the team who scored, where t is the current time (the position of the action in the list of actions, starting from 0). In the case where a player scores in the wrong goal (a red player scores in the red goal, or a blue player scores in the blue goal), you must print the name of the team who wins one point, that is, the other team. \n\nThe events must be printed in ascending order of t.\n\nAt the end of the game, you must print the final score as: FINAL SCORE: r b,\nwhere r is the score of the red team and b is the score of the blue team.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n    5 5\n    \n    ..

        "description": "This afternoon, you decided to enjoy the first days of Spring by taking a walk\noutside. As you come near the Quidditch field, you hear screams. Once again,\nthere is a conflict about the score: the two teams are convinced that they won\nthe game! To prevent this problem from happening one more time, you decide to\nget involved in the refereeing of the matches.\n\nNow, you will stay in the stadium to watch the game and count the score. At\nthe end of the game, you will decide the winner.\n\nToday, two teams are competing: the red Gryffindor (R) and the blue Ravenclaw\n(B) team. Each team is composed of P players (1 \\leq P \\leq 10 ).\n\nThe field is a rectangle of N lines and M columns (3 \\leq N, M \\leq 99 , N and\nM are odd). All the positions are integers, and several entities are allowed\nto be at the same position in the field. At the beginning of the game, the\nfield contains goals for the two teams (each team can own between one and five\ngoals), the players, and exactly one Quaffle. In this version of the problem,\none Bludger can be present. An other type of ball will be available in the\nharder version of the problem.\n\nA game is composed of T steps (0 \\leq T \\leq 10000 ). At each step, one entity\non the field (a player or a ball) performs one action. All entities can move.\nA player can also catch a ball or throw the Quaffle that it is carrying. To\ncatch a ball, a player must be located on the same cell as it. The Quaffle\ndoes not perform any action while it is being carried; it only follows the\nmovements of the player. If a player carrying the Quaffle decides to throw it,\nthe Quaffle is simply put at the current position of the player. If a player\nis on the same cell as a Bludger (either after a movement from the player or\nthe Bludger), the player is eliminated. If the player is eliminated while it\nis carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle remains on the cell containing both the\nplayer and the Bludger after the move. It is guaranteed that this never occurs\nwhile the player is in a cell containing a goal.\n\nTo win a point, a player must leave the Quaffle at a goal of the other team.\nWhen it does, the team of the player wins one point, and the Quaffle instantly\nmoves to the middle of the field (the cell at the (M+1)/2 -th column of the\n(N+1)/2 -th line of the field, starting from 1). There is no goal in the\nmiddle of the field. If a player puts the ball in its own goal, the other team\nwins the point.\n\nInput\n\nOn the first line, the integers N and M .\n\nThe description of the field follows: N lines of M pairs of characters\nseparated by spaces. Each pair of characters represents a position on the\nfield. It can be either:\n\n  * .. to represent an empty cell \n  * R0, ..., R9, B0, ..., B9 to represent a player. The first character is the team of the player, and the second is the number of the player in the team. Each pair of characters is unique, but it is not guaranteed that all the pairs appear in the grid. \n  * RG or BG to represent a goal. The blue team tries to put the ball in a red goal (RG) while the red team tries to put the ball in a blue goal (BG). \n  * .Q to represent the Quaffle, which is the ball that the players use to score goals. \n  * .B to represent a Bludger.\n\nThe next line contains T , the number of steps that compose the game. T lines\nfollow, each describing one action. It contains several pieces of information\nseparated by a space. First, a pair of characters representing the entity that\nmust perform the action. Second, the description of the action:\n\n  * U, D, L, R indicate that the entity moves on the grid. It can move to the top of the grid (U), to the bottom (D), to the left (L), or to the right (R). Each entity moves by only one cell at a time. \n  * C indicates that the player catches the ball (only a player can catch a ball). Then, there is a space followed by a pair of characters: the description of the ball caught by the player. This information is needed since several balls can be in the same cell. \n  * T indicates that the player throws the Quaffle that it is carrying. \n\nAll the actions performed by the entities are guaranteed to be valid: the\nplayers stay in the field, don't catch a ball if they are not in the same\ncell, don't release the Quaffle if they are not carrying it, ...\n\nOutput\n\nYou must output the description of the main events of the game, one event per\nline. More precisely:\n\n  * Each time a team scores, you must print t RED GOAL or t BLUE GOAL, depending on the team who scored, where t is the current time (the position of the action in the list of actions, starting from 0). In the case where a player scores in the wrong goal (a red player scores in the red goal, or a blue player scores in the blue goal), you must print the name of the team who wins one point, that is, the other team. \n  * Each time a player is eliminated, you must print t p ELIMINATED, where t is the current time and p is the player who is eliminated. The format to print the player is the same as in the input.\n\nThe events must be printed in ascending order of t. If several players are\neliminated at the same time, the events must be written in alphabetical order:\nB0, ..., B9, R0, ... R9.\n\nAt the end of the game, you must print the final score as: FINAL SCORE: r b,\nwhere r is the score of the red team and b is the score of the blue team.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n    3 5\n    \n    .. ..

        "description": "This afternoon, you decided to enjoy the first days of Spring by taking a walk\noutside. As you come near the Quidditch field, you hear screams. Once again,\nthere is a conflict about the score: the two teams are convinced that they won\nthe game! To prevent this problem from happening one more time, you decide to\nget involved in the refereeing of the matches.\n\nNow, you will stay in the stadium to watch the game and count the score. At\nthe end of the game, you will decide the winner.\n\nToday, two teams are competing: the red Gryffindor (R) and the blue Ravenclaw\n(B) team. Each team is composed of P players (1 \\leq P \\leq 10 ).\n\nThe field is a rectangle of N lines and M columns (3 \\leq N, M \\leq 99 , N and\nM are odd). All the positions are integers, and several entities are allowed\nto be at the same position in the field. At the beginning of the game, the\nfield contains goals for the two teams (each team can own between one and five\ngoals), the players, and exactly one Quaffle. In this version of the problem,\none Bludger can be present. An other type of ball will be available in the\nharder version of the problem.\n\nA game is composed of T steps (0 \\leq T \\leq 10000 ). At each step, one entity\non the field (a player or a ball) performs one action. All entities can move.\nA player can also catch a ball or throw the Quaffle that it is carrying. To\ncatch a ball, a player must be located on the same cell as it. The Quaffle\ndoes not perform any action while it is being carried; it only follows the\nmovements of the player. If a player carrying the Quaffle decides to throw it,\nthe Quaffle is simply put at the current position of the player. If a player\nis on the same cell as a Bludger (either after a movement from the player or\nthe Bludger), the player is eliminated. If the player is eliminated while it\nis carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle remains on the cell containing both the\nplayer and the Bludger after the move. It is guaranteed that this never occurs\nwhile the player is in a cell containing a goal.\n\nTo win a point, a player must leave the Quaffle at a goal of the other team.\nWhen it does, the team of the player wins one point, and the Quaffle instantly\nmoves to the middle of the field (the cell at the (M+1)/2 -th column of the\n(N+1)/2 -th line of the field, starting from 1). There is no goal in the\nmiddle of the field. If a player puts the ball in its own goal, the other team\nwins the point.\n\nInput\n\nOn the first line, the integers N and M .\n\nThe description of the field follows: N lines of M pairs of characters\nseparated by spaces. Each pair of characters represents a position on the\nfield. It can be either:\n\n  * .. to represent an empty cell \n  * R0, ..., R9, B0, ..., B9 to represent a player. The first character is the team of the player, and the second is the number of the player in the team. Each pair of characters is unique, but it is not guaranteed that all the pairs appear in the grid. \n  * RG or BG to represent a goal. The blue team tries to put the ball in a red goal (RG) while the red team tries to put the ball in a blue goal (BG). \n  * .Q to represent the Quaffle, which is the ball that the players use to score goals. \n  * .B to represent a Bludger.\n\nThe next line contains T , the number of steps that compose the game. T lines\nfollow, each describing one action. It contains several pieces of information\nseparated by a space. First, a pair of characters representing the entity that\nmust perform the action. Second, the description of the action:\n\n  * U, D, L, R indicate that the entity moves on the grid. It can move to the top of the grid (U), to the bottom (D), to the left (L), or to the right (R). Each entity moves by only one cell at a time. \n  * C indicates that the player catches the ball (only a player can catch a ball). Then, there is a space followed by a pair of characters: the description of the ball caught by the player. This information is needed since several balls can be in the same cell. \n  * T indicates that the player throws the Quaffle that it is carrying. \n\nAll the actions performed by the entities are guaranteed to be valid: the\nplayers stay in the field, don't catch a ball if they are not in the same\ncell, don't release the Quaffle if they are not carrying it, ...\n\nOutput\n\nYou must output the description of the main events of the game, one event per\nline. More precisely:\n\n  * Each time a team scores, you must print t RED GOAL or t BLUE GOAL, depending on the team who scored, where t is the current time (the position of the action in the list of actions, starting from 0). In the case where a player scores in the wrong goal (a red player scores in the red goal, or a blue player scores in the blue goal), you must print the name of the team who wins one point, that is, the other team. \n  * Each time a player is eliminated, you must print t p ELIMINATED, where t is the current time and p is the player who is eliminated. The format to print the player is the same as in the input.\n\nThe events must be printed in ascending order of t. If several players are\neliminated at the same time, the events must be written in alphabetical order:\nB0, ..., B9, R0, ... R9.\n\nAt the end of the game, you must print the final score as: FINAL SCORE: r b,\nwhere r is the score of the red team and b is the score of the blue team.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n    3 5\n    \n    .. ..

Then, B0 moves to the position of the Bludger: B0 is eliminated\ntoo.\n\nYou can find one more example in the easy version of the problem",

        "description": "This is an interactive problem.\n\nFox gave Cat two positive integers n and k . She has a hidden array a_1,\n\\ldots , a_n of length n , such that 1 \\leq a_i \\leq n for every i . Now they\nare going to play the following game:\n\nFor any two integers l, r such that 1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n , define f(l, r) =\n(r - l + 1) \\cdot \\max\\limits_{x=l}^r a_x . In other words, f(l, r) is equal\nto the maximum of the subarray a_l, \\ldots, a_r multiplied by its size.\n\nCat can ask Fox at most 2 n questions about the array. He will tell her two\nintegers l and x (1 \\leq l \\leq n, 1 \\leq x \\leq 10^9 ), and she will tell him\none integer p as the answer \u2014 the smallest positive integer r such that f(l,\nr) = x , or n+1 if no such r exists.\n\nNow, Cat needs to find the largest value m such that there exists a sequence\nc_1, \\ldots, c_{k-1} such that 1 \\leq c_1 < \\ldots < c_{k-1} < n and f(1, c_1)\n= f(c_1 + 1, c_2) = \\ldots = f(c_{k-1}+1, n) = m . If no such m exists, he\nshould indicate this and take -1 as the answer. Note that for k = 1 , m is\nalways equal to f(1, n) .\n\nIn other words, the goal is to find the largest m such that you can split the\narray into exactly k subarrays (k is the constant given to you in the\nbeginning of the interaction) so that all the subarrays have the product of\ntheir length and their maximum equal to m , or determine that no such m\nexists. Every element should belong in exactly one of the subarrays.\n\nCat doesn't know what he should do, so he asked you to play the game for him.\n\nInteraction\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger t (1 \\leq t \\leq 10^3 ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of\nthe test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1\n\\leq k \\leq n \\leq 10^4 ) \u2014 the length of the hidden array and the number of\nsubarrays in the desired split.\n\nNow you are allowed to make queries in the following way \u2014 print one line of\nthe form \"\\mathtt{?} \\ l \\ x \" (it must hold that 1 \\leq l \\leq n , 1 \\leq x\n\\leq 10^9 ) and you will receive the smallest integer r such that l \\leq r\n\\leq n and f(l, r) = x , or n + 1 if no such r exists.\n\nIf you want to print the answer, output \"\\mathtt{!} \\ m \" and you will recieve\n1 if your answer is correct and -1 otherwise. In the first case, the\ninteraction continues with the next test case. Note that printing the answer\ndoesn't count towards the number of queries made. Please note that you don't\nreceive the values for the next test case immediately, you will first have to\nread whether your answer to the last test case was correct.\n\nIf you receive the integer -1 at any moment, it means your program has made an\ninvalid query, exceeded the query limit, or gave an incorrect answer. Your\nprogram must terminate immediately to receive a Wrong Answer verdict.\nOtherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will\ncontinue to read from a closed stream.\n\nAfter printing a query, do not forget to output end of line and flush the\noutput. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; \n  * System.out.flush() in Java; \n  * flush(output) in Pascal; \n  * stdout.flush() in Python; \n  * see documentation for other languages. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the total sum of n over the test cases won't exceed 10^4\n.\n\nHacks\n\nThe format of the hacks should be the following: the first line should contain\none integer t (1 \\leq t \\leq 10^3 ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The\ndescription of the test cases should follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case should contain two integers n and k (1 \\leq k\n\\leq n \\leq 10^4 ) \u2014 the length of the array a and the number of subarrays you\nwant to split it into.\n\nThe second line should contain n integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n (1 \\leq a_i\n\\leq n ).\n\nThe sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\nCopy\n\n    3\n    1 1\n    \n    1\n    2 2\n    \n    1\n    \n    3\n    \n    1\n    6 3\n    \n    7\n    \n    2\n    \n    3\n    \n    6\n    \n    1\n\nOutput\n\nCopy\n\n    ! 1\n    \n    ? 1 1\n    \n    ? 2 1\n    \n    ! -1\n    \n    ? 1 9\n    \n    ? 1 6\n    \n    ? 3 6\n    \n    ? 4 6\n    \n    ! 6\n\nNote\n\nThe hidden arrays in the three testcases are [1] , [1, 2] and [1, 3, 6, 1, 2,\n1] . In the second testcase, no split satisfies the constraints, so the answer\nis -1 .\n\nThe answer for the first query of the third testcase is 7 since no valid r\nexists. For the second query of the third testcase, since 2 \\cdot \\max(1, 3) =\n6 , we will get 2 as the answer, since r = 1 doesn't satisfy the constraint.\n\nThe sample interaction guessed all three answers (1, -1 and 6 ) correctly, so\nit received 1 after each answer.",

The description of\nthe test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 50 )\n\u2014 the number of outcomes.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\\ldots,k_n (2\n\\le k_i \\le 20 ) \u2014 the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome\nturns out to be winning.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \\cdot\n10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as\nrequired. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\\ldots, x_n (1 \\le x_i \\le\n10^{9} ) \u2014 your bets on the outcomes.\n\nIt can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that\nsatisfies these constraints.\n\nIf there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    6\n    \n    3\n    \n    3 2 7\n    \n    2\n    \n    3 3\n    \n    5\n    \n    5 5 5 5 5\n    \n    6\n    \n    7 9 3 17 9 13\n    \n    3\n    \n    6 3 2\n    \n    5\n    \n    9 4 6 8 3\n\nOutput\n\n    27 41 12 \n    1 1 \n    -1\n    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 \n    -1\n    8 18 12 9 24\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on\nthe first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third\noutcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =\n80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back\n3 \\cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will\nreceive back 2 \\cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be\nwinning, you will receive back 7 \\cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are\nstrictly greater than 80 .\n\nIn the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.",

Outputting the answer does not count as\none of the n queries. After solving one test case, the program should\nimmediately move on to the next one.

The cube with\nindex f is his favorite.\n\nDmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value\na_i (1 \\le a_i \\le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing\norder of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same\nvalue, they can go in any order.\n\nAfter sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in\nwhether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have\nchanged after sorting).\n\nFor example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \\color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite\ncube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:\n\n  * After sorting a=[4, \\color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. \n  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \\color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \\le t \\le 1000 ) \u2014 the number of test\ncases.

The cube with\nindex f is his favorite.\n\nDmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value\na_i (1 \\le a_i \\le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing\norder of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same\nvalue, they can go in any order.\n\nAfter sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in\nwhether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have\nchanged after sorting).\n\nFor example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \\color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite\ncube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:\n\n  * After sorting a=[4, \\color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. \n  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \\color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \\le t \\le 1000 ) \u2014 the number of test\ncases.
