Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The array is already uniform, and removing any element will still result in a beautiful array.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing any of the middle elements (index 2 or 4) will make the array non-beautiful.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: A single-element array is trivially beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Removing the first three elements (indices 1, 2, 3) will make the array `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: A two-element array with identical elements is beautiful, and removing any element will still result in a beautiful array.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing the middle element (index 2) will make the array `[1, 1]`, which is not beautiful.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 2 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing any of the middle elements (index 2 or 3) will make the array non-beautiful.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 3 2 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing the element at index 3 will make the array `[1, 3, 3, 1]`, which is not beautiful.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 2 1 2 3 2 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Removing the elements at indices 3, 6, and 9 will make the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
**Explanation**: Removing all elements except the first and last will make the array `[1, 10]`, which is not beautiful.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 ... 1 (100000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: An array of 100,000 identical elements is beautiful, and removing any element will still result in a beautiful array.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 1 2 1 ... 1 2 1 (alternating 1 and 2, 100000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Explanation**: Removing all elements of one type (either 1 or 2) will make the array non-beautiful.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
10000
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
-1
...
-1 (10000 times)
```
**Explanation**: Each test case is a single-element array, which is beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including basic functionality and edge cases, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the solution.
