```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
? 0
1 0
! 2 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- The graph has 2 vertices, and 1 edge is removed. The sequence of queries and responses leads to finding a Hamiltonian path 2-1.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4

```
**Output**: 
```
? 99998
0 0
? 99997
1 2
...
! 100000 99999 ... 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- The graph has 100,000 vertices, and 99,998 edges are removed. This tests the scalability of the solution with the maximum possible number of vertices.

#### Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
? 2
0 0
? 1
1 3
? 0
2 1
! 3 1 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- The graph has 3 vertices, and 1 edge is removed. The sequence of queries and responses leads to finding a Hamiltonian path 3-1-2.

#### Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
? 4
0 0
? 3
0 0
? 2
1 5
? 1
2 4
? 0
3 1
! 5 4 1 2 3
```
**Explanation**: 
- The graph has 5 vertices, and 3 edges are removed. The sequence of queries and responses leads to finding a Hamiltonian path 5-4-1-2-3.

#### Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
2
3
```
**Output**: 
```
? 0
1 0
! 2 1
? 2
0 0
? 1
1 3
? 0
2 1
! 3 1 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- Two test cases are provided. The first test case has 2 vertices, and the second test case has 3 vertices. Each test case follows the sequence of queries and responses to find the Hamiltonian path.

#### Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
? 1
0 0
? 0
1 0
! 2 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- The graph has 2 vertices, and 1 edge is removed. This tests the edge case where the degree query does not find a vertex with the required degree initially.

#### Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
? 2
0 0
? 1
1 3
? 0
2 1
! 3 1 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- The graph has 3 vertices, and 1 edge is removed. This tests the case where the degree query finds a vertex with the required degree after some iterations.

#### Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
? 2
1 3
? 1
2 1
? 0
3 1
! 1 3 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- The graph has 3 vertices, and 1 edge is removed. This tests the case where the degree query finds a vertex with the required degree immediately.

### Conclusion
These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases, and scalability. Each test case is designed to ensure the robustness and reliability of the solution.
