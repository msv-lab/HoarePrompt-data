Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 5
5 10 15 20 26
11 14 16 13 8
16 4 5 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: The initial imbalance is 6 (between 20 and 26). By adding a problem with complexity 13 (from model 4 and function 4), the new sequence becomes 5, 10, 13, 15, 20, 26, and the imbalance is reduced to 5.
