**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple triangle. Starting at node 3, Ron can move to node 1 or node 2. If Ron moves to node 1, Hermione can move to node 2, and Ron has no more moves. If Ron moves to node 2, Hermione can move to node 1, and Ron has no more moves. In both cases, Ron loses, but since Ron moves first, he wins if he plays optimally by moving to node 1 or node 2.

Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a straight line. Starting at node 5, Ron can only move to node 4. Hermione then moves to node 3, Ron to node 2, and Hermione to node 1. Hermione wins because Ron cannot make a move after Hermione moves to node 1.

Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a straight line. Starting at node 2, Ron can move to node 1 or node 3. If Ron moves to node 1, Hermione can move to node 3, and Ron to node 4. Hermione wins. If Ron moves to node 3, Hermione can move to node 1, and Ron to node 4. Hermione wins. In both cases, Hermione wins.

**Explanation**: The tree is a straight line. Starting at node 3, Ron can move to node 2 or node 4. If Ron moves to node 2, Hermione can move to node 1, and Ron to node 4. Hermione wins. If Ron moves to node 4, Hermione can move to node 2, and Ron to node 1. Hermione wins. In both cases, Hermione wins.

# Test 6

**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a single edge. Starting at node 1, Ron can only move to node 2. Hermione has no moves left, so Ron wins.

**Explanation**: The tree is a straight line. Starting at node 1, Ron can only move to node 2. Hermione then moves to node 3, Ron to node 4, Hermione to node 5, Ron to node 6, Hermione to node 7, Ron to node 8, Hermione to node 9, and Ron to node 10. Hermione wins because Ron cannot make a move after Hermione moves to node 10.

**Explanation**: The tree is a straight line. Starting at node 10, Ron can only move to node 9. Hermione then moves to node 8, Ron to node 7, Hermione to node 6, Ron to node 5, Hermione to node 4, Ron to node 3, Hermione to node 2, and Ron to node 1. Hermione wins because Ron cannot make a move after Hermione moves to node 1.

**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a straight line with 200,000 nodes. Starting at node 1, Ron can only move to node 2. Hermione then moves to node 3, Ron to node 4, and so on. Hermione wins because Ron cannot make a move after Hermione moves to node 200,000. This tests the scalability of the solution with a large input size.
