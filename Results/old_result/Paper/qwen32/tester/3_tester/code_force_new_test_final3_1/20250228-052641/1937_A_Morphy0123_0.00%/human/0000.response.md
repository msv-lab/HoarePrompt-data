```
1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
**Explanation**: 
The array changes as follows:

- After swap(3), a becomes [2,3,1,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].
- After swap(4), a becomes [2,3,4,1,5,6,7,8,9,10].
- After swap(5), a becomes [2,3,4,5,1,6,7,8,9,10].
- After swap(6), a becomes [2,3,4,5,6,1,7,8,9,10].
- After swap(7), a becomes [2,3,4,5,6,7,1,8,9,10].
- After swap(8), a becomes [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,1,9,10].
- After swap(9), a becomes [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,10].
- After swap(10), a becomes [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,9,1].
The element 1 is at position 8.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
100
```
**Output**: 
```
64
```
**Explanation**: 
The array changes as follows:
- The element 1 will be swapped to the position of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 100, which is 64.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
536870912
```
**Explanation**: 
The element 1 will be swapped to the position of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 1000000000, which is 536870912.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
3
1
2
3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
2
3
```
**Explanation**: 
- For n=1, the output is 1.
- For n=2, the output is 2.
- For n=3, the output is 3.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
3
1000000000
1000000000
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
536870912
536870912
536870912
```
**Explanation**: 
- For each n=1000000000, the output is 536870912.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the solution.
