**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 7
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Sasha can win by placing bets of 1 coin if he won the previous bet or 2 coins if he lost the previous bet. Since he cannot lose more than once in a row, he can always recover and increase his coins.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Sasha starts with 1 coin and can only bet 1 coin. If he loses, he will have 0 coins and cannot place any more bets.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3 15
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Sasha can use a strategy to ensure he can recover from up to 3 consecutive losses. He can start with small bets and increase them carefully to ensure he can always recover.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 6
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Sasha starts with 6 coins and needs to ensure he can recover from up to 3 consecutive losses. The strategy is not feasible with the given initial coins and multiplier.
