**Input**: 
```
1
1 4 1 3 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Neither player can move, resulting in a draw.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 1 4 5 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice can only move down, and Bob can only move up. They cannot meet, and eventually, Alice will be stuck at the bottom row, resulting in a draw.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 1 1 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice can only move down-right, down, or down-left, and Bob can only move up-right, up, or up-left. They cannot meet, and the game will end in a draw.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 1 6 10 8
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can move down-right to (2, 7) and continue moving towards Bob's position, who is stuck at the top row.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 2 6 10 7
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice can move down, down-right, or down-left, but Bob can always move up, up-right, or up-left to avoid Alice. The game will end in a draw.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 9 1 8 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice can move down, but Bob can move up, and they cannot meet. Alice will eventually be stuck at the bottom row, resulting in a draw.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 8 1 10 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Alice can move down to (9, 1), and Bob can move up-right to (9, 2). Bob can then move to (8, 2) and win.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 1 1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can move down to (2, 1) and win immediately since Bob is already in the row above her.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 1 3 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can move down-right to (2, 4) and continue moving towards Bob's position, who is stuck at the top row.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 3 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice can only move down, and Bob can only move up. They cannot meet, and the game will end in a draw.

**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice and Bob cannot move, resulting in a draw.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 1 1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice can move down-right to (2, 2), and Bob can move up-left to (1, 1). They will meet, but since they move simultaneously, the game will end in a draw.

# Test 15

```
1
1000000 1000000000 1 1 1000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice and Bob are at opposite corners of a very large board. They cannot meet, and the game will end in a draw.

# Test 16

```
1
1000000 1000000000 1 1000000000 1000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice and Bob are at opposite corners of a very large board. They cannot meet, and the game will end in a draw.

# Test 17

```
1
1000000 1000000000 1 500000000 1000000 500000000
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```

1000000 1000000000 1 500000000 2 500000000
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can move down to (2, 500000000) and win immediately since Bob is already in the row below her.

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1000000000 999999 1 1000000 1000000000
