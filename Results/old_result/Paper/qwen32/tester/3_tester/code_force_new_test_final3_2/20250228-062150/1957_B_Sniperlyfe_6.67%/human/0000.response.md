Sure, here are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios:

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: Only one integer is needed, so the entire sum (5) is assigned to it. The binary representation of 5 is `101`, which has 2 ones.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 3 and we need two integers. Assigning 1 and 2 achieves the sum and maximizes the number of ones in the binary representation of `1 | 2 = 3` which is `11` in binary.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5 0
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 5 and we need two integers. Assigning 5 and 0 achieves the sum and maximizes the number of ones in the binary representation of `5 | 0 = 5` which is `101` in binary.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 51
```
**Output**: 
```
3 1 1 32 2 12
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 51 and we need six integers. The provided output is one of the many valid solutions that sums to 51 and maximizes the number of ones in the binary representation of `3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 47` which is `101111` in binary.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Only one integer is needed, so the entire sum (1) is assigned to it. The binary representation of 1 is `1`, which has 1 one.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Only one integer is needed, so the entire sum (2) is assigned to it. The binary representation of 2 is `10`, which has 1 one.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 0
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 1 and we need two integers. Assigning 1 and 0 achieves the sum and maximizes the number of ones in the binary representation of `1 | 0 = 1` which is `1` in binary.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 3 and we need three integers. Assigning 1, 1, and 1 achieves the sum and maximizes the number of ones in the binary representation of `1 | 1 | 1 = 1` which is `1` in binary.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3 6
```
**Output**: 
```
2 2 2
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 6 and we need three integers. Assigning 2, 2, and 2 achieves the sum and maximizes the number of ones in the binary representation of `2 | 2 | 2 = 2` which is `10` in binary.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1023
```
**Output**: 
```
512 256 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 1023 and we need ten integers. Assigning powers of 2 from 1 to 512 achieves the sum and maximizes the number of ones in the binary representation of `512 | 256 | 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 = 1023` which is `1111111111` in binary.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
