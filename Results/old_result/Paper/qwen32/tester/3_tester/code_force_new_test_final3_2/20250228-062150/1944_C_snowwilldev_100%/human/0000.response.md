Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem. We'll cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the solution is robust, reliable, and scalable.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1
0
```
**Explanation**: This is the example provided in the problem statement.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick elements in a way that all elements from 0 to 4 are included in `c`, resulting in MEX = 5.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
4 4 4 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice can only pick 4s, and Bob will remove them, leaving `c` empty, resulting in MEX = 0.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: Similar to Test 2, all elements from 0 to 5 are included in `c`, resulting in MEX = 6.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks 0, leaving `c` as [0], resulting in MEX = 1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks 1, leaving `c` as [1], resulting in MEX = 0.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks 0, then Bob picks 0, leaving `c` as [0], resulting in MEX = 1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks 1, then Bob picks 1, leaving `c` as [1], resulting in MEX = 0.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Alice and Bob can pick elements in a way that all elements from 0 to 2 are included in `c`, resulting in MEX = 3.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks 2, then Bob picks 2, and Alice picks 2, leaving `c` as [2, 2, 2], resulting in MEX = 0.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
4
3 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks 3, then Bob picks 3, and so on, leaving `c` as [3, 3, 3, 3], resulting in MEX = 0.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... 99998 99999
```
**Output**: 
```
100000
```
**Explanation**: Alice and Bob can pick elements in a way that all elements from 0 to 99999 are included in `c`, resulting in MEX = 100000.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
99999 99999 99999 ... 99999 99999
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks 99999, then Bob picks 99999, and so on, leaving `c` as [99999, 99999, ...], resulting in MEX = 0.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including small arrays, large arrays, arrays with all identical elements, and arrays with all distinct elements. They should help ensure the solution is robust and handles edge cases effectively.
