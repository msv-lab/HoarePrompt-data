0 1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The lengths of the sticks are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32. The only valid triangles are (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 8), (1, 4, 8), (2, 4, 8), (1, 2, 16), (1, 4, 16), (2, 4, 16), (1, 2, 32), (1, 4, 32), (2, 4, 32).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The lengths of the sticks are 2, 4, and 8. These cannot form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The lengths of the sticks are 2, 2, and 8. These cannot form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The lengths of the sticks are 2, 4, 8, 16. The valid triangles are (2, 4, 8), (2, 8, 16), (4, 8, 16).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one stick, so it is impossible to form a triangle.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are only two sticks, so it is impossible to form a triangle.

# Test 11
