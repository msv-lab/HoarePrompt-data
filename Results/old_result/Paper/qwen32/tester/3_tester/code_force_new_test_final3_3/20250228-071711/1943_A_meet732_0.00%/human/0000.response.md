Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the described problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick 1, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 0, and Bob picks 1. The final array `c` is `[1, 0]`, and the MEX is 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick 0, Bob picks 1, Alice picks 2, and Bob picks 3. The final array `c` is `[0, 2]`, and the MEX is 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks 1, Bob picks 1. The final array `c` is `[1]`, and the MEX is 0.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks 0. The final array `c` is `[0]`, and the MEX is 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks 1. The final array `c` is `[1]`, and the MEX is 0.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick 0, Bob picks 1, Alice picks 2, Bob picks 3, Alice picks 4. The final array `c` is `[0, 2, 4]`, and the MEX is 1. However, if Alice picks 1 first, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 2, Bob picks 3, Alice picks 4, the final array `c` is `[1, 2, 4]`, and the MEX is 0. But if Alice picks 2 first, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 1, Bob picks 3, Alice picks 4, the final array `c` is `[2, 1, 4]`, and the MEX is 0. The optimal strategy for Alice is to pick 2 first, resulting in a MEX of 2.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
6
0 0 1 1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick 1, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 2, Bob picks 1, Alice picks 0, Bob picks 2. The final array `c` is `[1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 2]`, and the MEX is 3.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
7
0 0 0 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick 1, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 2, Bob picks 1, Alice picks 0, Bob picks 1, Alice picks 0. The final array `c` is `[1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]`, and the MEX is 3.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
8
0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick 1, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 1, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 1, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 1, Bob picks 0. The final array `c` is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, and the MEX is 2.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick 1, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 1, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 1, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 1, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 1, Bob picks 0. The final array `c` is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, and the MEX is 2.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... 99999
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Explanation**: This is a large input test case where Alice and Bob play optimally. The MEX of the final array `c` will be 50000, as the array `c` will contain all numbers from 0 to 99999 except for 50000.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
0 0 0 ... 0 (100000 zeros)
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick 0, Bob picks 0, and so on. The final array `c` will contain all 0s, and the MEX is 1.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
99999 99998 99997 ... 0
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Explanation**: This is a large input test case where Alice and Bob play optimally. The MEX of the final array `c` will be 50000, as the array `c` will contain all numbers from 0 to 99999 except for 50000.

# Test 14
