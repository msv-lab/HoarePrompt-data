Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
2 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3 5 4 9
```
**Explanation**: This is a simple test case from the example. The array `a = [3, 5, 4, 9]` satisfies the conditions.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2 5 11
```
**Explanation**: Another example test case where `a = [2, 5, 11]` satisfies the conditions.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
6
4 2 5 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
5 14 16 5 11 24
```
**Explanation**: An example with a larger array where `a = [5, 14, 16, 5, 11, 24]` satisfies the conditions.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2
500
```
**Output**: 
```
501 500
```
**Explanation**: The smallest possible `a_1` that is greater than `x_2` is `501`, and `a_2` is `500`.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 5
```
**Output**: 
```
2 7 5
```
**Explanation**: Here, `a = [2, 7, 5]` satisfies the conditions.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
```
**Explanation**: The smallest possible `a_1` that is greater than `x_2` is `2`, and `a_2` is `1`.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
500
```
**Output**: 
```
501 500
```
**Explanation**: The smallest possible `a_1` that is greater than `x_2` is `501`, and `a_2` is `500`.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
500
1 1 1 ... 1 1 (500-1 ones)
```
**Output**: 
```
2 5 5 5 ... 5 5 (500 fives)
```
**Explanation**: All `x_i` are `1`, so `a_1` can be `2` and all other `a_i` can be `5`.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
500
500 500 500 ... 500 500 (500-1 fives)
```
**Output**: 
```
501 500 500 ... 500 500 (500 fives)
```
**Explanation**: All `x_i` are `500`, so `a_1` can be `501` and all other `a_i` can be `500`.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
499 498 497
```
**Output**: 
```
500 999 1497
```
**Explanation**: `a_1` is `500`, `a_2` is `999` (since `999 % 500 = 499`), and `a_3` is `1497` (since `1497 % 999 = 498`).

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2 3 5
```
**Explanation**: `a_1` is `2`, `a_2` is `3` (since `3 % 2 = 1`), and `a_3` is `5` (since `5 % 3 = 2`).

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
10000
2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
2 1
2 1
...
2 1 (10000 times)
```
**Explanation**: A large number of test cases where each test case is the same as Test 6. This tests the scalability of the solution.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
2 3 5 9 14
```
**Explanation**: `a_1` is `2`, `a_2` is `3` (since `3 % 2 = 1`), `a_3` is `5` (since `5 % 3 = 2`), `a_4` is `9` (since `9 % 5 = 4`), and `a_5` is `14` (since `14 % 9 = 5`).

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
6 14 17 19 20
```
**Explanation**: `a_1` is `6`, `a_2` is `14` (since `14 % 6 = 2`), `a_3` is `17` (since `17 % 14 = 3`), `a_4` is `19` (since `19 % 17 = 2`), and `a_5` is `20` (since `20 % 19 = 1`).

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases, and large input sizes.
