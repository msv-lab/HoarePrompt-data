**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 1
1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The simplest case with only two cities, where the closest city is the other city itself.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 10 20
3
1 3
2 1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
10
10
10
```
**Explanation**: Cities are evenly spaced, and the closest city for each city is the next or previous city, but the direct distance is cheaper than using the closest city repeatedly.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 1 100 200
3
1 4
2 3
3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
199
99
101
```
**Explanation**: Cities are not evenly spaced, and the direct distance is cheaper than using the closest city repeatedly.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
1 5
2 4
3 1
4 2
5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
4
2
2
2
2
```
**Explanation**: Cities are very close to each other, and the closest city for each city is the next or previous city, making the closest city option very effective.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
13
5
5
13
```
**Explanation**: Cities are spaced out, and the closest city option is effective for some queries, but direct distance is cheaper for others.

```
90
80
70
60
50
50
60
70
80

```
**Explanation**: Cities are spaced out evenly, and the closest city option is effective for some queries, but direct distance is cheaper for others.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 1000000000 2000000000 3000000000 4000000000

2999999999
1000000001
2999999999
3999999999
```
**Explanation**: Cities are spaced out with large distances, and the closest city option is effective for some queries, but direct distance is cheaper for others.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 3 ... 100000
1
1 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
99999
```
**Explanation**: A large number of cities with very small distances between them, testing the scalability of the solution.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1000000000 2000000000 ... 99999000000000000

```
**Output**: 
```
99998000000000000
```
**Explanation**: A large number of cities with large distances between them, testing the scalability of the solution.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios including small inputs, large inputs, evenly spaced cities, and widely spaced cities, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the solution.
