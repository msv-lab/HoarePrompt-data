# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 10, which is divisible by 4, but it's impossible to make all containers have 2.5 units of water (not an integer).

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers already have equal water levels.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 21, which is divisible by 6, but it's impossible to make all containers have 3.5 units of water (not an integer).

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... 1 (100000 ones)
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers already have equal water levels.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... 0 (100000 zeros)
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers already have equal water levels.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1000000000 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... 0 (one 10^9 and 99999 zeros)
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 10^9, which is divisible by 100000, but it's impossible to make all containers have 10^7 units of water with the given operation constraints.
