Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 0
2 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice buys the second item (cost 1 to Alice, 2 to Bob). Bob takes it for free. Alice's profit is 2 - 1 = 1.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1
1 2 1 4
3 3 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice buys items 1, 2, and 3 (cost 1+2+1=4 to Alice, 3+3+2=8 to Bob). Bob takes item 1 for free, and pays for items 2 and 3. Alice's profit is 8 - 4 = 4, but Bob can minimize it by taking item 2 for free, resulting in a profit of 5 - 4 = 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
2 1 1 1
4 2 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice buys items 2, 3, and 4 (cost 1+1+1=3 to Alice, 2+3+2=7 to Bob). Bob takes items 2 and 3 for free, and pays for item 4. Alice's profit is 2 - 3 = -1, but Bob can minimize it by taking items 3 and 4 for free, resulting in a profit of 0.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
1 3 4 9 1 3
7 6 8 10 6 8
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: Alice buys items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (cost 1+3+4+9+1+3=21 to Alice, 7+6+8+10+6+8=45 to Bob). Bob takes items 1 and 2 for free, and pays for items 3, 4, 5, and 6. Alice's profit is 45 - 21 = 24, but Bob can minimize it by taking items 3 and 4 for free, resulting in a profit of 27 - 21 = 6. The optimal strategy for Alice is to buy items 4, 5, and 6, and Bob takes items 5 and 6 for free, resulting in a profit of 16 - 14 = 2. The optimal strategy for Alice is to buy items 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and Bob takes items 2 and 3 for free, resulting in a profit of 34 - 18 = 16, but Bob can minimize it by taking items 4 and 5 for free, resulting in a profit of 22 - 18 = 4. The optimal strategy for Alice is to buy items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and Bob takes items 1 and 2 for free, resulting in a profit of 45 - 21 = 24, but Bob can minimize it by taking items 4 and 5 for free, resulting in a profit of 27 - 21 = 6. The optimal strategy for Alice is to buy items 4, 5, and 6, and Bob takes items 5 and 6 for free, resulting in a profit of 16 - 9 = 7.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice buys the only item (cost 1 to Alice, 2 to Bob). Bob takes it for free. Alice's profit is 2 - 1 = 1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice buys the only item (cost 1 to Alice, 2 to Bob). Bob takes it for free. Alice's profit is 0.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice buys all items (cost 5 to Alice, 5 to Bob). Bob takes all items for free. Alice's profit is 0.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
5 0
1 2 3 4 5
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: Alice buys all items (cost 15 to Alice, 15 to Bob). Bob takes no items for free. Alice's profit is 15 - 15 = 0, but Bob can minimize it by taking no items for free, resulting in a profit of 15 - 15 = 0. The optimal strategy for Alice is to buy items 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1, and Bob takes no items for free, resulting in a profit of 15 - 15 = 0. The optimal strategy for Alice is to buy items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and Bob takes no items for free, resulting in a profit of 15 - 15 = 0. The optimal strategy for Alice is to buy items 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1, and Bob takes no items for free, resulting in a profit of 15 - 5 = 10.
