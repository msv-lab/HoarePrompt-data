Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem. We'll cover both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The array is already sorted, and 3 is at the correct position after binary search.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 5
3 1 6 5 2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1
3 4
```
*Explanation*: Swapping elements at positions 3 and 4 (6 and 5) makes the array [3, 1, 5, 6, 2, 4], and binary search will find 5 correctly.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1
3 5 4 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2 4
1 5
```
*Explanation*: Swapping elements at positions 2 and 4 (5 and 2) then 1 and 5 (3 and 1) makes the array [1, 2, 4, 5, 3], and binary search will find 1 correctly.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
**Output**: 
```
2
4 5
2 4
```
*Explanation*: Swapping elements at positions 4 and 5 (5 and 2) then 2 and 4 (3 and 2) makes the array [4, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6], and binary search will find 3 correctly.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
4 5
2 4
```
*Explanation*: Swapping elements at positions 1 and 2 (3 and 2) makes the array [2, 3, 1], and binary search will find 2 correctly.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Single element array, no need for swaps.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 2
```
*Explanation*: Swapping elements at positions 1 and 2 (2 and 1) makes the array [1, 2], and binary search will find 1 correctly.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The array is already sorted, and 2 is at the correct position after binary search.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
3 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The array is already sorted, and 3 is at the correct position after binary search.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
2 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 3
```
*Explanation*: Swapping elements at positions 1 and 3 (2 and 1) makes the array [1, 3, 2], and binary search will find 1 correctly.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10 5
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 6
6 10
```
*Explanation*: Swapping elements at positions 1 and 6 (10 and 5) then 6 and 10 (5 and 1) makes the array [5, 9, 8, 7, 6, 10, 4, 3, 2, 1], and binary search will find 5 correctly.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
2
2 1
2 1
2 2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 2
0
```
*Explanation*: First test case requires a swap, second test case is already sorted.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 100000
200000 199999 ... 100001 100000 99999 ... 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 100000
100000 200000
```
*Explanation*: Large input, requires two swaps to bring 100000 to the correct position.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 1
200000 199999 ... 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 200000
```
*Explanation*: Large input, requires one swap to bring 1 to the correct position.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 200000
200000 199999 ... 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Large input, already sorted, no swaps needed.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases with small inputs, and large inputs to test scalability.
