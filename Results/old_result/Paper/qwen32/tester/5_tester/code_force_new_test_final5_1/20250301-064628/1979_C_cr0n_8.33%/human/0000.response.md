Sure, let's create comprehensive test cases for the given problem. We'll start with basic test cases and then move on to edge cases.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
3 2 7
```
**Output**: 
```
27 41 12
```
**Explanation**: This is a simple case with three outcomes. The bets can be distributed as 27, 41, and 12 to ensure that the total bet (80) is less than the received coins for any winning outcome.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
```
**Explanation**: With two outcomes having the same multiplier, betting 1 coin on each outcome suffices as the total bet (2) is less than the received coins for any winning outcome.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
9 4 6 8 3
```
**Output**: 
```
8 18 12 9 24
```
**Explanation**: This test case involves five outcomes with varying multipliers. The bets are distributed to ensure the total bet (71) is less than the received coins for any winning outcome.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This is the minimum possible test case with only one outcome. Betting 1 coin ensures that the total bet (1) is less than the received coins (2).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
50
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: With all multipliers being 2, it's impossible to distribute the bets such that the total bet is less than the received coins for any winning outcome.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
50
20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: With all multipliers being 20, it's impossible to distribute the bets such that the total bet is less than the received coins for any winning outcome.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
50
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case involves a mix of multipliers. Betting 1 coin on each outcome ensures that the total bet (50) is less than the received coins for any winning outcome with a multiplier greater than 2.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
50
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2
```
**Explanation**: With 49 multipliers of 2 and 1 multiplier of 3, betting 1 coin on each of the first 49 outcomes and 2 coins on the last outcome ensures that the total bet (50) is less than the received coins for the last winning outcome.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
10000
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1

1
```
**Explanation**: This test case involves 10,000 test cases, each with only one outcome having a multiplier of 2. Betting 1 coin on each outcome ensures that the total bet (1) is less than the received coins (2).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
10000
50
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

```
**Explanation**: This test case involves 10,000 test cases, each with 50 outcomes having varying multipliers. Betting 1 coin on each outcome ensures that the total bet (50) is less than the received coins for any winning outcome with a multiplier greater than 2.
