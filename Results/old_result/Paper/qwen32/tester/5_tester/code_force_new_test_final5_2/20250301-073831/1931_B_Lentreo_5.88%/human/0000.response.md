### Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
43
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Only one container, so it's trivially possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

### Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 4, which is divisible by 2, but we cannot move water from the second container to the first container to make them equal.

### Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can redistribute the water to make all containers have 3 units of water.

### Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 6, which is divisible by 3, but we cannot redistribute the water to make all containers have 2 units of water.

### Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 28, which is divisible by 7, but we cannot redistribute the water to make all containers have 4 units of water.

### Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can redistribute the water to make all containers have 4 units of water.

### Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Both containers are already empty, so they trivially have the same amount of water.

### Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers are already empty, so they trivially have the same amount of water.

### Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Both containers already have the same amount of water.

### Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers already have the same amount of water.

### Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 10, which is not divisible by 4, but since the problem guarantees divisibility, this is an invalid test case. However, if we assume divisibility, it's impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

### Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 1 1 9
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can redistribute the water to make all containers have 3 units of water.

### Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can redistribute the water to make all containers have 2 units of water.

### Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 ... 1 100000  (100000 ones and one 100000)
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can redistribute the water to make all containers have 2 units of water.

### Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
100000 1 1 ... 1 1  (one 100000 and 99999 ones)
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can redistribute the water to make all containers have 2 units of water.

### Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Both containers already have the same amount of water.

### Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1000000000 0 2000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can redistribute the water to make all containers have 1000000000 units of water.

### Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1000000000 1000000000 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can redistribute the water to make all containers have 666666666.6666666 units of water, but since we can only pour whole units, it's impossible, so the correct answer is NO.

### Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1000000000 1000000000 2000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can redistribute the water to make all containers have 1333333333.3333333 units of water, but since we can only pour whole units, it's impossible, so the correct answer is NO.

### Test 20
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000000 2000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 3000000000, which is divisible by 2, but we cannot move water from the second container to the first container to make them equal.
