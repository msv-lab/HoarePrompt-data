Splitting into three arrays of length 2, 1, and 2 would result in a penalty of 4 + 1 + 4 = 9. Splitting into five arrays of length 1 each would result in a penalty of 5.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5
-----
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: Five '-' characters results in a single array of length 5 with sum -5, penalty is 25. Splitting into two arrays of length 2 and 3 would result in a penalty of 4 + 9 = 13. Splitting into three arrays of length 2, 1, and 2 would result in a penalty of 4 + 1 + 4 = 9. Splitting into five arrays of length 1 each would result in a penalty of 5.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
--+++++++-
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: Ten characters with a mix of '+' and '-' results in an optimal split that minimizes the penalty to 4.

```
1
5000
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
```
**Output**: 
```
5000
```
**Explanation**: Fifty hundred '+' characters results in a single array of length 5000 with sum 5000, penalty is 2,500,000. Splitting into smaller arrays would increase the penalty.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
