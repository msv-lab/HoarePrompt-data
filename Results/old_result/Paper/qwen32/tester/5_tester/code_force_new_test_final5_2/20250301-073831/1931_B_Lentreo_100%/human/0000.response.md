Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
43
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Single container with any amount of water is trivially balanced.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 4, which is divisible by 2, but the amounts cannot be made equal by pouring water from the first to the second container.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 15, which is divisible by 5. Water can be redistributed to make each container have 3 units.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 6, which is divisible by 3, but it's not possible to make each container have 2 units due to the constraints.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 28, which is divisible by 7, but the distribution cannot be balanced due to the presence of a zero.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 28, which is divisible by 7. Water can be redistributed to make each container have 4 units.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Both containers are already balanced with zero units of water.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers already have the same amount of water.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 10, which is divisible by 4, but it's not possible to make each container have 2.5 units.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 10, which is divisible by 10, but it's not possible to balance the water due to the presence of a single container with all the water.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers already have the same amount of water.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 2e9, which is divisible by 2. Each container already has 1e9 units of water.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1000000000 0 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 2e9, which is divisible by 3, but it's not possible to balance the water due to the presence of a zero.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 ... 1 (100000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers already have the same amount of water.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1000000000 0 0 ... 0 (99999 zeros)
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 1e9, which is divisible by 100000, but it's not possible to balance the water due to the presence of 99999 zeros.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases with very large numbers and multiple test cases.
