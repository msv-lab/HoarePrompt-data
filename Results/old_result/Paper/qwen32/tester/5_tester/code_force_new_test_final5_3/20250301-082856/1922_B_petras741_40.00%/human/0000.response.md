Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the problem, including both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The lengths of the sticks are 2, 4, and 8. It's impossible to form a triangle with these lengths because the sum of the two shorter sides (2 + 4) is not greater than the longest side (8).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: All sticks have the same length (2). Any combination of three sticks can form an equilateral triangle.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The lengths of the sticks are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. Only combinations where the sum of the two shorter sides is greater than the longest side can form a triangle. Valid combinations are (1, 2, 4), (1, 4, 8), and (2, 4, 8).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6
0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
20
```
**Explanation**: All sticks have the same length (1). Any combination of three sticks can form an equilateral triangle.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: All sticks have the same length (4). Any combination of three sticks can form an equilateral triangle.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The lengths of the sticks are 2, 2, and 4. The combination (2, 2, 4) can form a degenerate triangle, but since the area must be strictly greater than 0, only (2, 2, 2) is valid.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The lengths of the sticks are 2, 4, and 8. It's impossible to form a triangle because the sum of the two shorter sides (2 + 4) is not greater than the longest side (8).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The lengths of the sticks are 2, 4, 8, and 16. Valid combinations are (2, 4, 8) and (4, 8, 16).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The lengths of the sticks are 2, 2, 2, 4, and 4. Valid combinations include any three sticks of length 2 and combinations of two sticks of length 2 and one stick of length 4.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
120
```
**Explanation**: All sticks have the same length (1). Any combination of three sticks can form an equilateral triangle.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The lengths of the sticks are 1, 2, and 4. The only valid combination is (1, 2, 4).

# Test 12

```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are not enough sticks to form a triangle.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The lengths of the sticks are 2, 2, and 8. It's impossible to form a triangle because the sum of the two shorter sides (2 + 2) is not greater than the longest side (8).
