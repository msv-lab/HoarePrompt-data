Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases that cover both basic and edge scenarios for the given problem.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The permutation is already sorted, and the element 3 is at position 3. No swaps are needed.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 5
3 1 6 5 2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1
3 4
```
**Explanation**: By swapping elements at positions 3 and 4, the permutation becomes [3, 1, 5, 6, 2, 4], and the binary search will correctly find 5.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1
3 5 4 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2 4
1 5
```
**Explanation**: By swapping elements at positions 2 and 4, then 1 and 5, the permutation becomes [1, 2, 4, 5, 3], and the binary search will correctly find 1.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
**Output**: 
```
2
4 5
1 5
```
**Explanation**: By swapping elements at positions 4 and 5, then 1 and 5, the permutation becomes [2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 6], and the binary search will correctly find 3.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
4 5
2 4
```
**Explanation**: By swapping elements at positions 2 and 4, then 1 and 5, the permutation becomes [2, 3, 1], and the binary search will correctly find 2.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The permutation is trivially sorted, and the element 1 is at position 1. No swaps are needed.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: By swapping elements at positions 1 and 2, the permutation becomes [1, 2], and the binary search will correctly find 1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The permutation is already sorted, and the element 2 is at position 2. No swaps are needed.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 2
2 3
```
**Explanation**: By swapping elements at positions 1 and 2, then 2 and 3, the permutation becomes [9, 8, 10, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], and the binary search will correctly find 10.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 2
2 3
```
**Explanation**: By swapping elements at positions 1 and 2, then 2 and 3, the permutation becomes [9, 8, 10, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], and the binary search will correctly find 1 after further swaps.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 50000
100000 99999 ... 50001 50000 49999 ... 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 50000
50000 50001
```
**Explanation**: By swapping elements at positions 1 and 50000, then 50000 and 50001, the permutation becomes partially sorted, and the binary search will correctly find 50000.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 100000
100000 99999 ... 1 200000 199999 ... 100001
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 100000
100000 100001
```
**Explanation**: By swapping elements at positions 1 and 100000, then 100000 and 100001, the permutation becomes partially sorted, and the binary search will correctly find 100000.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring that the solution is robust, reliable, and scalable.
