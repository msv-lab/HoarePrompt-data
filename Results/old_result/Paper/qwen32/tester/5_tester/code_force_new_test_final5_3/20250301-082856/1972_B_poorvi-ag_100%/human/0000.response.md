Sure, let's create comprehensive test cases for the given problem. We'll start with basic test cases and then move on to edge cases.

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
UDD
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Alice starts with "UDD". She can only remove "U" and flip the adjacent "D"s, resulting in "DDD". Bob then loses as there are no more "U"s left.

#### Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
UUDD
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Alice can remove the first "U" and flip the adjacent "U"s, resulting in "DDDD". Bob then loses as there are no more "U"s left.

#### Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
UUDUD
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: As described in the problem statement, Alice can force Bob to lose by playing optimally.

#### Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
UDDUD
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Alice cannot force a win in this scenario as Bob can play optimally to avoid losing.

#### Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
UU
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes one "U" and flips the other "U" to "D", resulting in "D". Bob then removes the last "U" and wins.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1
U
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes the only "U" and wins as there are no more turns.

#### Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1
D
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Alice cannot make a move as there are no "U"s, so she loses immediately.

#### Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
UD
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes "U" and flips "D" to "U", resulting in "U". Bob then removes "U" and loses.

#### Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
DU
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes "U" and flips "D" to "U", resulting in "U". Bob then removes "U" and loses.

#### Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
UUU
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Alice can always remove one "U" and flip the adjacent "U"s, eventually forcing Bob to lose.

#### Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
3
DDD
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Alice cannot make a move as there are no "U"s, so she loses immediately.

#### Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100
UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Alice can always remove one "U" and flip the adjacent "U"s, eventually forcing Bob to lose.

#### Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
100
DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Alice cannot make a move as there are no "U"s, so she loses immediately.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including basic gameplay, edge cases with minimal coins, and the maximum number of coins allowed.
