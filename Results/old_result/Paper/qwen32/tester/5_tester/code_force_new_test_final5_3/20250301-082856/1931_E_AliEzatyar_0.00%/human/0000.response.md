Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
14 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 2 to 2, then Sasha concatenates 2 and 14 to get 214, which is greater than 100.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 5
9 56 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 9 to 9, 56 to 65, and 1 to 1. Sasha can concatenate any two, but the maximum possible value is 9651, which is less than 100000.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 10
1 2007 800 1580
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 1 to 1, 2007 to 7002, 800 to 8, and 1580 to 851. Sasha can concatenate any two, but the maximum possible value is less than 10000000000.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
5000 123 30 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 5000 to 5, 123 to 321, 30 to 3, and 4 to 4. Sasha can concatenate 321 and 5000 to get 3215000, which is greater than 100000.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
6 4 6 2 3 1 10 9 10 7
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse each number, but the maximum possible value Sasha can concatenate is less than 10000000000.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
6
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna reverses 6 to 6, and Sasha cannot make a move. The final number is 6, which is less than 10.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna reverses 10 to 1, and Sasha cannot make a move. The final number is 1, which is less than 10, but since the number is 10 initially, Sasha wins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
8 9
1 2 9 10 10 2 10 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse each number, but the maximum possible value Sasha can concatenate is less than 1000000000.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna reverses each 10 to 1, and Sasha can concatenate any two, but the maximum possible value is 11, which is less than 100000.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 9
1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna reverses 1 to 1, and Sasha concatenates 1 and 1000000000 to get 10000000001, which is greater than 1000000000.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
5 0
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna reverses each 1 to 1, and Sasha can concatenate any two, but the maximum possible value is 11, which is greater than 1, but since m is 0, Sasha wins.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna reverses each 1 to 1, and Sasha can concatenate any two, but the maximum possible value is 11, which is greater than 10, but since m is 1, Sasha wins.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1
1 1 1 1 10
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
