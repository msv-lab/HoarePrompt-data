Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem. We'll cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

### Basic Test Cases

1. **Test 1**: Minimum values of `n` and `k`.
   - **Input**: 
     ```
     1
     2 2
     ```
   - **Output**: 
     ```
     2 1
     ```

2. **Test 2**: Smallest possible `n` with a larger `k`.
   - **Input**: 
     ```
     1
     4 2
     ```
   - **Output**: 
     ```
     1 4 2 3
     ```

3. **Test 3**: Larger `n` with `k` equal to `n`.
   - **Input**: 
     ```
     1
     4 4
     ```
   - **Output**: 
     ```
     1 2 3 4
     ```

4. **Test 4**: Basic case with `k` being a small even number.
   - **Input**: 
     ```
     1
     6 4
     ```
   - **Output**: 
     ```
     1 6 2 5 3 4
     ```

5. **Test 5**: Basic case with `k` being a large even number.
   - **Input**: 
     ```
     1
     10 6
     ```
   - **Output**: 
     ```
     1 10 2 9 3 8 4 7 5 6
     ```

### Edge Test Cases

6. **Test 6**: `n` and `k` are both at their maximum values.
   - **Input**: 
     ```
     1
     200000 2
     ```
   - **Output**: 
     ```
     1 200000 2 199999 3 199998 ... 100000 100001
     ```
     (Note: The pattern here is alternating between the smallest and largest remaining numbers.)

7. **Test 7**: `n` is at its maximum, and `k` is a small even number.
   - **Input**: 
     ```
     1
     200000 4
     ```
   - **Output**: 
     ```
     1 200000 2 199999 3 199998 4 199997 ... 100000 100001
     ```

8. **Test 8**: `n` is at its maximum, and `k` is close to `n`.
   - **Input**: 
     ```
     1
     200000 199998
     ```
   - **Output**: 
     ```
     1 200000 2 199999 3 199998 ... 99999 100001 100000
     ```

9. **Test 9**: Multiple test cases with varying `n` and `k`.
   - **Input**: 
     ```
     3
     5 2
     7 4
     10 6
     ```
   - **Output**: 
     ```
     1 5 2 4 3
     1 6 2 5 3 4 7
     1 10 2 9 3 8 4 7 5 6
     ```

10. **Test 10**: Test with multiple test cases where `k` is the same but `n` varies.
    - **Input**: 
      ```
      3
      4 2
      6 2
      8 2
      ```
    - **Output**: 
      ```
      1 4 2 3
      1 6 2 5 3 4
      1 8 2 7 3 6 4 5
      ```

11. **Test 11**: Test with multiple test cases where `n` is the same but `k` varies.
    - **Input**: 
      ```
      3
      6 2
      6 4
      6 6
      ```
    - **Output**: 
      ```
      1 6 2 5 3 4
      1 6 2 5 3 4
      1 2 3 4 5 6
      ```

12. **Test 12**: Test with a large number of test cases.
    - **Input**: 
      ```
      10000
      2 2
      4 2
      6 2
      ...
      200000 2
      ```
    - **Output**: 
      ```
      2 1
      1 4 2 3
      1 6 2 5 3 4
      ...
      1 200000 2 199999 3 199998 ... 100000 100001
      ```

These test cases should cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring that the solution is robust and handles both typical and edge cases effectively.
