```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The number 10 can be split into 1 and 0, resulting in [9, 1, 0], which can be sorted to [0, 1, 9].

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
10 9
```
**Output**: 
```

```
**Explanation**: The array is already sorted and consists of nines.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```

```
**Explanation**: The array is in descending order and cannot be sorted.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
5
10 10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Each number can be split into 1 and 0, resulting in [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], which can be sorted to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
5
12 21 13 31 23
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: No matter how the numbers are split, the array cannot be sorted.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
5
12 10 11 9 13
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The number 10 can be split into 1 and 0, resulting in [12, 1, 0, 11, 9, 13], which can be sorted to [0, 1, 9, 11, 12, 13].

# Test 17

**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 10 100 1000 10000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The numbers 100, 1000, and 10000 are out of the problem's constraints (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99), but if they were valid, they couldn't be split into valid digits within the constraints.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
