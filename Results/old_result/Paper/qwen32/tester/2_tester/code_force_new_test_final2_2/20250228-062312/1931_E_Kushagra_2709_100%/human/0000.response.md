Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem. We'll cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
14 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 2 to 2, and Sasha can concatenate 14 and 2 to get 142, which is greater than 10^2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 5
9 56 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 9 to 9, 56 to 65, and 1 to 1. Sasha can concatenate any two, but the maximum possible number is 651, which is less than 10^5.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 10
1 2007 800 1580
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse any number, but Sasha can only concatenate, and the maximum possible number is less than 10^10.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
5000 123 30 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse numbers, and Sasha can concatenate to form 5000123304, which is greater than 10^5.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
6 4 6 2 3 1 10 9 10 7
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse numbers, and Sasha can concatenate to form a number greater than 10^10.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
6
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 6 to 6, and Sasha can't make a move since there's only one number left.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 10 to 1, and Sasha can't make a move, but since the number is 10, Sasha wins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
8 9
1 2 9 10 10 2 10 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse numbers, and Sasha can concatenate, but the maximum possible number is less than 10^9.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse numbers, and Sasha can concatenate, but the maximum possible number is less than 10^5.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 0
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 1 to 1, and Sasha can concatenate to form 11, which is greater than 10^0.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2 9
1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 1 to 1, and Sasha can concatenate to form 10000000001, but since the number is 10000000001, Sasha wins, but the problem states Sasha can't make a move, so Anna wins.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2 10
1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 1 to 1, and Sasha can concatenate to form 10000000001, but since the number is 10000000001, Sasha wins, but the problem states Sasha can't make a move, so Anna wins.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10 6
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse numbers, and Sasha can concatenate to form a number greater than 10^6.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10 7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse numbers, and Sasha can concatenate, but the maximum possible number is less than 10^7.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 1 to 1, and Sasha can concatenate to form 110 or 101, which is greater than 10^1.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality and edge cases, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
