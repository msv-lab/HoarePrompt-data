Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
ab
```
**Explanation**: There are two possible strings of length 1: "a" and "b". Both are present in "ab".

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
aa
```
**Explanation**: There is only one possible string of length 2: "aa". It is present in "aa".

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
baab
```
**Explanation**: There are four possible strings of length 2: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb". All are present in "baab".

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
abcbac
```
**Explanation**: There are nine possible strings of length 2: "aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc". All are present in "abcbac".

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
baaabbaabb
```
**Explanation**: There are eight possible strings of length 3: "aaa", "aab", "aba", "abb", "baa", "bab", "bba", "bbb". All are present in "baaabbaabb".

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
abcabcabc
```
**Explanation**: There are 27 possible strings of length 3 using 'a', 'b', 'c'. All are present in "abcabcabc".

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 26
```
**Output**: 
```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Explanation**: There are 26 possible strings of length 1, each corresponding to a single character from 'a' to 'z'. All are present in the string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 26
```
**Output**: 
```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Explanation**: There are 676 possible strings of length 2. A simple way to ensure all are present is to repeat the alphabet twice, ensuring all combinations are covered.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
26 26
```
**Output**: 
```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz... (repeated many times)
```
**Explanation**: This is the maximum possible input. The output string needs to include all possible 26^26 combinations of length 26 using 'a' to 'z'. This is a theoretical test case as the output string would be extremely large.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
676
1 1
1 2
1 3
...
1 26
2 1
2 2
2 3
...
2 26
...
26 1
26 2
...
26 26
```
**Output**: 
```
a
ab
abc
...
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
a
aa
aaa
...
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
...
a
aa
aaa
...
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
...
a
aa
aaa
...
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Explanation**: This tests all possible combinations of n and k from 1 to 26. Each test case should produce a valid string that contains all possible subsequences of length n using the first k letters of the alphabet.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
abcdabcd
```
**Explanation**: There are 16 possible strings of length 2 using 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'. Repeating the string "abcd" twice ensures all combinations are present.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
abcdabcdbacdbadbcadbdabcdbacdbadbcadbd
```
**Explanation**: There are 64 possible strings of length 3 using 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'. The output string includes all combinations.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust, reliable, and scalable.
