Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
! 1
```
**Explanation**: The array is `[1]`. The only subarray is `[1]`, and `f(1, 1) = 1 * 1 = 1`. Since `k = 1`, the answer is `1`.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
? 1 1
? 2 1
! -1
```
**Explanation**: The array could be `[1, 2]` or `[2, 1]`. For both cases, there is no way to split the array into two subarrays such that both have `f(l, r) = 1`. Hence, the answer is `-1`.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
? 1 1
? 2 1
? 3 1
! -1
```
**Explanation**: The array could be `[1, 2, 3]` or any permutation. There is no way to split the array into three subarrays such that all have `f(l, r) = 1`. Hence, the answer is `-1`.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
```
**Output**: 
```
? 1 4
? 3 4
! 4
```
**Explanation**: The array could be `[1, 2, 3, 4]` or any permutation where the maximum value is `4`. We can split the array into two subarrays `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4]`, both having `f(l, r) = 4`. Hence, the answer is `4`.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
? 1 10000
! 10000
```
**Explanation**: The array could be `[10000, 1, 1, ..., 1]` (with 9999 ones). The only subarray is the entire array, and `f(1, 10000) = 10000 * 10000 = 10000`. Since `k = 1`, the answer is `10000`.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10000 10000
```
**Output**: 
```
? 1 1
? 2 1
...
? 10000 1
! 1
```
**Explanation**: The array could be `[1, 1, ..., 1]` (all ones). We can split the array into 10000 subarrays each of size 1, and `f(l, r) = 1 * 1 = 1` for all. Hence, the answer is `1`.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10 5
```
**Output**: 
```
? 1 10
? 3 10
? 6 10
? 8 10
! 10
```
**Explanation**: The array could be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`. We can split the array into five subarrays `[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8], [9, 10]`, each having `f(l, r) = 10`. Hence, the answer is `10`.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 3
```
**Output**: 
```
? 1 30
? 4 30
? 7 30
! 30
```
**Explanation**: The array could be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`. We can split the array into three subarrays `[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9, 10]`, each having `f(l, r) = 30`. Hence, the answer is `30`.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 3
```
**Output**: 
```
? 1 30
? 4 30
? 7 30
! -1
```
**Explanation**: The array could be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1]`. We cannot split the array into three subarrays each having `f(l, r) = 30`. Hence, the answer is `-1`.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 3
```
**Output**: 
```
? 1 30
? 4 30
? 7 30
? 1 20
? 4 20
? 7 20
! 20
```
**Explanation**: The array could be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1]`. We can split the array into three subarrays `[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 1]`, each having `f(l, r) = 20`. Hence, the answer is `20`.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases, and large inputs, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the solution.
