Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem. We'll start with basic scenarios and then move on to edge cases.

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1: No Friends
**Input**: 
```
1
100 0 24
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are no pairs of friends, so the friendship value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds.

#### Test 2: One Pair of Friends
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 10
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
**Explanation**: There is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its friendship value is initially 1, so each turn they are picked and their friendship value increases by 1. Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+...+10 = 55.

#### Test 3: Multiple Pairs of Friends
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2 4
1 2 25
3 2 24
```
**Output**: 
```
40000020
```
**Explanation**: There are two pairs of friends. The expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions is calculated as per the problem statement.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4: Maximum Number of Children and No Friends
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The maximum number of children with no friendships means the friendship value for all pairs is 0.

9 10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
45
```
**Explanation**: All possible pairs are friends with a friendship value of 1. Since only one excursion is made, the total sum is the number of friends.

#### Test 6: Maximum Number of Excursions
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 200000
1 2 1
1 3 1
2 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
400000000
```
**Explanation**: There are three pairs of friends, and each excursion can choose any of these pairs. The expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions is calculated as per the problem statement.

#### Test 7: Large Friendship Values
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 1
1 2 1000000000
1 3 1000000000
2 3 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
3000000000
```
**Explanation**: Each pair has a very large friendship value, and only one excursion is made. The total sum is the sum of the friendship values of all pairs.

#### Test 8: Multiple Test Cases
**Input**: 
```
3
2 1 10
1 2 1
3 3 1
1 2 1
1 3 1
2 3 1
100 0 24
```
**Output**: 
```
55
3
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case includes multiple scenarios: one pair of friends, multiple pairs of friends, and no friends.

### Additional Edge Cases

#### Test 9: Single Pair of Friends with Large Number of Excursions

```
1
2 1 100000
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5000050000
```
**Explanation**: The friendship value increases significantly with a large number of excursions.

#### Test 10: All Possible Pairs are Friends with Same Friendship Value
**Input**: 
```
1
4 6 1
1 2 1
1 3 1
1 4 1
2 3 1
2 4 1
3 4 1
```
