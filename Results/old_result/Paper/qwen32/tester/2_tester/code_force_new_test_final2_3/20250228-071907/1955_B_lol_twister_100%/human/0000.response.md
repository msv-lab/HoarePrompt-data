# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 2

```
YES
```
**Comment**: Basic test case with the smallest possible n (n=2) and simple values for c and d.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Comment**: Basic test case with the smallest possible n (n=2) and simple values for c and d, but with the elements in reverse order.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Comment**: Basic test case with the smallest possible n (n=2) and simple values for c and d, but with incorrect elements.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
500 1 1
{1, 2, ..., 250000} (all numbers from 1 to 250000 in random order)
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Comment**: Edge case with the largest possible n (n=500) and simple values for c and d, using all numbers from 1 to 250000 in random order.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
500 1 1
{2, 3, ..., 250001} (all numbers from 2 to 250001 in random order)
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Comment**: Edge case with the largest possible n (n=500) and simple values for c and d, but with incorrect elements starting from 2 to 250001.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1000000 1000000
1000000000 2000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Comment**: Edge case with the smallest possible n (n=2) and very large values for c and d, using the maximum possible element values.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1000000 1000000
1000000000 2000000001
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Comment**: Edge case with the smallest possible n (n=2) and very large values for c and d, but with an incorrect element value.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
10000
2 1 1
{1, 2, ..., 4} (repeated 2500 times for each test case)
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
YES
...
YES (10000 times)
```
**Comment**: Stress test with the maximum number of test cases (t=10000), each having the smallest possible n (n=2) and simple values for c and d, using the same set of elements {1, 2, 3, 4}.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
10000
2 1 1
{1, 2, 3, 5} (repeated 2500 times for each test case)
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
NO
...
NO (10000 times)
```
**Comment**: Stress test with the maximum number of test cases (t=10000), each having the smallest possible n (n=2) and simple values for c and d, but with incorrect elements {1, 2, 3, 5}.
