Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the problem described, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Bob wins when no numbers are removed since XOR(1, 2, 3) = 0.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Bob wins if Eve removes one 1 and one 3, leaving XOR(2, 4, 4) = 0.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Bob wins in each round as Eve can always remove pairs of numbers that result in XOR = 0.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Bob wins in each round as Eve can always remove pairs of numbers that result in XOR = 0.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
0 9 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
12
```
**Explanation**: Bob wins in each round as Eve can always remove pairs of numbers that result in XOR = 0.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: No numbers to play with, so no games are played.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: XOR(1, 1, 1, 1) = 0, so Bob wins initially.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
0 4 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: XOR(2, 2, 2, 2) = 0, so Bob wins initially.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 4 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: XOR(3, 3, 3, 3) = 0, so Bob wins initially.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 0 4
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: XOR(4, 4, 4, 4) = 0, so Bob wins initially.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: XOR(1, 2, 3, 4) = 4, so Alice wins initially, but Bob wins when one number is removed.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Bob wins in each round as Eve can always remove pairs of numbers that result in XOR = 0.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
200 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
199
```
**Explanation**: XOR of 200 ones is 0, so Bob wins 199 times as Eve removes one 1 each time.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
0 200 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
99
```
**Explanation**: XOR of 200 twos is 0, so Bob wins 99 times as Eve removes two 2s each time.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 200 0
```
**Output**: 
```
99
```
**Explanation**: XOR of 200 threes is 0, so Bob wins 99 times as Eve removes two 3s each time.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 0 200
```
**Output**: 
```
99
```
**Explanation**: XOR of 200 fours is 0, so Bob wins 99 times as Eve removes two 4s each time.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
100 100 100 100
```
**Output**: 
```
299
```
**Explanation**: Bob wins in each round as Eve can always remove pairs of numbers that result in XOR = 0.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Bob wins in each round as Eve can always remove pairs of numbers that result in XOR = 0.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: Bob wins in each round as Eve can always remove pairs of numbers that result in XOR = 0.

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
14
```
**Explanation**: Bob wins in each round as Eve can always remove pairs of numbers that result in XOR = 0.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust, reliable, and scalable.
