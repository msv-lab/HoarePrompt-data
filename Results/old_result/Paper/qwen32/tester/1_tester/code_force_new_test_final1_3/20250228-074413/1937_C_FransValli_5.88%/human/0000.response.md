### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Input**: 
```
2
4
? 0 2 3 1
<
? 1 1 2 3
=
? 1 2 0 3
>
```
**Output**: 
```
! 3 2
! 0 1
```
**Explanation**: This is the example provided in the problem statement. The permutation is [0, 3, 1, 2]. The queries and responses match the example, and the expected output is provided.

#### Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
? 0 1 1 0
=
```
**Output**: 
```
! 0 1
```
**Explanation**: The simplest case with n=2. The permutation can be [0, 1] or [1, 0]. The bitwise OR of both pairs is the same, and the XOR is 1, which is the maximum possible value.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
? 0 1 1 2
<
? 0 2 1 2
>
? 0 1 2 0
>
```
**Output**: 
```
! 2 0
```
**Explanation**: The permutation is [0, 1, 2]. The queries and responses are designed to identify the maximum XOR pair, which is (2, 0) with XOR value 2.

#### Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
10
? 0 1 2 3
<
? 4 5 6 7
<
? 8 9 0 1
>
? 2 3 4 5
>
? 6 7 8 9
>
? 0 1 8 9
>
```
**Output**: 
```
! 8 9
```
**Explanation**: A larger permutation with n=10. The queries and responses are designed to identify the maximum XOR pair, which is (8, 9) with XOR value 15.

#### Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10000
? 0 1 2 3
<
? 4 5 6 7
<
...
? 9996 9997 9998 9999
>
```
**Output**: 
```
! 9998 9999
```
**Explanation**: The largest possible value for n, which is 10000. The queries and responses are designed to identify the maximum XOR pair, which is (9998, 9999) with XOR value 32767.

#### Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
? 0 1 0 1
=
```
**Output**: 
```
! 0 1
```
**Explanation**: The permutation is [0, 1] or [1, 0]. The bitwise OR of both pairs is the same, and the XOR is 1, which is the maximum possible value. This test checks the case where the OR values are equal.

#### Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
? 0 1 1 2
<
? 0 2 1 2
>
? 0 1 2 0
>
? 1 2 0 1
<
```
**Output**: 
```
! 2 0
```
**Explanation**: The permutation is [0, 1, 2]. The queries and responses are designed to identify the maximum XOR pair, which is (2, 0) with XOR value 2. This test checks the case where the OR values are not equal and the XOR is maximized.

#### Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
? 0 1 2 3
<
? 1 1 2 3
=
? 1 2 0 3
>
? 0 3 1 2
=
```
**Output**: 
```
! 3 2
```
**Explanation**: The permutation is [0, 3, 1, 2]. The queries and responses are designed to identify the maximum XOR pair, which is (3, 2) with XOR value 3. This test checks the case where the OR values are equal and the XOR is maximized.

#### Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5
? 0 1 2 3
<
? 4 0 1 2
>
? 3 4 0 1
>
? 2 3 4 0
>
? 1 2 3 4
>
```
**Output**: 
```
! 4 0
```
**Explanation**: The permutation is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. The queries and responses are designed to identify the maximum XOR pair, which is (4, 0) with XOR value 5. This test checks the case where the OR values are not equal and the XOR is maximized.

#### Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
? 0 1 2 3
<
? 4 5 6 7
<
? 8 9 0 1
>
? 2 3 4 5
>
? 6 7 8 9
>
? 0 1 8 9
>
? 2 3 6 7
<
? 4 5 8 9
>
? 0 1 4 5
<
? 2 3 0 1
<
? 6 7 4 5
<
? 8 9 2 3
<
```
**Output**: 
```
! 8 9
```
**Explanation**: A larger permutation with n=10. The queries and responses are designed to identify the maximum XOR pair, which is (8, 9) with XOR value 15. This test checks a more complex scenario with multiple queries.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases, and large inputs, ensuring the solution is robust and scalable.
