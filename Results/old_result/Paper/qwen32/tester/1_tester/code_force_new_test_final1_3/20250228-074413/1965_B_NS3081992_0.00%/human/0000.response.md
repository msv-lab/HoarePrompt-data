Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
*Explanation*: We need a subsequence that adds up to 1, but not one that adds up to 2. The sequence [1] satisfies this.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
2 3 4 5 6
```
*Explanation*: All elements are greater than k=1, so no subsequence adds up to 1. Every other integer between 1 and 6 can be formed by subsequences of [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
8 8
```
**Output**: 
```
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
*Explanation*: All elements are 1, so no subsequence adds up to 8. Every other integer between 1 and 7 can be formed by subsequences of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
9 3
```
**Output**: 
```
4
7 1 4 1
```
*Explanation*: No subsequence adds up to 3. Every other integer between 1 and 9 can be formed by subsequences of [7, 1, 4, 1].

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10 7
```
**Output**: 
```
4
1 2 8 3
```
*Explanation*: No subsequence adds up to 7. Every other integer between 1 and 10 can be formed by subsequences of [1, 2, 8, 3].

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
2
```
*Explanation*: We need a subsequence that adds up to 2, but not one that adds up to 1. The sequence [2] satisfies this.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
2 3 4 5 6
```
*Explanation*: All elements are greater than k=1, so no subsequence adds up to 1. Every other integer between 1 and 1000000 can be formed by subsequences of [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] (though the actual sequence can be larger).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
9
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
*Explanation*: All elements are 1, so no subsequence adds up to 1000000. Every other integer between 1 and 999999 can be formed by subsequences of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (though the actual sequence can be larger).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 2
```
**Output**: 
```
9
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
```
*Explanation*: All elements are greater than k=2, so no subsequence adds up to 2. Every other integer between 1 and 1000000 can be formed by subsequences of [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] (though the actual sequence can be larger).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 500000
```
**Output**: 
```
10
1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 1000000
```
*Explanation*: No subsequence adds up to 500000. Every other integer between 1 and 1000000 can be formed by subsequences of [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 1000000].

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 999999
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
*Explanation*: We need a subsequence that adds up to 1, but not one that adds up to 999999. The sequence [1] satisfies this.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
9
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
*Explanation*: All elements are 1, so no subsequence adds up to 1000000. Every other integer between 1 and 999999 can be formed by subsequences of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
10
1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512
```
*Explanation*: No subsequence adds up to 1000000. Every other integer between 1 and 1000000 can be formed by subsequences of [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512].

### Multiple Test Cases
