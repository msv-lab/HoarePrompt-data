# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: In a 10x10 grid, to cover 4 diagonals, we can color two cells diagonally opposite each other.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 19

**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: In a very large grid, to cover just 2 diagonals, we can color two cells diagonally opposite each other.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 399999998
```
**Output**: 
```
199999999
```
**Explanation**: In a very large grid, to cover almost all diagonals, we need to color cells in such a way that almost all diagonals are covered with a minimum of 199999999 cells.
