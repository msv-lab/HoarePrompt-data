Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios:

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Explanation**: A 1x1 rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1

**Input**: 
```
1
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes

**Input**: 
```
1
6 3
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Explanation**: A 6x3 rectangle can be cut into two 6x1.5 rectangles, but since sides must be integers, it can only be cut into two 3x3 rectangles, which can only form a 3x6 rectangle (same as 6x3).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: A 10^9 x 10^9 rectangle can be cut into two 10^9 x 5x10^8 rectangles, which can form a 5x10^8 x 2x10^9 rectangle.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Explanation**: A 1x10^9 rectangle can only be cut into two 1x5x10^8 rectangles, which can only form a 5x10^8 x 2 rectangles (same as 1x10^9).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 2
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Explanation**: A 10^9 x 2 rectangle can only be cut into two 10^9 x 1 rectangles, which can only form a 1x2x10^9 rectangle (same as 2x10^9).

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Explanation**: A 2x10^9 rectangle can only be cut into two 1x10^9 rectangles, which can only form a 10^9 x 2 rectangle (same as 2x10^9).

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: A 3x3 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1.5 rectangles, but since sides must be integers, it can only be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, which can form a 1x6 rectangle.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: A 4x2 rectangle can be cut into two 4x1 rectangles, which can form a 1x8 rectangle.
