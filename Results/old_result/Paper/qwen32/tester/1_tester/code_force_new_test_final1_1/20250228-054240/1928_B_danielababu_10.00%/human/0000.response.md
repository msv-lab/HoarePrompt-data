Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: By choosing permutation [2, 1], the array becomes [3, 3], where 3 occurs twice.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
7 1 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: By choosing permutation [2, 3, 1, 4], the array becomes [9, 4, 5, 5], where 5 occurs twice.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
103 102 104
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: By choosing permutation [1, 3, 2], the array becomes [104, 105, 106], where all elements are distinct, but choosing permutation [3, 1, 2] results in [106, 103, 106], where 106 occurs twice. However, choosing permutation [2, 3, 1] results in [105, 104, 105], where 105 occurs twice. Choosing permutation [1, 2, 3] results in [104, 103, 107], where all elements are distinct. The best choice is permutation [1, 2, 3] which results in [104, 103, 107] and then adjusting to [104, 104, 104] by choosing permutation [3, 2, 1].

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 101 1 100 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: By choosing permutation [2, 5, 3, 4, 1], the array becomes [3, 106, 4, 104, 2], where no number occurs more than twice.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 10 100 1000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: By choosing permutation [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the array becomes [2, 12, 103, 1004, 6], where all elements are distinct.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: By choosing permutation [2, 1], the array becomes [5, 2], where all elements are distinct.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1000000000 999999997 999999999
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: By choosing permutation [2, 3, 1], the array becomes [1000000002, 999999999, 1000000000], where 999999999 occurs twice.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: By choosing permutation [1], the array remains [2], where 2 occurs once.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: By choosing permutation [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], the array becomes [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], where all elements are distinct. However, choosing permutation [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1] results in [11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2], where all elements are distinct. The best choice is permutation [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] which results in [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], where 2 occurs 10 times.
