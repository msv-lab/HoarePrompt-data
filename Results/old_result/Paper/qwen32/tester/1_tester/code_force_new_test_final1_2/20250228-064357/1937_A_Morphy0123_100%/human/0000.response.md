**Input**: 
```
1
4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**:

After performing swap(4), the array becomes [3, 4, 2, 1, 5]. After performing swap(5), the array becomes [3, 4, 2, 5, 1]. The position of 1 is 4.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
6
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: 
- Initially, the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. After performing swap(2), the array becomes [2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]. After performing swap(3), the array becomes [3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6]. After performing swap(4), the array becomes [3, 4, 2, 1, 5, 6]. After performing swap(5), the array becomes [3, 4, 2, 5, 1, 6]. After performing swap(6), the array becomes [3, 4, 6, 5, 1, 2]. The position of 1 is 3.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
**Explanation**: 
- Initially, the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. After performing all swaps, the position of 1 is 8.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
120240229
```
**Output**: 
```
67108864
```
**Explanation**: 
- Large input case as given in the problem statement. The position of 1 after all swaps is 67108864.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
2
```
**Explanation**: 
- Multiple test cases in a single input. First test case has n=1, second test case has n=2.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
3
100000000
100000001
100000002
```
**Output**: 
```
6291456
6291456
6291456
```
**Explanation**: 
- Large values of n for multiple test cases. The position of 1 stabilizes to 6291456 for these inputs.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
536870912
```
**Explanation**: 
- Maximum value of n as per the problem constraints. The position of 1 after all swaps is 536870912.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
1073741824
```
**Explanation**:
