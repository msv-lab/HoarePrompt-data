**Input**: 
```
5
0 2 1
0 0 1
4 -3 4
11 0 3
11 5 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The disks can be adjusted such that they remain tangent and the sum of radii decreases.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
4
2 2 2
7 2 3
7 7 2
2 7 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The disks are arranged in a way that no adjustment can make the sum of radii decrease while maintaining tangency.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2
0 0 1
0 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The disks are tangent and can be adjusted to decrease the sum of radii.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
3

**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Two disks are tangent at the origin and can be adjusted to decrease the sum of radii.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
3
-1000000000 0 1
1000000000 0 1
0 0 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The disks are arranged such that the central disk is too large compared to the outer disks, making it impossible to decrease the sum of radii.
