Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem.

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 3 1 5
3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- Stepan needs to send 1 message at moment 3. Starting with 3 units of charge, and losing 1 unit per second, he will have 0 units of charge at moment 3, making it impossible to send the message.

#### Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 4 1 5
3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- Stepan needs to send 1 message at moment 3. Starting with 4 units of charge, and losing 1 unit per second, he will have 1 unit of charge at moment 3, which is enough to send the message.

#### Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 5 1 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- Stepan needs to send 2 messages at moments 1 and 3. Starting with 5 units of charge, he can send the first message at moment 1 (4 units left), turn off and on (2 units lost), and send the second message at moment 3 (2 units left).

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- Stepan needs to send 1 message at moment 1000000000. Starting with 1000000000 units of charge, and losing 1000000000 units per second, he will have 0 units of charge at moment 1, making it impossible to send the message.

#### Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000 1 1000000000
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- Stepan needs to send 1 message at moment 1000000000. Starting with 1000000000 units of charge, and losing 1 unit per second, he will have 999999000 units of charge at moment 1000000000, which is more than enough to send the message.

#### Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3 11 9 6
6 8 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- Stepan needs to send 3 messages at moments 6, 8, and 10. Starting with 11 units of charge, he can turn off and on at moment 0, then send messages at moments 6, 8, and 10, maintaining sufficient charge.

#### Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
12 621526648 2585904 3566299
51789 61859 71998 73401 247675 298086 606959 663464 735972 806043 806459 919683
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- Stepan needs to send 12 messages at various moments. Starting with 621526648 units of charge, he can carefully manage the phone's charge by turning it off and on at strategic moments to ensure sufficient charge for all messages.

#### Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 10 1 10
1 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- Stepan needs to send 2 messages at moments 1 and 10. Starting with 10 units of charge, he can send the first message at moment 1 (9 units left), but turning off and on at moment 1 will leave him with -1 units, making it impossible to send the second message.

#### Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2 11 1 10
1 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- Stepan needs to send 2 messages at moments 1 and 10. Starting with 11 units of charge, he can send the first message at moment 1 (10 units left), turn off and on at moment 1 (1 unit left), and send the second message at moment 10 (1 unit left).

#### Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- Stepan needs to send 1 message at moment 1. Starting with 1 unit of charge, and losing 1 unit per second, he will have 0 units of charge at moment 1, making it impossible to send the message.

#### Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2 1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- Stepan needs to send 1 message at moment 1. Starting with 2 units of charge, and losing 1 unit per second, he will have 1 unit of charge at moment 1, which is enough to send the message.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the robustness, reliability, and scalability of the solution.
