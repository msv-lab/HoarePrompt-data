4
0 0 2147483647 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The two `0`s must be in one group and the two `2147483647`s must be in another group.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The two `0`s must be in one group and the `2147483647` must be in another group.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
8
1858058912 289424735 1858058912 2024818580 1858058912 289424735 122665067 289424735
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The numbers have multiple duplicates and different bit patterns, requiring four groups.

# Test 10 (Edge Case: All zeros)
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: All numbers are the same, so they can be in the same group.

# Test 11 (Edge Case: All ones)
**Input**: 
```
1
5
2147483647 2147483647 2147483647 2147483647 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: All numbers are the same, so they can be in the same group.

# Test 12 (Edge Case: All different numbers)
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 4 8 16
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: All numbers have no bits in common, so they can be in the same group.
