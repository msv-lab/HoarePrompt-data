Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem. We will cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5
3 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, emptying all piles.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 7
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Alice must choose k=1, leaving piles as [0, 6]. Bob then chooses k=6, winning the game.

Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can make a move that leaves Bob in a losing position.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose k=1, leaving piles as [0, 1, 2]. Bob then chooses k=1, leaving [0, 0, 1]. Alice wins by choosing k=1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
6
2 1 3 4 2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Alice makes a move, but Bob can always counter Alice's moves optimally to win.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
8
5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can make a move that leaves Bob in a losing position.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose k=1000000000, winning the game in one move.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose k=1, emptying the pile and winning immediately.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Alice must choose k=1, leaving piles as [0, 0]. Bob cannot make a move and loses.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose k=1, emptying all piles and winning immediately.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 ... 1 (100000 ones)
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Alice must choose k=1, leaving all piles as 0 after 100000 moves. Bob cannot make a move and loses.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 3 ... 100000 (increasing sequence)
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can make a move that leaves Bob in a losing position.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
100000 99999 99998 ... 1 (decreasing sequence)
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can make a move that leaves Bob in a losing position.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose k=1000000000, emptying both piles and winning immediately.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
10000
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
Alice
...
Alice (10000 times)
```
**Explanation**: Each test case consists of a single pile with 1 stone. Alice wins each game.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring that the solution is robust and handles both typical and edge cases effectively.
