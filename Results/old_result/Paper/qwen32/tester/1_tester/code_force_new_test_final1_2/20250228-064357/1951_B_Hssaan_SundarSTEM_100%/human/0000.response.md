Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem. We'll cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

### Basic Test Cases

**Test 1: Simple Case with No Swap Needed**
- **Input**: 
```
1
3 1
10 5 1
```
- **Output**: 
```
2
```
- **Explanation**: Cow 1 (rating 10) wins against cow 2 (rating 5) and then against cow 3 (rating 1).

**Test 2: Simple Case with Swap Needed**
- **Input**: 
```
1
3 2
1 10 5
```
- **Output**: 
```
2
```
- **Explanation**: Swap cow 2 with cow 1. Now cow 2 (rating 10) wins against cow 1 (rating 1) and then against cow 3 (rating 5).

**Test 3: Cow Already in Strong Position**
- **Input**: 
```
1
4 3
1 2 100 3
```
- **Output**: 
```
3
```
- **Explanation**: Cow 3 (rating 100) wins all matches since it is the strongest.

**Test 4: Cow in Weak Position**
- **Input**: 
```
1
4 1
1 100 2 3
```
- **Output**: 
```
0
```
- **Explanation**: Cow 1 (rating 1) loses the first match.

**Test 5: Multiple Test Cases**
- **Input**: 
```
3
2 1
10 5
2 2
5 10
3 3
1 2 3
```
- **Output**: 
```
1
0
2
```
- **Explanation**: 
  - Test case 1: Cow 1 wins against cow 2.
  - Test case 2: Cow 2 is already in position 2 and loses the first match.
  - Test case 3: Cow 3 wins all matches.

### Edge Test Cases

**Test 6: Maximum Number of Cows**
- **Input**: 
```
1
100000 1
1 2 3 ... 100000
```
- **Output**: 
```
99999
```
- **Explanation**: Cow 1 wins all matches since it is the strongest.

**Test 7: Minimum Number of Cows**
- **Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 2
```
- **Output**: 
```
0
```
- **Explanation**: Cow 1 loses the first match.

**Test 8: Cow in Last Position**
- **Input**: 
```
1
4 4
1 2 3 100
```
- **Output**: 
```
3
```
- **Explanation**: Cow 4 (rating 100) wins all matches since it is the strongest and in the last position.

**Test 9: Cow in Second Last Position**
- **Input**: 
```
1
4 3
1 2 100 3
```
- **Output**: 
```
3
```
- **Explanation**: Cow 3 (rating 100) wins all matches since it is the strongest and in the second last position.

**Test 10: Swap to First Position**
- **Input**: 
```
1
4 2
100 1 2 3
```
- **Output**: 
```
3
```
- **Explanation**: Swap cow 2 with cow 1. Now cow 2 (rating 100) wins all matches since it is the strongest and in the first position.

**Test 11: Swap to Second Position**
- **Input**: 
```
1
4 3
1 100 2 3
```
- **Output**: 
```
3
```
- **Explanation**: Swap cow 3 with cow 2. Now cow 3 (rating 100) wins all matches since it is the strongest and in the second position.

**Test 12: Swap to Third Position**
- **Input**: 
```
1
5 4
1 2 100 3 4
```
- **Output**: 
```
3
```
- **Explanation**: Swap cow 4 with cow 3. Now cow 4 (rating 100) wins all matches since it is the strongest and in the third position.

**Test 13: All Ratings in Descending Order**
- **Input**: 
```
1
5 3
100 90 80 70 60
```
- **Output**: 
```
2
```
- **Explanation**: Cow 3 (rating 80) wins against cow 4 (rating 70) and cow 5 (rating 60).

**Test 14: All Ratings in Ascending Order**
- **Input**: 
```
1
5 3
10 20 30 40 50
```
- **Output**: 
```
0
```
- **Explanation**: Cow 3 (rating 30) loses the first match.

**Test 15: Large Ratings with Optimal Swap**
- **Input**: 
```
1
5 2
1000000000 1 100000000 10000000 1000000
```
- **Output**: 
```
4
```
- **Explanation**: Swap cow 2 with cow 1. Now cow 2 (rating 1000000000) wins all matches since it is the strongest.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases, and performance considerations.
