>
? 6 7 92 93
<
...
? 0 98 1 99
>
! 98 99
```
**Explanation**: Large permutation with one hundred elements. The queries are designed to find the pair with the maximum OR value by comparing pairs of elements.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5000
```
**Output**: 
```
? 0 1 4998 4999
<  # Assuming p=[0,1,2,3,...,4999]
? 2 3 4996 4997
<
? 4 5 4994 4995
>
...
? 0 4998 1 4999
>
! 4998 4999
```
**Explanation**: Largest possible permutation with five thousand elements. The queries are designed to find the pair with the maximum OR value efficiently.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10000
```
**Output**: 
```
? 0 1 9998 9999
<  # Assuming p=[0,1,2,3,...,9999]
? 2 3 9996 9997

>
...
? 0 9998 1 9999
>
! 9998 9999
```
**Explanation**: Maximum possible permutation with ten thousand elements. The queries are designed to find the pair with the maximum OR value efficiently.
