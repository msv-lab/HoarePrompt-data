### Edge Test Cases

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2

```
**Output**: 
```
TRIANGLE
```
**Explanation**: An upside-down triangle with k=1 is not possible, but a triangle with k=1 is not valid either. However, this case is invalid as per the problem statement, but for completeness, it should not be considered. Here, it should be a triangle with k=2.

**Input**: 
```
1
2
10
01
```
**Output**: 
```
TRIANGLE
```
**Explanation**: A triangle with k=1 is not possible, but a triangle with k=1 is not valid either. However, this case is invalid as per the problem statement, but for completeness, it should not be considered. Here, it should be a triangle with k=2.
