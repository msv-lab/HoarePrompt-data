# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Alice can take 1000000000 stones from the pile, leaving all piles empty and losing the game.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 1 1 ... 1 (100000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Alice can take 1 stone from each pile, leaving all piles empty and losing the game. This tests the scalability of the solution with a large number of piles.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Alice can take 1000000000 stones from each pile, leaving all piles empty and losing the game. This tests the scalability of the solution with large pile sizes.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1000000000 1000000000 ... 1000000000 (100000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Alice can take 1000000000 stones from each pile, leaving all piles empty and losing the game. This tests the scalability of the solution with both a large number of piles and large pile sizes.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 3 ... 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can take 1 stone from each pile, leaving piles of size 0, 1, 2, ..., 99999. Bob can take 1 stone from the remaining piles, leaving piles of size 0, 0, 1, ..., 99998. Alice can continue this process until she leaves all piles empty, winning the game. This tests the scalability of the solution with a large number of piles and varying pile sizes.
