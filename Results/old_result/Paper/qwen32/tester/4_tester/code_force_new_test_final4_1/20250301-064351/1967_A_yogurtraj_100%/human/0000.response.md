1
```
**Output**: 
```
11
```
# Explanation: 
- We have 1 type of card and 10 coins. We can buy 10 more cards of type 1, resulting in 11 cards of type 1. The only possible subarray is of length 1, and there are 11 such subarrays.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 4
8 4
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
# Explanation: 
- We have 2 types of cards and 4 coins. We can buy 2 cards of type 1 and 2 cards of type 2, resulting in 10 cards of type 1 and 6 cards of type 2. The optimal arrangement is [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2], which gives us 8 subarrays of [1, 2] and 7 subarrays of [2, 1], totaling 15 subarrays.

```
1
3 4
6 1 8
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
# Explanation: 
- We have 3 types of cards and 4 coins. The optimal strategy is to buy 2 cards of type 2 and 2 cards of type 3, resulting in 6 cards of type 1, 3 cards of type 2, and 10 cards of type 3. The optimal arrangement will give us 15 subarrays that are permutations of [1, 2, 3].

3 9
7 6 2
```
**Output**: 
```
22
```
# Explanation: 
- We have 3 types of cards and 9 coins. We can buy 3 cards of type 2 and 6 cards of type 3, resulting in 7 cards of type 1, 9 cards of type 2, and 8 cards of type 3. The optimal arrangement will give us 22 subarrays that are permutations of [1, 2, 3].

```
28
```
# Explanation: 
- We have 5 types of cards and 3 coins. The optimal strategy is to buy 1 card of type 4, 1 card of type 5, and 1 card of type 3, resulting in 6 cards of type 1, 6 cards of type 2, 8 cards of type 3, 5 cards of type 4, and 7 cards of type 5. The optimal arrangement will give us 28 subarrays that are permutations of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

# Explanation: 
- We have 9 types of cards and 7 coins. The optimal strategy is to buy 1 card of type 3, 1 card of type 6, 1 card of type 7, 1 card of type 8, 1 card of type 9, and 2 cards of type 1, resulting in 8 cards of type 1, 6 cards of type 2, 2 cards of type 3, 7 cards of type 4, 6 cards of type 5, 3 cards of type 6, 5 cards of type 7, 4 cards of type 8, and 4 cards of type 9. The optimal arrangement will give us 32 subarrays that are permutations of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].

# Test 7

# Explanation: 
- We have 10 types of cards and 10 coins. The optimal strategy is to buy 1 card of type 1, 1 card of type 2, 1 card of type 3, 1 card of type 4, 1 card of type 5, 1 card of type 6, 1 card of type 7, 1 card of type 8, 1 card of type 9, and 1 card of type 10, resulting in 2 cards of type 1, 4 cards of type 2, 2 cards of type 3, 3 cards of type 4, 2 cards of type 5, 10 cards of type 6, 4 cards of type 7, 6 cards of type 8, 8 cards of type 9, and 6 cards of type 10. The optimal arrangement will give us 36 subarrays that are permutations of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

# Explanation: 
- We have 9 types of cards and 8 coins. The optimal strategy is to buy 1 card of type 1, 1 card of type 5, 1 card of type 6, 1 card of type 7, 1 card of type 8, and 3 cards of type 9, resulting in 6 cards of type 1, 8 cards of type 2, 7 cards of type 3, 5 cards of type 4, 2 cards of type 5, 4 cards of type 6, 3 cards of type 7, 10 cards of type 8, and 11 cards of type 9.
