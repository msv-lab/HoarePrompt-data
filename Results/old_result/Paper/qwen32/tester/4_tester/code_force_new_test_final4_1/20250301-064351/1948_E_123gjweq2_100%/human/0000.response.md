Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem. These test cases will cover basic scenarios as well as edge cases to ensure the robustness, reliability, and scalability of the solution.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2
1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: For n=2, k=3, all vertices can be in the same clique since the condition |i-j| + |a_i-a_j| is always satisfied.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 3 2
2
1 2 1
```
**Explanation**: For n=3, k=2, vertices 1 and 3 can be in one clique, and vertex 2 can be in another clique.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4
1
1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: For n=4, k=4, all vertices can be in the same clique since the condition is always satisfied.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 3 2 5 4
3
1 2 1 3 2
```
**Explanation**: For n=5, k=3, vertices can be partitioned into three cliques based on the given condition.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2
2
1 2
```
**Explanation**: For n=2, k=1, vertices cannot be in the same clique since |i-j| + |a_i-a_j| = 2, which is greater than k.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 3 2 4
2
1 2 1 2
```
**Explanation**: For n=4, k=2, vertices can be partitioned into two cliques based on the given condition.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 3 5 2 4
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Explanation**: For n=5, k=1, each vertex must be in its own clique since the condition is never satisfied.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
8 15
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: For n=8, k=15, all vertices can be in the same clique since the condition is always satisfied.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
40 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40
20
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2
```
**Explanation**: For n=40, k=2, vertices can be partitioned into 20 cliques based on the given condition.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
40 80
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: For n=40, k=80, all vertices can be in the same clique since the condition is always satisfied.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including basic functionality and edge cases, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
