**Input**: 
```
3
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The disks are tangent but cannot be adjusted to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
3
0 0 1
0 1 1
1 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The disks are tangent but cannot be adjusted to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
4
0 0 1
0 2 1
2 0 1
2 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The disks are tangent but cannot be adjusted to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1000
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
3 0 1
...
999 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: A large number of tangent disks cannot be adjusted to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
3
0 0 1000000000
1000000000 0 1000000000
2000000000 0 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The disks can be adjusted so that they remain tangent and the sum of radii decreases.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
2
-1000000000 -1000000000 1
1000000000 1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The disks are tangent but cannot be adjusted to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
2
-1000000000 0 1
1000000000 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The disks are tangent but cannot be adjusted to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
2
0 -1000000000 1
0 1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The disks are tangent but cannot be adjusted to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
2
0 0 1
0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The disks overlap, which is not allowed by the problem statement.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust, reliable, and scalable.
