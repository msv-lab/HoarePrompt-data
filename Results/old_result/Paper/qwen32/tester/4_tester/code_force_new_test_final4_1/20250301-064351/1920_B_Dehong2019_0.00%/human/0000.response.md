Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, including both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes the only element, resulting in an empty array with a sum of 0.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1 1
3 1 2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Alice does not remove any elements. Bob flips 4 to -4, resulting in a sum of 3 + 1 + 2 - 4 = 2.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
6 6 3
1 4 3 2 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes all elements, resulting in an empty array with a sum of 0.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 6 1
3 7 3 3 32 15
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes the largest elements (32, 15, 7, 3, 3, 3) in order to minimize the impact of Bob's flip. Bob flips the smallest remaining element (3) to -3, resulting in a sum of 0 - 3 = -3. However, Alice could remove 32, 15, 7, 3, 3, and keep 3, and Bob flips 3 to -3, resulting in a sum of 3 - 3 = 0.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
8 5 3
5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
-5
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes the largest elements (9, 9, 5, 5, 3) in order to minimize the impact of Bob's flip. Bob flips the smallest remaining elements (3, 3, 2) to -3, -3, and -2, resulting in a sum of -5.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10 6 4
1 8 2 9 3 3 4 5 3 200
```
**Output**: 
```
-9
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes the largest elements (200, 9, 8, 5, 4, 3) in order to minimize the impact of Bob's flip. Bob flips the smallest remaining elements (3, 3, 3, 2, 1) to -3, -3, -3, -2, and -1, resulting in a sum of -9.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 1
4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-7
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes both elements, resulting in an empty array with a sum of 0. However, if Alice removes only the larger element (4), Bob flips the remaining element (3) to -3, resulting in a sum of -7.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 2
4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-7
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes the larger element (4). Bob flips both remaining elements (3 and the removed 4) to -3 and -4, resulting in a sum of -7.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 3 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes the only element, resulting in an empty array with a sum of 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 3
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes the only element, resulting in an empty array with a sum of 0.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes the smaller element (3). Bob flips the remaining element (4) to -4, resulting in a sum of 4 - 4 = 0. However, if Alice does not remove any element, Bob flips the smaller element (3) to -3, resulting in a sum of 4 - 3 = 1. The optimal move for Alice is to not remove any element and let Bob flip the smallest element, resulting in a sum of 4 - 3 = 1.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2 2
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes the two largest elements (5, 4). Bob flips the two smallest remaining elements (1, 2) to -1 and -2, resulting in a sum of 3 - 1 - 2 = 0. However, if Alice removes 5 and 3, Bob flips 1 and 2 to -1 and -2, resulting in a sum of 4 - 1 - 2 = 1. The optimal move for Alice is to remove 5 and 4, and let Bob flip 1 and 2, resulting in a sum of 3 - 1 - 2 = 0.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3 3
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes the three largest elements (5, 4, 3). Bob flips the two smallest remaining elements (1, 2) to -1 and -2, resulting in a sum of 0.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes all elements, resulting in an empty array with a sum of 0.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
5 0 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
-15
```
**Explanation**: Alice does not remove any elements. Bob flips all elements to -1, -2, -3, -4, and -5, resulting in a sum of -15.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
5 0 0
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
**Explanation**: Alice does not remove any elements. Bob does not flip any elements, resulting in a sum of 15.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1 0
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes the smallest element (1). Bob does not flip any elements, resulting in a sum of 15 - 1 = 14. However, if Alice removes the largest element (5), Bob does not flip any elements, resulting in a sum of 15 - 5 = 10. The optimal move for Alice is to not remove any element, resulting in a sum of 15.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
5 0 1
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
13
```
**Explanation**: Alice does not remove any elements. Bob flips the smallest element (1) to -1, resulting in a sum of 13.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2 1
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes the two smallest elements (1, 2). Bob flips the smallest remaining element (3) to -3, resulting in a sum of 9 - 3 = 6. However, if Alice removes 1 and 3, Bob flips 2 to -2, resulting in a sum of 9 - 2 = 7. The optimal move for Alice is to remove 1 and 2, and let Bob flip 3, resulting in a sum of 10 - 3 = 7.

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2 2
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes the two largest elements (5, 4). Bob flips the two smallest remaining elements (1, 2) to -1 and -2, resulting in a sum of 3 - 1 - 2 = 0. However, if Alice removes 5 and 3, Bob flips 1 and 2 to -1 and -2, resulting in a sum of 4 - 1 - 2 = 1. The optimal move for Alice is to remove 5 and 4, and let Bob flip 1 and 2, resulting in a sum
