# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Comment**: Both strings are of length 1 and identical, so the entire string `a` is a subsequence of `b`.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
0
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Comment**: The strings are of length 1 but different, so `a` is not a subsequence of `b`.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1

1
1111111111
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Comment**: `a` is a single '1' and `b` contains multiple '1's, so the entire string `a` is a subsequence of `b`.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
1111111111
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Comment**: `a` is a string of '1's and `b` is a single '0', so `a` is not a subsequence of `b`.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5
10101
10101
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Comment**: Both strings are identical, so the entire string `a` is a subsequence of `b`.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5
10101
11111
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Comment**: `a` is a binary string and `b` contains all '1's, so `a` is a subsequence of `b` by ignoring '0's.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5
10101
00000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Comment**: `a` contains '1's and `b` contains all '0's, so `a` is not a subsequence of `b`.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 100000
111...111  # 100000 '1's
111...111  # 100000 '1's
```
**Output**: 
```
100000
```
**Comment**: Both strings are of maximum length and identical, so the entire string `a` is a subsequence of `b`.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 100000
111...111  # 100000 '1's
000...000  # 100000 '0's
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Comment**: `a` contains '1's and `b` contains all '0's, so `a` is not a subsequence of `b`.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 1
111...111  # 100000 '1's
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Comment**: `a` is a long string of '1's and `b` is a single '0', so `a` is not a subsequence of `b`.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1 100000
1
111...111  # 100000 '1's
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Comment**: `a` is a single '1' and `b` is a long string of '1's, so the entire string `a` is a subsequence of `b`.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1

```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Comment**: `a` is a binary string and `b` contains all '1's, so `a` is a subsequence of `b` by ignoring '0's.

# Test 14
**Input**:
