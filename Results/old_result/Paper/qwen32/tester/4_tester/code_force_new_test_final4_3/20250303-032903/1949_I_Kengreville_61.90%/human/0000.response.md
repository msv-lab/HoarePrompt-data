# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Only one disk exists, so it's impossible to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining the conditions.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
2
0 0 1
1 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The disks are tangent to each other. We can decrease both radii by 0.5.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2
0 0 1
2 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The disks are not tangent to each other and the sum of radii cannot be decreased without causing overlap.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
3
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The disks are not tangent to each other and the sum of radii cannot be decreased without causing overlap.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
3
0 0 1
1 0 1
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The disks are tangent to each other in a triangular formation. We can decrease all radii by 0.333.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
4
0 0 1
1 0 1
1 1 1
0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The disks form a square. We can decrease all radii by 0.25.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
4
0 0 1
2 0 1
2 2 1
0 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The disks form a larger square. We can decrease all radii by 0.25.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
4
0 0 1
2 0 1
2 2 2
0 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The disks form an L-shape with the larger disk in the middle. It's impossible to decrease the sum of radii without causing overlap.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
5
0 0 1
1 0 1
1 1 1
0 1 1
2 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The disks form a larger square with an additional disk in the middle. It's impossible to decrease the sum of radii without causing overlap.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
3
0 0 1000000000
1000000000 0 1000000000
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The disks are very large and far apart. It's impossible to decrease the sum of radii without causing overlap.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
3
0 0 1
1 0 1
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The disks are tangent to each other in a triangular formation. We can decrease all radii by 0.333.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1000
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
...
999 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 1000 disks in a line with a gap of 1 between each. It's impossible to decrease the sum of radii without causing overlap.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1000
0 0 1
0 1 1
0 2 1
...
0 999 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 1000 disks in a column with a gap of 1 between each. It's impossible to decrease the sum of radii without causing overlap.

# Test 14
