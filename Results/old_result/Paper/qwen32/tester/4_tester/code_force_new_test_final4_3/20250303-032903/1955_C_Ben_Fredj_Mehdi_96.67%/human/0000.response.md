Sure, here are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem:

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
1 2 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the first ship, then the last, and so on. The first ship sinks after the first attack, the last ship after the second attack, and the first ship again after the third attack. The fourth attack sinks the new first ship, and the fifth attack does not sink any ship as there are only two ships left.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 6
1 2 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Similar to Test 1, but the Kraken attacks one more time, sinking the last ship in the third attack and the first ship in the fourth attack. The fifth attack sinks the new first ship, and the sixth attack sinks the last remaining ship.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5 20
2 7 1 8 2
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the first ship, then the last, and so on. All ships will eventually sink after a sufficient number of attacks. Since there are 5 ships and the Kraken attacks 20 times, all ships will be sunk.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the first ship, reducing its durability to 2, and then attacks the last ship, reducing its durability to 1. Neither ship sinks after these two attacks.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 15
1 5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the first ship, reducing its durability to 0 and sinking it. Then it attacks the last ship, reducing its durability to 4, 3, 2, 1, and finally 0, sinking it. All attacks after the fifth one do not sink any ship as both ships have already sunk.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 5
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the only ship, reducing its durability to 0 and sinking it. All subsequent attacks do not affect the ship as it has already sunk.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the only ship, reducing its durability to 4. The ship does not sink after this attack.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10
10
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the only ship 10 times, reducing its durability to 0 after the 10th attack. The ship does not sink after the first 9 attacks.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
3 3
1 1 1
3 3
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
3
```
**Explanation**: In both cases, the Kraken attacks each ship once, reducing their durability to 0 and sinking all three ships.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 100
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks each ship 10 times, reducing their durability to 0 and sinking all ten ships.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the first ship once, reducing its durability to 0 and sinking it. No other ships are attacked.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10 50
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks each ship enough times to sink them all. The first ship sinks after 1 attack, the second after 2 attacks, and so on, until the last ship sinks after 10 attacks. All ships are sunk after 50 attacks.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10 45
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: Similar to Test 12, but the Kraken attacks 45 times, which is more than enough to sink all ships. The first ship sinks after 1 attack, the second after 2 attacks, and so on, until the last ship sinks after 10 attacks. All ships are sunk after 50 attacks.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10 44
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks 44 times. The first ship sinks after 1 attack, the second after 2 attacks, and so on, until the ninth ship sinks after 9 attacks. The tenth ship is not attacked enough times to sink (it requires 10 attacks).

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
10 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks 9 times. The first ship sinks after 1 attack, the second after 2 attacks, and so on, until the ninth ship sinks after 9 attacks. The tenth ship is not attacked enough times to sink (it requires 10 attacks).

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the first ship once, reducing its durability to 0 and sinking it. No other ships are attacked.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks each ship once, reducing their durability to 0 and sinking all ten ships.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
10 9
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the first ship once, reducing its durability to 0 and sinking it. Then it attacks the last ship, reducing its durability to 0 and sinking it. This process continues until the ninth ship is sunk. The tenth ship is not attacked enough times to sink (it requires 1 attack).

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0

```
1
10 10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks each ship once, reducing their durability to 0 and sinking the first nine ships. The tenth ship is not attacked enough times to sink (it requires 2 attacks).

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases, and extreme conditions, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the solution.
