```
**Output**: 
```
2000000000000000002
```
**Explanation**: Fireworks from both installations overlap every minute for 10^18 minutes, resulting in a maximum of 2 * 10^18 + 2 fireworks visible at the same time.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 5
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: Fireworks from both installations overlap every 10 minutes for 6 minutes, resulting in a maximum of 7 fireworks visible at the same time (3 from each installation and 1 from the overlap).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
3000000000000000002
```
**Explanation**: Fireworks from both installations overlap every 10^18 minutes for 10^18 minutes, resulting in a maximum of 3 * 10^18 + 2 fireworks visible at the same time.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Fireworks from the first installation launch every minute, and fireworks from the second installation launch every 2 minutes, resulting in a maximum of 3 fireworks visible at the same time (1 from the first installation and 2 from the second installation at the start and end of their visibility periods).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: Fireworks from the first installation launch every 2 minutes, and fireworks from the second installation launch every 3 minutes, resulting in a maximum of 6 fireworks visible at the same time (3 from each installation at the start and end of their visibility periods).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3 0
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Fireworks from the first installation launch every 2 minutes, and fireworks from the second installation launch every 3 minutes, resulting in a maximum of 2 fireworks visible at the same time (1 from each installation at the start of their visibility periods).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000000000002
```
**Explanation**: Fireworks from the first installation launch every minute, and fireworks from the second installation launch every 10^18 minutes, resulting in a maximum of 10^18 + 2 fireworks visible at the same time.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000000000002
```
**Explanation**: Fireworks from the first installation launch every 10^18 minutes, and fireworks from the second installation launch every minute, resulting in a maximum of 10^18 + 2 fireworks visible at the same time.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases with large numbers, and cases with overlapping visibility periods.
