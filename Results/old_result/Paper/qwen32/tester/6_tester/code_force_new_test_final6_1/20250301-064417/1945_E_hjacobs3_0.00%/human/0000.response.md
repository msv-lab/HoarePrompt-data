Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The permutation is already sorted, and the element 3 is already at the correct position.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 5
3 1 6 5 2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1
3 4
```
**Explanation**: By swapping elements at positions 3 and 4, the permutation becomes [3, 1, 5, 6, 2, 4]. After binary search, p_l will be 5.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
**Output**: 
```
2
4 5
2 4
```
**Explanation**: By swapping elements at positions 4 and 5, then 2 and 4, the permutation becomes [4, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6]. After binary search, p_l will be 3.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: By swapping elements at positions 1 and 2, the permutation becomes [2, 3, 1]. After binary search, p_l will be 2.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The permutation of size 1 is already sorted and the element is at the correct position.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: By swapping elements at positions 1 and 2, the permutation becomes [1, 2]. After binary search, p_l will be 1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The permutation is already sorted, and the element 2 is already at the correct position.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Explanation**: By swapping elements at positions 2 and 3, the permutation becomes [3, 1, 2]. After binary search, p_l will be 3.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 3
```
**Explanation**: By swapping elements at positions 1 and 3, the permutation becomes [1, 2, 3]. After binary search, p_l will be 1.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 100000
100000 99999 99998 ... 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 100000
```
**Explanation**: By swapping the first and last elements, the permutation becomes sorted. After binary search, p_l will be 100000.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 1
100000 99999 99998 ... 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 100000
```
**Explanation**: By swapping the first and last elements, the permutation becomes sorted. After binary search, p_l will be 1.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
2
2 1
2 1
2 2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 2
1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: Each test case requires a single swap to sort the permutation and find the element.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases with small and large inputs, and multiple test cases in a single input.
