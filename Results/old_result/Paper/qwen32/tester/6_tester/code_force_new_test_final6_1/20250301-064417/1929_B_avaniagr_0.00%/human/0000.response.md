Sure, let's create comprehensive test cases for the given problem. We'll start with basic test cases and then move on to edge cases.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
3 4
3 3
3 10
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
6
```
**Explanation**: 
- For a 3x3 grid, we need at least 4 diagonals with colored cells. Coloring 2 cells can achieve this.
- For 3 diagonals, 2 cells are still sufficient.
- For 10 diagonals, which is more than the possible diagonals (8), we need to color all diagonals. Hence, 6 cells are required.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
2
4 7
7 11
```
**Output**: 
```
4
6
```
**Explanation**: 
- For a 4x4 grid, we need at least 7 diagonals. Coloring 4 cells can achieve this.
- For a 7x7 grid, we need at least 11 diagonals. Coloring 6 cells can achieve this.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2
2 3
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
```
**Explanation**: 
- For a 2x2 grid, we need at least 3 diagonals. Coloring 2 cells can achieve this.
- For 2 diagonals, 2 cells are still sufficient.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: 
- For a 2x2 grid, we need at least 1 diagonal. Coloring 1 cell is sufficient.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
- For a 2x2 grid, we need all 4 diagonals. Coloring 2 cells is sufficient.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: 
- For a very large grid, we need at least 1 diagonal. Coloring 1 cell is sufficient.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 399999996
```
**Output**: 
```
199999998
```
**Explanation**: 
- For a very large grid, we need a large number of diagonals. The number of cells needed is calculated based on the formula derived from the problem.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 399999998
```
**Output**: 
```
199999999
```
**Explanation**: 
- For a very large grid, we need almost all diagonals. The number of cells needed is calculated based on the formula derived from the problem.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 399999999
```
**Output**: 
```
199999999
```
**Explanation**: 
- For a very large grid, we need almost all diagonals. The number of cells needed is calculated based on the formula derived from the problem.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 399999997
```
**Output**: 
```
199999999
```
**Explanation**: 
- For a very large grid, we need almost all diagonals. The number of cells needed is calculated based on the formula derived from the problem.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality and edge conditions, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the solution.
