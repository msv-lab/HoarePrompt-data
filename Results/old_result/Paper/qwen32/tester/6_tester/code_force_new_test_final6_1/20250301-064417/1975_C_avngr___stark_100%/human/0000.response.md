Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
2
2
1 2
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
4
```
**Explanation**: The first test case is from the example, where the only operation possible results in the array [1,1]. The second test case is also from the example, where we can achieve the array [4,4,4,4,4].

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The median of the entire array [1, 3, 2] is 2, so the array can be changed to [2, 2, 2].

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The array already contains only the same number, so no operation is needed.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: Similar to the previous test case, the array is already uniform.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The median of [1000000000, 1] is 1, so the array can be changed to [1, 1].

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Explanation**: The median of the entire array is 50000, so the array can be changed to [50000, 50000, ..., 50000].

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The median of the entire array [1, 1, 2, 2, 2] is 2, so the array can be changed to [2, 2, 2, 2, 2].

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
5
2 2 2 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The median of the entire array [2, 2, 2, 1, 1] is 2, so the array can be changed to [2, 2, 2, 2, 2].

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The median of the entire array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] is 3.5, but the floor of 3.5 is 3, so the array can be changed to [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3].

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The median of the entire array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] is 4, so the array can be changed to [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4].

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The median of the entire array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] is 4.5, but the floor of 4.5 is 4, so the array can be changed to [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4].

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: The median of the entire array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] is 5, so the array can be changed to [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5].

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including basic operations, edge cases with large numbers, and arrays with varying lengths and values.
