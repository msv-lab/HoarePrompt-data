```
6
```
**Explanation**: For a 7x7 grid, we need at least 11 diagonals to have a colored cell. Coloring cells in a specific pattern will cover 11 diagonals.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: For a 2x2 grid, we need at least 3 diagonals to have a colored cell. Coloring two cells diagonally opposite each other will cover 3 diagonals.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: For a 2x2 grid, we need at least 2 diagonals to have a colored cell. Coloring one cell will cover 2 diagonals.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 400000000
```
**Output**: 
```
100000000
```
**Explanation**: For a very large grid (10^8 x 10^8), we need to cover 400000000 diagonals. Since the number of diagonals is 4n-2, we need to color one cell in each row or column to cover all diagonals.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: For a very large grid (10^8 x 10^8), we need to cover only 2 diagonals. Coloring one cell will cover 2 diagonals.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: For a 2x2 grid, we need at least 1 diagonal to have a colored cell. Coloring one cell will cover 2 diagonals, which is more than enough.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
5 8
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: For a 5x5 grid, we need at least 8 diagonals to have a colored cell. Coloring cells in a specific pattern will cover 8 diagonals.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
5 18
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: For a 5x5 grid, we need at least 18 diagonals to have a colored cell. Coloring cells in a specific pattern will cover 18 diagonals.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10 38
```
**Output**: 
```
18
```
**Explanation**: For a 10x10 grid, we need at least 38 diagonals to have a colored cell. Coloring cells in a specific pattern will cover 38 diagonals.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
10 39
```
**Output**: 
```
19
```
**Explanation**: For a 10x10 grid, we need at least 39 diagonals to have a colored cell. Coloring cells in a specific pattern will cover 39 diagonals.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
10 40
```
**Output**: 
```
20
```
**Explanation**: For a 10x10 grid, we need at least 40 diagonals to have a colored cell. Coloring cells in a specific pattern will cover 40 diagonals.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
10 41
```
**Output**: 
```
20
```
**Explanation**: For a 10x10 grid, we need at least 41 diagonals to have a colored cell. Since there are only 4n-2=38 diagonals, we need to color cells in such a way that all diagonals are covered, which is 20 cells.
