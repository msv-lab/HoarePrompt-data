Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem, including both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
3 2 7
```
**Output**: 
```
27 41 12
```
**Explanation**: This is a basic test case where the solution exists. The bets are chosen such that the total bet is less than the return for each winning outcome.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
```
**Explanation**: This is a simple test case where the bets can be as low as 1 coin each, and the total bet is 2, which is less than the return for each winning outcome.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This is a test case where all multipliers are the same, and it's impossible to distribute the bets such that the total bet is less than the return for each winning outcome.

**Input**: 
```
1
6
7 9 3 17 9 13
```
**Output**: 
```
1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071
```
**Explanation**: This is a more complex test case with varying multipliers. The bets are chosen such that the total bet is less than the return for each winning outcome.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
6 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This is a test case where the multipliers are such that it's impossible to distribute the bets to meet the conditions.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
9 4 6 8 3
```
**Output**: 
```
8 18 12 9 24
```
**Explanation**: This is another test case with varying multipliers. The bets are chosen such that the total bet is less than the return for each winning outcome.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This is the simplest possible test case with only one outcome. The bet can be as low as 1 coin, and the return will be 2 coins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1
20
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This is a test case with the maximum multiplier. The bet can be as low as 1 coin, and the return will be 20 coins.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
50
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This is a test case with the maximum number of outcomes, all having the same multiplier. It's impossible to distribute the bets to meet the conditions.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
50
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11

```
**Explanation**: This is a test case with the maximum number of outcomes and varying multipliers. The bets are chosen such that the total bet is less than the return for each winning outcome.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
10000
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
1
1
...
1
1
```
**Explanation**: This is a stress test case with the maximum number of test cases. Each test case has only one outcome with a multiplier of 2. The bet can be as low as 1 coin for each test case.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
