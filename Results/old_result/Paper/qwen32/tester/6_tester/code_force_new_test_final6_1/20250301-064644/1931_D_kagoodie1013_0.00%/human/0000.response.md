# Edge Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```

```
1
```
**Explanation**: The only pair (1, 2) is beautiful since 1000000000 + 1000000000 = 2000000000 and 1000000000 - 1000000000 = 0, both divisible by 1000000000.

# Edge Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 2 2
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 ... (alternating 1s and 2s)
```
**Output**: 
```
2499950000
```
**Explanation**: Every pair (i, j) where i and j have different parity forms a beautiful pair.

# Edge Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... (all 1s)
```
**Output**: 
```
4999950000
```
**Explanation**: Every pair (i, j) forms a beautiful pair since both sum and difference are divisible by 1.

# Edge Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 3
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The only pair (1, 2) is not beautiful since 1 + 2 = 3 (divisible by 3 but not by 2) and 1 - 2 = -1 (not divisible by 3).

**Input**: 
```
1
2 3 2
3 6
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The only pair (1, 2) is beautiful since 3 + 6 = 9 (divisible by 3) and 3 - 6 = -3 (divisible by 2).
