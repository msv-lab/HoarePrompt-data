Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
3 2 7
```
**Output**: 
```
27 41 12
```
**Explanation**: This is a basic test case with a small number of outcomes and multipliers. The provided output is one of the valid solutions.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
```
**Explanation**: This is a basic test case with equal multipliers. The simplest solution is to bet 1 coin on each outcome.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This is a basic test case where all multipliers are the same and equal to 5. Since the total bet must be strictly less than the return for any winning outcome, it is impossible to find a valid distribution.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6
7 9 3 17 9 13
```
**Output**: 
```
1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071
```
**Explanation**: This is a basic test case with a mix of different multipliers. The provided output is one of the valid solutions.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
6 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This is a basic test case where the multipliers are not sufficient to ensure a valid distribution, making it impossible to come out ahead in all scenarios.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
9 4 6 8 3
```
**Output**: 
```
8 18 12 9 24
```
**Explanation**: This is a basic test case with varying multipliers. The provided output is one of the valid solutions.

# Edge Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This is an edge test case with only one outcome. The simplest solution is to bet 1 coin.

# Edge Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
50
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This is an edge test case with the maximum number of outcomes (50) and all multipliers equal to 2. It is impossible to find a valid distribution.

# Edge Test 9
**Input**: 
```

```
**Explanation**: This is an edge test case with the maximum number of test cases (10,000). Each test case has only one outcome with a multiplier of 2. The simplest solution is to bet 1 coin in each test case.

# Edge Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
50
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
