Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to choose `i=2`, `j=5`, `x=1` which results in the array `[1,1,1,1,1,1]` with a cost of `4` burles.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already uniform, so no operation is needed.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
8
8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to choose `i=4`, `j=5`, `x=8` which results in the array `[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]` with a cost of `2` burles.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array has only one element, so no operation is needed.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to choose `i=2`, `j=2`, `x=1` which results in the array `[1,1]` with a cost of `1` burle.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to choose `i=2`, `j=3`, `x=1` which results in the array `[1,1,1]` with a cost of `2` burles.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
7
4 3 2 7 1 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to choose `i=1`, `j=7`, `x=1` which results in the array `[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]` with a cost of `7-1+1=7` burles. However, a better choice is `i=1`, `j=3`, `x=1` and then `i=4`, `j=7`, `x=1` which results in `[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]` with a cost of `3+4=7` burles. But the optimal solution is to choose `i=1`, `j=3`, `x=1` and then `i=4`, `j=7`, `x=1` with a cost of `3+3=6` burles.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
9
9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to choose `i=3`, `j=9`, `x=9` which results in the array `[9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9]` with a cost of `9-3+1=7` burles.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 199999 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
199999
```
**Explanation**: The array has elements from `1` to `200000`, and the optimal operation is to choose `i=1`, `j=200000`, `x=1` which results in the array `[1,1,1,...,1]` with a cost of `200000-1+1=200000` burles.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already uniform, so no operation is needed.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to choose `i=5`, `j=8`, `x=1` which results in the array `[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]` with a cost of `4` burles.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to choose `i=2`, `j=9`, `x=5` which results in the array `[1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1]` with a cost of `8` burles. However, a better choice is `i=2`, `j=5`, `x=5` and then `i=6`, `j=9`, `x=5` which results in `[1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1]` with a cost of `4+2=6` burles.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10
5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already uniform, so no operation is needed.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
10000
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
0
0
0
...
0
0
0
0
```
**Explanation**: Each test case has a single element array, so no operation is needed for each test case.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already uniform, so no operation is needed.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including small arrays, large arrays, uniform arrays, and arrays with a mix of values. They also test the edge cases such as the smallest possible array and the largest possible array.
