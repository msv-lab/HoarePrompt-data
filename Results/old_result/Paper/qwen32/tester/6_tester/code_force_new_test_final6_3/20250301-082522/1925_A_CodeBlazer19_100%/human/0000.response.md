**Input**: 
```
1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
ab
```
**Explanation**: Two strings of length 1 can be formed using the first 2 alphabets, "a" and "b". Both are present in "ab".

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**:

```
**Explanation**: Only one string of length 2 can be formed using the first 1 alphabet, which is "aa".

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
baab
```
**Explanation**: Four strings of length 2 can be formed using the first 2 alphabets: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb". All are present in "baab".

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
abcbac
```
**Explanation**: Nine strings of length 2 can be formed using the first 3 alphabets: "aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc". All are present in "abcbac".

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
aaa
```
**Explanation**: Only one string of length 3 can be formed using the first 1 alphabet, which is "aaa".

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
baaabbaabb
```
**Explanation**: Eight strings of length 3 can be formed using the first 2 alphabets: "aaa", "aab", "aba", "abb", "baa", "bab", "bba", "bbb". All are present in "baaabbaabb".

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
abcbacbcac
```
**Explanation**: Twenty-seven strings of length 3 can be formed using the first 3 alphabets. All are present in "abcbacbcac".

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
26 26
```
**Output**: 
```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz... (repeated many times)
```
**Explanation**: This is the maximum possible length (n=26) using all 26 alphabets. The output string will be very long, but it must contain all possible 26^26 subsequences of length 26.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
676
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2
2 3
3 1
3 2
3 3
...
26 26
```
**Output**: 
```
a
ab
aa
baab
abcbac
aaa
baaabbaabb
abcbacbcac
...
<very long string for 26 26>
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers all possible combinations of n and k within the given constraints.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1 26
```
**Output**: 
```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Explanation**: All 26 single-character strings are present in "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2 26
```
**Output**: 
```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Explanation**: This ensures that all possible 2-character strings are present as subsequences.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
25 26
```
**Output**: 
```
<very long string>
```
**Explanation**: This tests the largest possible n (25) with all 26 alphabets, ensuring all 26^25 subsequences are present.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.
