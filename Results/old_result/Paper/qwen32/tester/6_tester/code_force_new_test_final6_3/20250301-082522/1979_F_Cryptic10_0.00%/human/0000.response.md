Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the described problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the robustness, reliability, and scalability of the solution.

### Basic Test Cases

**Test 1**
**Input**:
```
1
4
```
**Output**:
```
? 3
0 0
? 2
1 4
? 1
2 3
! 4 3 1 2
```
**Explanation**: This is the example provided in the problem description. The graph is a complete graph with 4 vertices, and two edges are removed.

**Test 2**
**Input**:
```
1
4
```
**Output**:
```
? 3
1 0
? 0
4 2
! 4 1 2 3
```
**Explanation**: Another example from the problem description. The graph is a complete graph with 4 vertices, and two edges are removed.

**Test 3**
**Input**:
```
1
2
```
**Output**:
```
? 0
1 0
! 2 1
```
**Explanation**: The graph consists of 2 vertices connected by an edge. The simplest case.

### Edge Test Cases

**Test 4**
**Input**:
```
1
2
```
**Output**:
```
? 1
0 0
? 0
1 0
! 2 1
```
**Explanation**: Testing the boundary condition where the degree query is higher than possible. The query "? 1" should return "0 0" since there is no vertex with a degree of at least 1 after the first vertex is removed.

**Test 5**
**Input**:
```
1
3
```
**Output**:
```
? 2
1 0
? 1
2 3
! 1 2 3
```
**Explanation**: Testing with 3 vertices. The graph is complete, and one edge is removed. The first query "? 2" will return "1 0" because vertex 1 has a degree of 2, and the only vertex not connected to it is 0 (which is invalid, so it returns 0). The second query "? 1" will return "2 3".

**Test 6**
**Input**:
```
1
5
```
**Output**:
```
? 4
0 0
? 3
1 0
? 2
2 3
? 1
4 5
! 5 4 1 2 3
```
**Explanation**: Testing with 5 vertices. The graph is complete, and three edges are removed. The first query "? 4" will return "0 0" because there is no vertex with a degree of at least 4. The subsequent queries will help in finding the Hamiltonian path.

**Test 7**
**Input**:
```
1
100000
```
**Output**:
```
? 99998
0 0
? 99997
1 0
...
? 0
99999 99998
! 100000 1 2 3 ... 99999
```
**Explanation**: Testing with the maximum number of vertices (100,000). The graph is complete, and 99,998 edges are removed. The queries will help in finding the Hamiltonian path. This test checks the scalability of the solution.

**Test 8**
**Input**:
```
1000
2
```
**Output**:
```
? 0
1 0
! 2 1
? 0
1 0
! 2 1
...
? 0
1 0
! 2 1
```
**Explanation**: Testing with multiple test cases (1000) where each test case has 2 vertices. This checks the handling of multiple test cases and ensures the solution is efficient.

**Test 9**
**Input**:
```
1
3
```
**Output**:
```
? 2
1 0
? 1
2 3
? 0
0 0
! 1 2 3
```
**Explanation**: Testing with 3 vertices. The graph is complete, and one edge is removed. The third query "? 0" will return "0 0" because all vertices are already removed.

**Test 10**
**Input**:
```
1
5
```
**Output**:
```
? 4
0 0
? 3
1 0
? 2
2 3
? 1
4 5
? 0
0 0
! 5 4 1 2 3
```
**Explanation**: Testing with 5 vertices. The graph is complete, and three edges are removed. The fifth query "? 0" will return "0 0" because all vertices are already removed.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases, and scalability.
