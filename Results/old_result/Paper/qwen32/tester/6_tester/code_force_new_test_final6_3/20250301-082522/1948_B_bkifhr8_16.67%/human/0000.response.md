Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem statement. We'll cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the robustness, reliability, and scalability of the solution.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
NO
YES
```

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The array is already sorted.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4
4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The array is in descending order, and no operation can sort it.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
10 20 30 40 50
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: Splitting each element results in a sorted array: [1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0, 5, 0].

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5
99 98 97 96 95
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The array is in descending order, and no operation can sort it.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: Splitting the first element results in [1, 0, 1], which is sorted.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: Splitting the second element results in [9, 1, 0], which can be rearranged to [0, 1, 9].

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
5
10 11 12 13 14
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: Splitting each element results in a sorted array: [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4].

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5
99 98 97 96 95
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The array is in descending order, and no operation can sort it.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The array is already sorted and contains only zeros.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2
10 11
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: Splitting both elements results in [1, 0, 1, 1], which is sorted.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
3
10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: Splitting each element results in [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], which is sorted.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
3
10 20 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: Splitting the first two elements results in [1, 0, 2, 0, 3], which is sorted.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: Splitting the second element results in [1, 1, 0, 1], which can be rearranged to [0, 1, 1, 1].

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 30
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: Splitting the third element results in [1, 2, 3, 0], which can be rearranged to [0, 1, 2, 3].

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including already sorted arrays, descending order arrays, arrays with zeros, and arrays with multiple elements that can be split. They also test the edge cases where the array length is minimal and the elements are at the boundary values.
