Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem. We'll cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the solution is robust, reliable, and scalable.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```

```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick elements to maximize the MEX, while Bob will try to minimize it. One optimal sequence is Alice picks 1, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 0, Bob picks 1. Final array `c` is [1, 0, 0, 1] with MEX 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice and Bob can pick elements such that the final array `c` is [0, 1, 2, 3], and the MEX is 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks 1, Bob picks 1. Final array `c` is [1, 1] with MEX 0.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks 0, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 0. Final array `c` is [0, 0, 0] with MEX 1.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5

```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks 0. Final array `c` is [0] with MEX 1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks 1. Final array `c` is [1] with MEX 0.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks 0, Bob picks 2. Final array `c` is [0, 2] with MEX 1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice and Bob can pick elements such that the final array `c` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], and the MEX is 1.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks 0, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 0, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 0. Final array `c` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] with MEX 1.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice and Bob can pick elements such that the final array `c` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and the MEX is 1.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
6
0 0 1 1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks 1, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 2, Bob picks 1, Alice picks 0, Bob picks 2. Final array `c` is [1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2] with MEX 3.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
0 1 2 3 ... 99999
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice and Bob can pick elements such that the final array `c` contains all numbers from 0 to 99999, and the MEX is 1.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
0 0 0 ... 0 (100000 zeros)
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks 0, Bob picks 0, and so on. Final array `c` is [0, 0, ..., 0] with MEX 1.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
2
1
0
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
```
**Explanation**: First test case: Alice picks 0. Final array `c` is [0] with MEX 1. Second test case: Alice picks 1. Final array `c` is [1] with MEX 0.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
2
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
