```
1
8
5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can force a win by making optimal moves.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose k=1000000000 and win immediately.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose k=1 and win immediately.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Alice must choose k=1, leaving piles as 0 and 0. Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose k=2 and win immediately.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Alice must choose k=1, leaving piles as 0, 0, 0. Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 ... 1 (100000 ones)
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Alice must choose k=1, leaving all piles as 0. Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 ... 1000000000 (100000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose k=1000000000 and win immediately.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
10000
1
1
1
1
...
1 (10000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
Bob
Alice
Bob
...
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alternating between Alice and Bob winning based on the number of test cases.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 3 ... 100000 (increasing sequence)
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can force a win by making optimal moves.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
100000 99999 99998 ... 1 (decreasing sequence)
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can force a win by making optimal moves.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases, and large input sizes, ensuring the code's robustness and reliability.
