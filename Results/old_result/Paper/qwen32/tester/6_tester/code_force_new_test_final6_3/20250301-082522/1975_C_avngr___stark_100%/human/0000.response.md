**Input**: 
```
2
2
1 2
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
4
```

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3
3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The median of any subarray will be either 1 or 2, but the maximum possible value that can fill the entire array is 1.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 3 5 7 9
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: The median of the entire array is 5, and it's the maximum possible value that can fill the entire array.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The median of the subarray [10, 1] is 1, and it's the maximum possible value that can fill the entire array.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The median of the subarray [1, 10] is 1, and it's the maximum possible value that can fill the entire array.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Explanation**: The median of the entire array is 50000, and it's the maximum possible value that can fill the entire array. This test case checks the scalability of the solution.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
100000 100000 100000 ... 100000 (100000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
100000
```
**Explanation**: The array already contains the same number, so no operations are needed. This test case checks the behavior with the maximum possible value and length.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The median of the subarray [1, 1000000000, 1] is 1, and it's the maximum possible value that can fill the entire array. This test case checks the behavior with the maximum possible integer value.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
500
2
1 1000000000
2
1000000000 1
2
1 1
2
1000000000 1000000000
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
1
1000000000
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks multiple scenarios with different values and lengths, ensuring the function can handle multiple test cases efficiently.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases, and scalability, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the solution.
