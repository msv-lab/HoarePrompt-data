Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
2
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4 1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {0, 1} is 2. Setting both elements to 2 results in the array [2, 2] with a sum of 4.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3
1 3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
13 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial sum is already 13, and no operation can increase it.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
**Explanation**: First, set the third element to 0, then set elements 3 and 4 to 2, resulting in the array [1, 100, 2, 2] with a sum of 105.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {0} is 1. Setting the single element to 1 results in the array [1] with a sum of 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0 1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {1} is 0. Setting the single element to 0 results in the array [0] with a sum of 0.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {1, 1} is 0. Setting both elements to 0 results in the array [0, 0] with a sum of 0. However, setting both elements to 1 (MEX of {1, 1} is 0, but we can set to 1 to maximize sum) results in the array [1, 1] with a sum of 2.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3 1
1 3
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {0, 0, 0} is 1. Setting all elements to 1 results in the array [1, 1, 1] with a sum of 3.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
3
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3 1
1 3
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {2, 2, 2} is 0. Setting all elements to 0 results in the array [0, 0, 0] with a sum of 0. However, setting all elements to 1 (MEX of {2, 2, 2} is 0, but we can set to 1 to maximize sum) results in the array [1, 1, 1] with a sum of 3.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
4
0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
4 1
1 4
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {0, 0, 0, 0} is 1. Setting all elements to 1 results in the array [1, 1, 1, 1] with a sum of 4.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
4
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
10 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial sum is already 10, and no operation can increase it.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
15 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial sum is already 15, and no operation can increase it.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5 1
1 5
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {5, 5, 5, 5, 5} is 0. Setting all elements to 0 results in the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] with a sum of 0. However, setting all elements to 1 (MEX of {5, 5, 5, 5, 5} is 0, but we can set to 1 to maximize sum) results in the array [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] with a sum of 5.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
18
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
```
**Output**: 
```
171 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial sum is already 171, and no operation can increase it.

**Explanation**: The MEX of {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1} is 0. Setting all elements to 0 results in the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] with a sum of 0. However, setting all elements to 1 (MEX of {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1} is 0, but we can set to 1 to maximize sum) results in the array [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] with a sum of 18.
