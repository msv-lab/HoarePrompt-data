# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array has only one element, so no operation is needed.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to choose i=1, j=1, x=2, resulting in the array [2, 2] with a cost of 1 burle.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to choose i=1, j=2, x=3, resulting in the array [3, 3, 3] with a cost of 2 burles.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
7
4 3 2 7 1 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to choose i=1, j=7, x=1, resulting in the array [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] with a cost of 7 burles, but choosing i=1, j=6, x=1 and i=7, j=7, x=1 results in a cost of 6 burles.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
9
9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to choose i=3, j=9, x=9, resulting in the array [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9] with a cost of 7 burles.

# Test 9 (Large Array)
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
199999
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to choose i=1, j=199999, x=200000, resulting in the array [200000, 200000, ..., 200000, 1] with a cost of 199999 burles.

# Test 10 (All Elements Same Except One)
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to choose i=5, j=5, x=1, resulting in the array [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] with a cost of 1 burle.

# Test 11 (Alternating Elements)
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 2 1 2 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to choose i=1, j=3, x=1 and i=4, j=6, x=1, resulting in the array [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] with a cost of 3 burles.

# Test 12 (All Elements Different)
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to choose i=1, j=4, x=5, resulting in the array [5, 5, 5, 5, 5] with a cost of 4 burles.

# Test 13 (Multiple Test Cases)
**Input**: 
```
3
3
1 1 1
4
1 2 3 4
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
3
4
```
**Explanation**: The first test case has a uniform array, the second and third test cases require operations to make the array uniform with costs 3 and 4 burles, respectively.

# Test 14 (Single Element Repeated)
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already uniform, so no operation is needed.

**Input**: 
```
1
5
3 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
