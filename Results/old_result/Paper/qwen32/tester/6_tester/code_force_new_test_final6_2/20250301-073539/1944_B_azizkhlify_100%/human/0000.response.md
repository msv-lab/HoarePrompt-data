Sure, let's create comprehensive test cases for the given problem. We'll cover basic scenarios to ensure the function works under normal conditions and edge scenarios to test the robustness and reliability of the solution.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 2 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2
1 2
```
**Explanation**: The simplest case where n=2 and k=1. Both halves of the array are identical, so any subset of length 2 from each half will satisfy the condition.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2
1 2
```
**Explanation**: Another simple case where n=4 and k=1. Both halves of the array contain the same elements, so we can choose any subset of length 2 from each half.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2
```
**Output**: 
```
5 1 3 3
6 4 2 4
```
**Explanation**: A case where n=6 and k=2. We need to find two subsets of length 4 from each half such that their XORs are equal. The provided output is one valid solution.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 1
6 4 2 1 2 3 1 6 3 5 5 4
```
**Output**: 
```
6 4
1 3
```
**Explanation**: A case where n=6 and k=1. We need to find two subsets of length 2 from each half such that their XORs are equal. The provided output is one valid solution.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
1 1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
2 2
```
**Explanation**: Edge case where n=2 and k=2, meaning we need to use all elements in each half. The XOR of [1, 1] is 0, and the XOR of [2, 2] is also 0, satisfying the condition.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 2 2
3 3 4 4
```
**Explanation**: Edge case where n=4 and k=2, meaning we need to use all elements in each half. The XOR of [1, 1, 2, 2] is 0, and the XOR of [3, 3, 4, 4] is also 0, satisfying the condition.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10 5
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10
```
**Explanation**: Edge case where n=10 and k=5, meaning we need to use all elements in each half. The XOR of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is the same as the XOR of [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], satisfying the condition.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
```
**Explanation**: Edge case where n=6 and k=3, meaning we need to use all elements in each half. The XOR of [1, 2, 3] is the same as the XOR of [4, 5, 6], satisfying the condition.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
6 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2
6 5
```
**Explanation**: Edge case where n=6 and k=1, and the second half is a reverse of the first half. The XOR of [1, 2] is the same as the XOR of [6, 5], satisfying the condition.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
8 4
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4
8 7 6 5
```
**Explanation**: Edge case where n=8 and k=4, and the second half is a reverse of the first half. The XOR of [1, 2, 3, 4] is the same as the XOR of [8, 7, 6, 5], satisfying the condition.

These test cases should cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust, reliable, and scalable.
