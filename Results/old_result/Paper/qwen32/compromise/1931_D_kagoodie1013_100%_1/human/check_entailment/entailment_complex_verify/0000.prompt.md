You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

    return results
    #The program returns `results` which contains the final value of `count` for each test case in `test_cases`. Each `count` represents the total number of times a pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been encountered before for each element in `arr` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the number of times a specific pair of residues `(r_x, r_y)` has been encountered before for each element in the list `a`. The result for each test case is stored in a list `results`, which is returned at the end. The input `test_cases` remains unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array according to the problem description. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the array `arr`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes a count of beautiful pairs to zero.
   - It uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)` where `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.
   - For each number in the array, it calculates `r_x` and `r_y`.
   - It increments the count by the number of times the pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been seen before (using the dictionary).
   - It updates the dictionary to include the current number's residue pair.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the counts of beautiful pairs for each test case.

The logic of updating the residue map and counting pairs based on the residues ensures that the program correctly identifies pairs `(i, j)` where `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

The code handles the constraints and edge cases well:
- It uses efficient dictionary operations to keep track of residue pairs, ensuring that the solution runs within the required time limits.
- It correctly handles the modulo operations and negative values by using `-num % x` to ensure the residue is positive.

The provided example cases are correctly handled by the program, and there are no obvious edge cases that the program would fail to handle based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
