### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem by leveraging the concept of residue classes modulo `x` and `y`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the input and parses it into a list of test cases. Each test case consists of integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `a` of `n` integers.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes a `count` to zero and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the frequency of each pair `(num % x, num % y)` encountered in the array `a`.
   
3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - For each element `num` in the array:
     - It calculates `r_x` as `-num % x` and `r_y` as `num % y`.
     - It then checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been encountered before by looking it up in `residue_map`. If it has, it adds the frequency of this pair to `count`.
     - It updates `residue_map` to include the current element's pair `(num % x, num % y)`.
   
4. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements in the array for a test case, the program appends the `count` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Analysis:

The logic for counting beautiful pairs is based on the mathematical properties of modular arithmetic. Specifically, for a pair of indices `<i, j>` to be beautiful:
- `a_i + a_j` must be divisible by `x`, which implies `(a_i % x) + (a_j % x) ≡ 0 (mod x)`, or equivalently, `a_j % x ≡ -a_i % x (mod x)`.
- `a_i - a_j` must be divisible by `y`, which implies `(a_i % y) - (a_j % y) ≡ 0 (mod y)`, or equivalently, `a_j % y ≡ a_i % y (mod y)`.

The program correctly implements these conditions by calculating `r_x` as `-num % x` and `r_y` as `num % y` and checking if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been seen before. If it has, it means there exists a previous element that can form a beautiful pair with the current element.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
