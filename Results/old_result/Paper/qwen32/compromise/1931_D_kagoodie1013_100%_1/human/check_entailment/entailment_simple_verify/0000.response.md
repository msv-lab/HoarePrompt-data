### Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the program, let's analyze the logic and the annotations provided, focusing on whether the program correctly identifies beautiful pairs according to the problem description.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. A pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if:
   - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
   - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads input efficiently by reading all input at once and parsing it.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes a count of beautiful pairs to zero.
   - It uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of pairs of residues \((r_x, r_y)\) where:
     - \(r_x = -num \% x\)
     - \(r_y = num \% y\)
   - For each number in the array, it calculates `r_x` and `r_y`.
   - It increments the count by the number of times the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) has been seen before (using the dictionary).
   - It updates the dictionary to include the current number's residue pair.

#### Verification Using Annotations:
- **State Before Function Call:** The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before the function call, with `test_cases` being a list of tuples containing the parameters for each test case.
- **State After Processing Each Test Case:** The annotations correctly describe the state after processing each test case. The `residue_map` is re-initialized for each test case and contains the frequency of each \((num \% x, num \% y)\) pair encountered in `arr` for that specific test case.

#### Critical Evaluation:
1. **Correctness of Residue Calculation:**
   - The program calculates \(r_x = -num \% x\) and \(r_y = num \% y\).
   - This ensures that the residues are correctly computed and positive.
   - The logic for checking beautiful pairs is based on the fact that:
     - \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) implies \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\), hence \(r_x = -a_i \% x\) should match \(a_j \% x\).
     - \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) implies \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\), hence \(r_y = a_i \% y\) should match \(a_j \% y\).

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - The program correctly counts the number of times a pair \((r_x, r_y)\) has been seen before.
   - This ensures that for each number in the array, it counts the number of previous numbers that form a beautiful pair with it.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles large inputs efficiently using dictionary operations.
   - It correctly handles cases where `x` and `y` are equal or different.
   - The program also correctly handles cases where the array contains repeated elements.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array according to the problem description. The annotations confirm that the program's state and behavior are as expected, and the logic for counting beautiful pairs is sound.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
