### Reasoning:
The program is attempting to solve the problem by using a hashmap (dictionary in Python) to keep track of the residues of each element in the array `a` when divided by `x` and `y`. Specifically, for each element `num` in the array, it calculates the residues `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`. The pair `(r_x, r_y)` is then used as a key in the hashmap `residue_map` to count how many times such a pair has been seen before. If the pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been seen before, it means there are previous elements in the array that can form a beautiful pair with the current element `num`. The count of such pairs is accumulated and returned for each test case.

The logic behind this approach is based on the mathematical properties of residues:
- For a pair `(i, j)` to be beautiful, both `a_i + a_j` and `a_i - a_j` must be divisible by `x` and `y` respectively.
- This translates to the conditions:
  - `(a_i % x) + (a_j % x) == 0` (or equivalently, `a_i % x == -a_j % x`)
  - `(a_i % y) - (a_j % y) == 0` (or equivalently, `a_i % y == a_j % y`)

By iterating through the array and using a hashmap to keep track of the residues, the program efficiently counts the number of beautiful pairs without having to check every possible pair explicitly, which would be computationally expensive.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described above and should produce the correct results based on the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
