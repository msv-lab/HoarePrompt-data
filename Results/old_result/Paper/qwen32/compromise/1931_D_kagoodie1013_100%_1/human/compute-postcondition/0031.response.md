Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` is a non-empty list, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `arr` is the non-empty list from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns a tuple `(num % x, num % y)` to the variable `current_key`. No other variables are changed, so the rest of the initial state remains the same.
