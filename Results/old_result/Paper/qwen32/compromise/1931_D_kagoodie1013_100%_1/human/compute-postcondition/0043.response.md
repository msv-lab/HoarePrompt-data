The code snippet updates the `current_key` variable to a tuple containing the current `num` modulo `x` and `num` modulo `y`. This means the `current_key` is recalculated based on the current `num` from the list `arr` and the values of `x` and `y`.

Since the code does not change the values of `x`, `y`, `arr`, `num`, `residue_map`, `count`, or `results`, these variables retain their previous values. The only change is to `current_key`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` is a non-empty list, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is `count + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` mapped to 1 if it was not previously present, or incremented by 1 if it was, `arr` is the non-empty list from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, and `residue_map[current_key]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in `arr`. `current_key` is updated to `(num % x, num % y)`**.
