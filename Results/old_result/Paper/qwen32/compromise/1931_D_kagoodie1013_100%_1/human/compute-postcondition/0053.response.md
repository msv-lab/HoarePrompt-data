Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` has at least one element, `arr` is a list with at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `count` is `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`.**

In natural language: The value of `count` is updated to the value retrieved from `residue_map` for the key `(r_x, r_y)`, which defaults to 0 if the key does not exist. All other variables retain their initial values or definitions.
