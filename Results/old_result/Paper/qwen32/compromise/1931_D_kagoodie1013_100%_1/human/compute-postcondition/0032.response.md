The code updates the `residue_map` dictionary by incrementing the count of the `current_key` by 1. The `current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)`. Since `residue_map` is initially empty, if `current_key` does not exist in `residue_map`, it will be added with a value of 1. If `current_key` already exists, its value will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` is a non-empty list, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` mapped to 1 if it was not previously present, or incremented by 1 if it was, `arr` is the non-empty list from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`**.
