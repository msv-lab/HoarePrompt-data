Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. Each test case is a tuple containing a tuple (n, x, y) and a list a. Here, n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), x and y are integers (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9), and a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The length of the `test_cases` list is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    count = 0
    residue_map = {}
    for num in arr:
        r_x = -num % x
        r_y = num % y
        count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
        current_key = num % x, num % y
        residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is the total number of times a `(r_x, r_y)` pair has been seen before for each element in `arr`; `residue_map` is a dictionary with keys `(num % x, num % y)` mapped to their respective counts; `arr` is the list from the first tuple in `test_cases`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `count` is the total number of times pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)` have been encountered, `residue_map` is a dictionary with keys as `(num % x, num % y)` and values as their respective frequencies, `arr` is the non-empty list from the next tuple in `test_cases`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` remains unchanged, `results` contains the final value of `count` and the newly appended `count`, `count` is the total number of times a pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been encountered before for each element in `arr`, `residue_map` contains the frequency of each `(num % x, num % y)` pair encountered in `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
