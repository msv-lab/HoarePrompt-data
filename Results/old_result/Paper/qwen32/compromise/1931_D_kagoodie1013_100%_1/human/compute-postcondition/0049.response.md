The code snippet `residue_map = {}` resets the `residue_map` dictionary to an empty dictionary. All other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are taken from the next tuple in `test_cases`.**
