The code snippet provided updates the value of `r_y` by recalculating it as `num % y`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `num` is the third element in `arr` and `y` is part of the tuple in `test_cases`, the new value of `r_y` is specifically `num % y`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 1; `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(n % x, n % y)` mapped to 2; `arr` is the list from the first tuple in `test_cases`; `r_x` is `-num % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`; `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`; `num` is the third element in `arr`.**
