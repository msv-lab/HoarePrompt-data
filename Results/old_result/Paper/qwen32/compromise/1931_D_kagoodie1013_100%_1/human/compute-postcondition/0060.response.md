The code snippet updates the value of `current_key` to be a tuple of the form `(num % x, num % y)`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the given initial state.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`, `arr` has at least one element, `num` is the next element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `count` is `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` plus the previous value of `count`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` as the key and its value is 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`**.

In natural language, the `current_key` is now updated to the tuple `(num % x, num % y)`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
