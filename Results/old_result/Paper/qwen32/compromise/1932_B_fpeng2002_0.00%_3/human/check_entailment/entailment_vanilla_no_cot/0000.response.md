Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given Python program does not correctly calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The issue lies in the formula used to calculate the `start_year` for each sign.

The current formula `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is incorrect because it does not properly account for the next occurrence of the sign after the current `start_year`. 

To correctly determine the year in which each sign occurs, we should find the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`. This can be done using the formula:

```python
start_year = ((start_year // nums[x]) + 1) * nums[x]
```

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year // nums[x]) + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)
```

This corrected version ensures that for each sign, we find the next occurrence after the current `start_year`, which aligns with the problem statement.
