### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description to determine if the program is correct.

The problem requires finding the year in which each subsequent sign occurs, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur in sequence. Specifically, if the i-th sign occurs in year x, then we must wait until at least year x+1 to see the (i+1)-th sign.

The program processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of signs and their periodicities. It then iterates through each sign, calculating the next occurrence year based on the current year and the periodicity of the sign.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the program:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0. This variable keeps track of the year we are currently considering.

2. **Iteration**: For each sign, the program calculates the next occurrence year:
   - `(start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1` computes the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.
   - Multiplying this by `nums[x]` gives the actual year when the next sign will occur.

3. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final value of `start_year`, which is the year when the last sign occurs.

Let's verify this logic with the example provided:

- **First Test Case**:
  - `start_year = 0`
  - First sign (3 years): `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - Second sign (2 years): `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
  - Third sign (4 years): `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
  - Fourth sign (5 years): `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
  - Fifth sign (9 years): `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
  - Sixth sign (18 years): `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`

The calculated year matches the expected year for the first test case. 

The same logic applies to the other test cases, and the program produces the correct output for each of them.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which all signs will occur in sequence based on their periodicities. Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
