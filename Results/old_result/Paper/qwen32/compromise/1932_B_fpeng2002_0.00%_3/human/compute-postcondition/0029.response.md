The code snippet `n = int(input())` will overwrite the previous value of `n` with a new integer value provided by the user input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num_tests` is at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element, `start_year` is the result of the nested calculation described above, and `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.**
