The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_tests` is an integer representing the number of test cases, which implies it has been decremented by 1 during the loop body execution.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to adjust `num_tests` to be at least 1.

State: **`num_tests` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers, and `start_year` is the final value after applying the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element in `nums`.**
