The code modifies the `start_year` variable based on the current value of `start_year`, the element at index `x` in the `nums` list, and the integer division and modulo operations. Here's the detailed calculation:

1. `start_year` is initially 0.
2. The expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is evaluated:
   - `start_year + 1` is `1`.
   - `1 // nums[x]` performs integer division of `1` by the element at index `x` in `nums`. Since `nums[x]` is an integer and `nums` has at least one element, this division results in `0` if `nums[x]` is greater than `1` and `1` if `nums[x]` is `1`.
   - Adding `1` to the result of the integer division shifts the result to `1` if `nums[x]` is greater than `1` and `2` if `nums[x]` is `1`.
   - Multiplying this result by `nums[x]` gives `nums[x]` if `nums[x]` is greater than `1` and `2 * nums[x]` if `nums[x]` is `1`.

Therefore, the new value of `start_year` is `nums[x]` if `nums[x]` is greater than `1`, and `2 * nums[x]` if `nums[x]` is `1`.

Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is `nums[x]` if `nums[x]` is greater than 1, and `start_year` is `2 * nums[x]` if `nums[x]` is 1.**
