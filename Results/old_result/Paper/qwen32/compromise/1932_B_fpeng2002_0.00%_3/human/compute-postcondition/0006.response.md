To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `len(nums)`. According to the for loop statement:

```python
for x in range(0, len(nums)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `len(nums)` is greater than 0. The variable `x` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, so we don't need to explicitly set it before the loop.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **`nums`**: The loop will execute if `nums` has at least one element. Therefore, `nums` must be a list with at least one integer.
2. **`x`**: This variable is controlled by the `range` function and will be set to 0 at the start of the loop, so we don't need to adjust it.

Given the initial state: `num_tests` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers, and `start_year` is 0, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `nums` has at least one element.

State: **`num_tests` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is 0**
