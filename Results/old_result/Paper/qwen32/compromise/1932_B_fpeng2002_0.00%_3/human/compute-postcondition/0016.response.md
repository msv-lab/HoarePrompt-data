Output State: **`num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers, and `start_year` is the final value after applying the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element in `nums`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer, while the values of `num_tests`, `nums`, and `start_year` remain unchanged.
