Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num_tests` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 1000.
Code of the loop:
while num_tests > 0:
    num_tests -= 1
    n = int(input())
    nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    start_year = 0
    for x in range(0, len(nums)):
        start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
    print(start_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `num_tests` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers, and `start_year` is the final value after applying the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element in `nums`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element, `start_year` is the result of the nested calculation described above, and `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `num_tests` is at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `start_year` is the result of the nested calculations involving all elements in `nums`, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
