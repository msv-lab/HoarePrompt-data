The value of `num_tests` is decremented by 1. Given the initial state where `num_tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000, after the code execution, `num_tests` will be an integer between 0 and 999. The other precondition remains valid.

Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 0 â‰¤ `num_tests` â‰¤ 999**.
