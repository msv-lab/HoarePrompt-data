The code snippet provided updates the `nums` list by reading a new set of integers from the input. The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `start_year`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num_tests` is at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `start_year` is the result of the nested calculation described above, and `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.**

In simpler terms, `nums` is now a new list of integers based on the input, while the other variables retain their previous values.
