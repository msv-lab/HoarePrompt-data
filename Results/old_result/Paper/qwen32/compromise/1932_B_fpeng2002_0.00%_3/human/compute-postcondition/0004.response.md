The code reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `nums`. The variables `num_tests` and `n` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 0 â‰¤ `num_tests` â‰¤ 999; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers.**
