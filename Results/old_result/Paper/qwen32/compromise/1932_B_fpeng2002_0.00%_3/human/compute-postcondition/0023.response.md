The only variables in the loop head are `x` and the range it iterates over, which is `len(nums)`. Therefore, we need to adjust `x` for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element
- `start_year` is `(((0 + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x] + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`
- `x` is `x + 1`

At the end of the last iteration, `x` was incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be incremented by 1 once more, and it must still be less than `len(nums)`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `x` should be `x + 1` (from the previous state where `x` was already incremented by 1, this means we need to increment it again to reflect the start of the new iteration).

State: **`num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element, `start_year` is `(((0 + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x] + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, `x` is `x + 2`**
