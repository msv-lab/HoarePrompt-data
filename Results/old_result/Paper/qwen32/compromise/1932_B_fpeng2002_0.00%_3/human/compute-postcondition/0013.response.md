To determine what will be printed by the `print(start_year)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the formula applied to `start_year`.

### Initial State Recap:
- `num_tests` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers.
- `start_year` is the final value after applying the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element in `nums`.

### Formula Analysis:
The formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is applied iteratively for each element `nums[x]` in the list `nums`.

Let's break down the formula:
1. `(start_year + 1)`: Adds 1 to the current `start_year`.
2. `// nums[x]`: Performs integer division by the current element `nums[x]` in the list.
3. `+ 1`: Adds 1 to the result of the integer division.
4. `* nums[x]`: Multiplies the result by `nums[x]`.

The formula essentially rounds up `start_year + 1` to the nearest multiple of `nums[x]`.

### Iterative Application:
The formula is applied for each element in `nums`, meaning `start_year` is updated iteratively as follows:
- For the first element `nums[0]`, `start_year` is updated to the nearest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`.
- For the second element `nums[1]`, the updated `start_year` is then used to compute the next nearest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to the updated `start_year + 1`.
- This process continues for all elements in `nums`.

### Final Output:
The final value of `start_year` after all iterations is what will be printed by the `print(start_year)` statement.

### Conclusion:
Given the iterative nature of the formula and the lack of an initial value for `start_year` in the problem statement, we can only describe the final `start_year` as the result of the iterative application of the formula on the list `nums`.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the final value after applying the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` iteratively for each element in the list `nums`)**
