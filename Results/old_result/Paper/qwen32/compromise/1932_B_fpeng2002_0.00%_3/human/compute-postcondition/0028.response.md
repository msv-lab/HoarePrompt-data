The value of `num_tests` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `nums`, `start_year`, and `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `num_tests` is at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element, `start_year` is the result of the nested calculation described above, and `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.

Output State: **`num_tests` is at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element, `start_year` is the result of the nested calculation described above, and `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.**
