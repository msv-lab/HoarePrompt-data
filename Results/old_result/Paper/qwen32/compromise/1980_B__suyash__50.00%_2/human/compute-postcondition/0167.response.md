The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `l`. Since the loop iterates over the indices of the list `l`, we need to adjust `i` to ensure the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The list `l` does not need to be adjusted as it remains the same throughout the loop iterations.

State: **`l` is a list with at least one unique element, `i` is 2**
