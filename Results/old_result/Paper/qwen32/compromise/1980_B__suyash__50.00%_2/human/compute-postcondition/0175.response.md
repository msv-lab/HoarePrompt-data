Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `l` is a list with at least one unique element.
- `i` is set to the value 2.
- `k` is decreased by `dic[l[2]]`. Note that `dic` is a dictionary, but it is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, the value of `k` after this operation is not used in the `print` statement.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward. It prints the string `'YES'`. None of the variables `l`, `i`, or `k` (or `dic`) are used within the `print` statement itself. Therefore, the value of these variables does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The code will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
