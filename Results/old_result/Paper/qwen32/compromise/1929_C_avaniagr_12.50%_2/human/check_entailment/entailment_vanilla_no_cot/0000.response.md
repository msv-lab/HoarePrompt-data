Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins based on the given rules and conditions. Here's a detailed analysis of the issues:

1. **Logic for `x < k - 1`**: The program checks if `a >= x + 1` and prints "YES" if true, otherwise "NO". This is incorrect. The logic should consider how Sasha can recover from consecutive losses and whether the initial amount of coins `a` is sufficient to ensure that he can continue betting after some losses.

2. **Logic for `x == k - 1`**: The program checks if `a >= x + 3` and prints "YES" if true, otherwise "NO". This is also incorrect. The condition `a >= x + 3` does not accurately reflect the necessary condition for Sasha to guarantee winning any number of coins.

3. **Logic for `x > k - 1`**: The program calculates `z` iteratively, but the logic is flawed. The calculation does not correctly simulate the process of betting and recovering from losses. The formula used to calculate `z` does not accurately represent the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to ensure he can continue betting indefinitely without running out of coins.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:

- If `x >= k - 1`, Sasha can always recover from any number of consecutive losses because he can bet smaller amounts after losses to ensure he has enough coins to continue.
- If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can only recover from a limited number of consecutive losses. The initial amount of coins `a` must be sufficient to ensure he can continue betting even after the maximum allowed consecutive losses.

A correct approach would involve calculating the minimum initial amount of coins `a` required to ensure Sasha can continue betting indefinitely, considering the maximum number of consecutive losses `x` and the multiplier `k`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        if x >= k - 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            # Calculate the minimum required initial amount of coins
            required = 0
            for i in range(x):
                required = required * k + 1
            if a >= required:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version properly handles the conditions and ensures Sasha can achieve any number of coins based on the given rules.
