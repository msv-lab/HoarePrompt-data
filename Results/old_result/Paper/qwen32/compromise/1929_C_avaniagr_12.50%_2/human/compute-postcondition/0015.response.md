Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` must be greater than 0.
2. `k` is the first integer from the input.
3. `x` is the second integer from the input.
4. `a` is the third integer from the input.
5. `x` is explicitly set to `k - 1`.
6. `a` is less than `x + 3`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are provided in the initial state, but they do not influence the print statement directly. The print statement does not depend on these variables; it only outputs a fixed string.

### Output:
The code will print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
