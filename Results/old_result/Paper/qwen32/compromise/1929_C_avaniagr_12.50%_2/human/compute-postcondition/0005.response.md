The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `k`, `x`, `a`) and their relationships, but these variables are not used within the `print` statement. 

Since the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, or `a`, the output will simply be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
