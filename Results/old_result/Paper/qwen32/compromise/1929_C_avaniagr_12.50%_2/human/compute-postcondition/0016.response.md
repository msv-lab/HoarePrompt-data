Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and is equal to `k - 1`, `a` is the third integer from the input. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 3`.**
