Postcondition: **`k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` are integers as read from the input, with `t` greater than 0. If `x == k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` are preserved. If `x == k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 3`, the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` are also preserved. If `x != k - 1`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` remain unchanged. Additionally, if `x != k - 1` and `k > 2`, `z` is set to `x + 1`; if `x != k - 1` and `k = 2`, `z` is set to `2^(x + 1) - 1`. If `x != k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `z`; otherwise, `a` is less than `z`.**
