The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the expression `x + 1`. If `i` is less than `x + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have taken the value of `x` (since the loop iterates from 0 to `x` inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` should be `x + 1`. However, since the loop condition checks if `i` is less than `x + 1`, `i` should be set to the value it had at the start of the last iteration, which is `x`, to allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0, `a` is the third integer from the input, `z` is 1, `i` is `x`**
