Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0, `a` is the third integer from the input, `z` is `1 + 1 + 1 // (k - 1)`, `i` is `x`**

In simple terms, the value of `z` is updated to `2 + 1 // (k - 1)`, while the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
