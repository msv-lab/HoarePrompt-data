### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The logic behind the program involves identifying the smallest contiguous segment of identical elements within the array. If the smallest segment is either the entire array or if the array is already uniform, the program correctly returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the length of the smallest segment.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `ar`.

2. **Finding the Smallest Segment**:
   - The program initializes `same` to 1 and `num` to the first element of the array.
   - It then iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements that are the same.
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates `minn` with the minimum value between the current `minn` and the length of the segment (`same`).
   - It resets `same` to 1 and updates `num` to the new element.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, the program updates `minn` one last time to account for the final segment.
   - It then checks if `minn` is either `inf` (which should not happen given the logic) or if `minn` equals the length of the array (`len(ar)`). If either condition is true, it prints -1.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

#### Validation with Annotated Code:

- **State Analysis**:
  - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at various points.
  - The program correctly identifies the smallest segment of consecutive identical elements.
  - The final check ensures that if the smallest segment is the entire array, it returns -1.

#### Edge Cases:

- **Single Element Array**:
  - The program correctly returns -1 since a single-element array is already uniform and cannot be made non-beautiful.

- **All Elements Same**:
  - The program correctly returns -1 since all elements are identical, and no segment can be removed to break the beauty.

- **Alternating Elements**:
  - The program correctly identifies the smallest segment that can be removed to break the beauty.

- **Multiple Segments**:
  - The program correctly identifies the smallest segment that can be removed to break the beauty.

#### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make a beautiful array stop being beautiful. It handles all edge cases appropriately and returns the correct results based on the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
