### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summary provided.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be transformed into an array of identical elements by repeatedly replacing an element `a[i]` with `a[i-1]` if `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`. If it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements, the answer should be `-1`.

#### Function Summary Recap:
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive equal elements in the list `a`. If all elements in the list are the same or if there is only one element, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the determined minimum length for each test case.

#### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `same` is initialized to 1 to count the length of the current sequence of identical elements.
   - `num` is set to the first element of the array.
   - `minn` is set to infinity to track the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - The loop iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element is different from `num`, it updates `minn` with the minimum value between `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration.

3. **Final update**:
   - After the loop, `minn` is updated one last time with the minimum value between `minn` and `same`.

4. **Determine the result**:
   - If `minn` is still infinity (which shouldn't happen as it's initialized to `same` at least once) or if `minn` is equal to the length of the array (meaning all elements are the same), the program outputs `-1` because it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful.
   - Otherwise, it outputs `minn`, which represents the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

#### Potential Issues:
- The logic to find the minimum sequence length seems correct as it keeps track of the length of each sequence of identical elements and updates the minimum length.
- However, the program does not correctly handle cases where the array has multiple sequences of identical elements. For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program will incorrectly output `1` instead of `3` because it only considers the length of the first sequence it encounters that is not the entire array.

#### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not always provide the correct minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The program only considers the minimum length of sequences of identical elements but does not account for the fact that multiple such sequences might need to be considered to determine the correct minimum number of elements to remove.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not always provide the correct minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
