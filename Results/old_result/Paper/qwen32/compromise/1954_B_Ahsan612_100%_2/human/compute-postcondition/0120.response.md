Output State: **t is 0; for each of the original t test cases, the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive equal elements in the respective list `ar` is printed, or `-1` if all elements are the same or if there is only one element in the list.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. For each test case, the code will have printed either the minimum length of sequences of consecutive equal elements in the list `ar`, or `-1` if all elements in the list are the same or if the list contains only one element. The other variables (`n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `minn`, `i`) will not retain specific values across iterations as they are reinitialized for each test case.
