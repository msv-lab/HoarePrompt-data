The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` will update the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`.

Given the initial state:
- If `i` is 3, `same` is 2, and `minn` is `inf`. After the execution of the code, `minn` will be updated to 2 because `min(inf, 2)` is 2.
- If `i` is 4, `same` is 1, and `minn` is 1. After the execution of the code, `minn` will remain 1 because `min(1, 1)` is 1.

Therefore, the Output State will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer and `n` must be greater than 3; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` with `n > 1`. If `i` is 3, `same` is 2, and `minn` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 4, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[4]`, and `minn` is 1. `num` is `ar[i]`.**
