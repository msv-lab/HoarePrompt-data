The code assigns the first element of the list `ar` to the variable `num`. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, and `same` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[0]`.**
