The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 5, so after the increment, `i` becomes 6. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, and `minn`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer and `n` must be at least 6; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` with `n > 1`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 2, `same` is 3, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is 6, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[4]`, and `minn` is 1.**
