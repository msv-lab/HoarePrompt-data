To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition `i < len(ar)`. 

Here are the variables in the loop head:
- `i`: the current index in the list `ar`
- `ar`: the list of integers
- `len(ar)`: the length of the list `ar`, which is `n`

From the problem statement:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1)
- `ar` is a new list of integers with length greater than 1
- `n` is the length of the new `ar` list
- `i` is either 2 or 3
- If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2; otherwise, `i` is 2, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, and `num` is `ar[2]`

To ensure that the loop can execute again, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Given that `len(ar)` is `n` and `n` is greater than 1, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n`.

Since `i` is either 2 or 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than `i`. Specifically:
- If `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2.
- If `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3.

Given that `n` is the length of `ar` and `ar` has a length greater than 1, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than the current value of `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers with length greater than 1; `n` must be greater than `i`; `i` is either 2 or 3; if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2; otherwise, `i` is 2, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, and `num` is `ar[2]`**
