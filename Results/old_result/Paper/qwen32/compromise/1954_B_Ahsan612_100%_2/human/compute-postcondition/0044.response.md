The code snippet `num = ar[0]` assigns the value of the first element in the list `ar` to the variable `num`. This means the value of `num` changes to `a1`, the first element of the list `ar`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]`; `i` is equal to the length of `ar`; `same` is 1; `num` is `a1`; `minn` is the minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements that are equal encountered during the loop. If `minn` was initially `inf` or equal to the length of `ar`, it retains its value. Otherwise, `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.**
