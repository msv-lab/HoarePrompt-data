To determine what will be printed by the `print(minn)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1).
- `ar` is a new list of integers with length `n`.
- `n` is the length of the new `ar` list.
- `i` is set to `n`.
- `num` is the last unique number in `ar`.
- `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive identical numbers in `ar`.
- `minn` is the minimum of its current value and `same`.
- `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.

### Analysis:
1. **`ar` and `n`**:
   - `ar` is a list of integers, and `n` is the length of this list. The exact values of the integers in `ar` are not specified, but we know its length `n`.

2. **`i`**:
   - `i` is set to `n`, which is the length of the list `ar`.

3. **`num`**:
   - `num` is the last unique number in `ar`. This means it is the last distinct number that appears in the list `ar`.

4. **`same`**:
   - `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive identical numbers in `ar`. This means it counts how many times the last number in `ar` appears consecutively at the end of the list.

5. **`minn`**:
   - `minn` is the minimum value between its current value and `same`. The exact initial value of `minn` is not provided, but it is mentioned that it is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `minn` is the result of taking the minimum between its current value and `same`, the output of `print(minn)` will be the value of `minn` after this comparison.
- The exact numerical value of `minn` cannot be determined without knowing the initial value of `minn` and the value of `same`.
- However, we know that `minn` is at least as small as `same` and is not `inf` or equal to the length of `ar`.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, the most precise description of the output is that it will be the value of `minn` after comparing it with `same`.

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum value between its initial value and the count of the last sequence of consecutive identical numbers in `ar`)**
