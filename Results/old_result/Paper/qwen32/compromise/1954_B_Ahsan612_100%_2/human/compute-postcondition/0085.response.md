The code snippet assigns the value `inf` (infinity) to the variable `minn`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` read from the input; `n` is the length of the new `ar` list; `i`, `minn` are undefined or recalculated based on the new `ar` list; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[0]`; `minn` is `inf`.**
