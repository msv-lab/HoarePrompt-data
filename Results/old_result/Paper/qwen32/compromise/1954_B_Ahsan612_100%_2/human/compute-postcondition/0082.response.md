The code snippet provided reads a new list of integers from the input and assigns it to `ar`. This means the previous values of `ar`, `n`, `i`, `same`, `num`, and `minn` are no longer relevant as they are either recalculated or reassigned based on the new input. The new `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `n` is implicitly the length of this new list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` read from the input; `n` is the length of the new `ar` list; `i`, `same`, `num`, and `minn` are undefined or recalculated based on the new `ar` list.**
