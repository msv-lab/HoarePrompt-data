The code snippet provided initializes a variable `same` to 1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `ar` are not altered by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `same` is 1**.
