The code snippet `num = ar[i]` updates the value of `num` to be the value at index `i` in the list `ar`. Since `i` is either 4, 5, or 6, `num` will now hold the value of `ar[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers with length greater than or equal to 6; `n` must be greater than `i`; `i` is either 4, 5, or 6; `num` is `ar[i]`; `same` is 3 if `ar[i]` was equal to `num` initially, otherwise `same` is 1; `minn` is 1.**
