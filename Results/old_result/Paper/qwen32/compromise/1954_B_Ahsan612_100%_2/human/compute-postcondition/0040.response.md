The loop head in the provided `for` loop is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means the only variable that can be adjusted is the loop variable `_`, which is not explicitly used within the loop body (indicated by `_`). The loop will execute based on the range provided by `int(input())`, which does not directly relate to the variables `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `same`, `num`, or `minn`.

However, since the loop is controlled by the input and not by any of the variables mentioned, the state of the variables `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `same`, `num`, and `minn` does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. The loop will execute based on the number of times specified by the input, regardless of the current state of these variables.

Thus, the state of the variables remains unchanged from the end of the previous iteration to the start of the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers; `i` is equal to the length of `ar`; `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal; `num` is the value of the last element in the list `ar` or the value of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal; `minn` is the minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements that are equal encountered during the loop. If `minn` was initially `inf` or equal to the length of `ar`, it retains its value. Otherwise, `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.**
