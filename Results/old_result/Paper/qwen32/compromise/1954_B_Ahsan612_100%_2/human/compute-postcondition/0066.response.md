Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer and `n` must be at least 6; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` with `n > 1`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 2, `same` is 4, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is 5, `same` is 2, `num` is `ar[4]`, and `minn` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `same` has been incremented by 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` was 3 and is now 4. Otherwise, `same` was 1 and is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
