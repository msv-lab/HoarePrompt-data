Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    same = 1
    num = ar[0]
    minn = inf
    i = 1
    while i < len(ar):
        if ar[i] == num:
            same += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            num = ar[i]
            minn = min(minn, same)
            same = 1
        i += 1
    minn = min(minn, same)
    if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers; `i` is equal to the length of `ar`; `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal; `num` is the value of the last element in the list `ar` or the value of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal; `minn` is the minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements that are equal encountered during the loop. If `minn` was initially `inf` or equal to the length of `ar`, it retains its value. Otherwise, `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]`; `i` is `n`; `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `ar[n-1]` at the end of the list; `num` is `ar[n-1]`; `minn` is the minimum of its original value and `same`. If `minn` is `inf` or `minn` is equal to the length of `ar`, the condition holds as specified in the if part. Otherwise, `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers with length `n`; `n` is the length of the new `ar` list; `i` is `n`; `num` is the last unique number in `ar`; `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive identical numbers in `ar`; `minn` is the minimum of its current value and `same`. Additionally, `minn` is either equal to `inf`, equal to the length of `ar`, or neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
