The code snippet provided assigns the value `1` to the variable `same`. This change affects the value of `same` but does not change the values of other variables. The initial state specifies different conditions based on the value of `i`, but since the code only modifies `same`, the conditions related to `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer and `n` must be greater than 3; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` with `n > 1`. If `i` is 3, `same` is 1, and `minn` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 4, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[4]`, and `minn` is 1. `num` is `ar[i]`.**
