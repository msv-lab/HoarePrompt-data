The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the variable `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value and the value of `same`. 

Given the initial state, the value of `minn` is updated to the smaller of its current value and the value of `same`. The other variables (`t`, `ar`, `n`, `i`, `num`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers with length `n`; `n` is the length of the new `ar` list; `i` is `n`; `num` is the last unique number in `ar`; `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive identical numbers in `ar`; `minn` is the minimum of its current value and `same`.**
