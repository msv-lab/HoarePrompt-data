Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 3; if `ar[3]` equals `num`, then `i` remains 3 and `same` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is updated to 4, `num` is set to `ar[4]`, `minn` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `same`, and `same` is reset to 1; `i` is increased by 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the specific value of `i` depends on its previous state. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, and `same`) remain unchanged unless `i` was 3 and `ar[3]` was equal to `num`, in which case `same` would have been incremented by 1. If `i` was not 3 or `ar[3]` was not equal to `num`, then `i` would have been set to 4, `num` to `ar[4]`, `minn` to the minimum of its previous value and `same`, and `same` reset to 1 before being incremented by 1 in this step.
