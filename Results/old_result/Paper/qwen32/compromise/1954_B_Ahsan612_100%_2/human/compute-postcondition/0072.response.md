The code snippet provided increments the value of the variable `i` by 1. The initial state specifies that `i` can have one of two values: 2 or 6, based on whether `ar[i]` is equal to `num` or not. Since the code only modifies `i`, we need to adjust its value accordingly.

- If `i` was 2, it will become 3.
- If `i` was 6, it will become 7.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, and `minn`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer and `n` must be at least 6; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` with `n > 1`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 3, `same` is 4, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is 7, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[6]`, and `minn` is 1.**
