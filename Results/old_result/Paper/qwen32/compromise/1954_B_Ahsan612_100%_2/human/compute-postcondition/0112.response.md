The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` was initially either 3, 4, or 5, after the increment, `i` will be 4, 5, or 6 respectively. The values of `t`, `ar`, `n`, `num`, `same`, and `minn` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers with length greater than or equal to 6; `n` must be greater than `i`; `i` is either 4, 5, or 6; `num` is `ar[i]` if `i` is 3 or 4, otherwise `ar[2]`; `same` is 4 if `ar[i]` was equal to `num` initially, otherwise `same` is 1; `minn` is 1.**
