### Reasoning:

The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of a square. It then calculates the side length of the square and computes the area by squaring the side length. 

The program uses the property that for a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, two pairs of x-coordinates and two pairs of y-coordinates must be the same. Based on this, the program checks for the pairs of equal x-coordinates and calculates the side length using the difference in the corresponding y-coordinates (or vice versa).

The logic in the program is correct in that it considers all possible configurations of the coordinates of the square's corners and calculates the side length correctly. The area is then correctly calculated by squaring the side length. The program also correctly prints the area for each test case.
