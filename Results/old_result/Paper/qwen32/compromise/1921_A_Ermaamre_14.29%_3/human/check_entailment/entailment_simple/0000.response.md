### Reasoning:
The program is designed to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The key steps in the program are:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates representing the corners of the square.
2. **Logic to Determine Side Length**: The program checks for which pair of x-coordinates are the same to determine the side length of the square. It then calculates the absolute difference in the y-coordinates of the corresponding points to get the side length.
3. **Area Calculation**: Once the side length is determined, it squares this value to get the area of the square and prints the result.

The program handles all possible arrangements of the coordinates (since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes) by checking the x-coordinates of the points. It correctly identifies the side length based on the given conditions and calculates the area.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Coordinates: (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2)
  - The x-coordinates 1 and 4 are repeated, so the side length is the absolute difference in y-coordinates, which is |5 - 2| = 3.
  - Area = 3^2 = 9

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Coordinates: (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)
  - The x-coordinates -1 and 1 are repeated, so the side length is the absolute difference in y-coordinates, which is |1 - (-1)| = 2.
  - Area = 2^2 = 4

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Coordinates: (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39)
  - The x-coordinates 45 and 17 are repeated, so the side length is the absolute difference in y-coordinates, which is |39 - 11| = 28.
  - Area = 28^2 = 784

The program correctly computes the area for each test case as shown in the example.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the area of the square based on the given corner coordinates and handles the test cases as expected.

**Correctness: True**
