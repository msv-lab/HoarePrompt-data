To determine if the given Python program is correct, let's analyze the logic and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a game on an n \times n chessboard where players take turns placing rooks. The key points are:

1. Players place rooks such that no two rooks attack each other (i.e., no two rooks can be in the same row or column).
2. The first player places white rooks, and the second player (the computer) mirrors the move by placing a black rook at the mirrored position (c, r) if r != c.
3. If r == c, the computer skips its turn.
4. After k moves, we need to determine the number of different final configurations possible for the remaining valid moves.

### Program Analysis

The program reads the input and processes each test case as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the size of the board `n` and the number of moves `k` already made.
   - It then reads `k` pairs of integers (r, c) representing the moves made.
   - For each move, it increments a counter `num` by 1 if r == c (computer skips its turn), and by 2 otherwise (both players place rooks).
   - It calculates `m = n - num`, which represents the number of rows/columns left to place rooks.
   - If `m == 0` or `m == 1`, there is only one possible configuration, so it prints 1.
   - For `m > 1`, it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of different final configurations. The DP array `dp` is used where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on `i` rows/columns.

### Dynamic Programming Logic

The DP logic used in the program is as follows:
- `dp[1] = 1`: There's only one way to place a rook in a single row/column.
- `dp[2] = 3`: There are three ways to place rooks in a 2x2 grid (both players can place rooks in different positions or one player can place a rook in the diagonal).
- For `i > 2`, the recurrence relation is:
  - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
  - This relation considers placing a rook in one row/column and then solving the remaining problem in `i-1` rows/columns, as well as placing two rooks in different rows/columns and solving the remaining problem in `i-2` rows/columns.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of different final configurations based on the given problem description and constraints. The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for solving the problem efficiently.
