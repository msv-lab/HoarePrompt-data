You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    3
    
    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6
    
    1000 4
    
    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        num = 0
        for i in range(k):
            (c, r) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        m = n - num
        if m == 0:

            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the size of a grid and an integer `k` representing the number of moves made on the grid. It also receives `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` representing the row and column of each move. The function calculates and prints a result based on the moves made, which is either `1` if the remaining cells after accounting for the moves are `0` or `1`, or a computed value using dynamic programming if there are more than one remaining cells.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations for all potential cases. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the logic for placing rooks and the mirroring mechanism described in the problem statement.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Mirroring Mechanism**: The program correctly identifies when a move is a mirror (i.e., when `r == c`), but it does not correctly account for the implications of this in the subsequent calculations. When `r == c`, the computer skips its turn, and this should be reflected in the logic for determining the number of remaining valid positions.

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**: The dynamic programming transition used in the program is incorrect. The transition `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` does not accurately reflect the number of ways to place the remaining rooks. The transition needs to consider the number of valid positions left and the fact that each position can be filled in two ways (either by a white rook or a black rook, except when `r == c`).

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where `n` is very large or `k` is close to `n`. In such cases, the number of valid configurations can be significantly different from what the current logic suggests.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the number of remaining valid positions after `k` moves and the mirroring mechanism more carefully. The dynamic programming transition should correctly account for the number of ways to place the remaining rooks in the valid positions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        rows = set()
        cols = set()
        for i in range(k):
            (r, c) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            rows.add(r)
            cols.add(c)
        
        remaining_rows = n - len(rows)
        remaining_cols = n - len(cols)
        remaining_diagonal = len([r for r in rows if r in cols])
        
        remaining_positions = remaining_rows * remaining_cols - remaining_diagonal
        
        if remaining_positions == 0:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [0] * (remaining_positions + 1)
            dp[0] = 1
            for i in range(1, remaining_positions + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] * (remaining_positions - i + 1) * 2) % MOD
            print(dp[remaining_positions])

func()
```

This corrected version properly accounts for the remaining valid positions and the mirroring mechanism, ensuring that the number of possible final configurations is calculated correctly for all potential cases.
