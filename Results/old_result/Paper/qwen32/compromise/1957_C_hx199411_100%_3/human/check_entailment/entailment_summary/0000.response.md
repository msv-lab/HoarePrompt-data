### Reasoning:

The program is designed to compute the number of possible final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves, given the constraints of the game. Here's a breakdown of the logic and its correctness based on the provided problem description and execution summary:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It also reads the `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` representing the moves.

2. **Counting Moves and Special Cases:**
   - It maintains a counter `num` to count how many positions are occupied by rooks after `k` moves and their corresponding mirrored moves.
   - If a move is on the diagonal (`r_i == c_i`), it only counts as one position (`num += 1`).
   - Otherwise, it counts as two positions (`num += 2`), one for the player's move and one for the computer's mirrored move.
   - The remaining number of positions on the board after accounting for these moves is `m = n - num`.

3. **Base Cases:**
   - If `m == 0` or `m == 1`, the number of possible configurations is `1`. This is correct because there are no more moves to make, or only one move left, leading to a single configuration.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Remaining Configurations:**
   - For `m > 1`, the program uses a dynamic programming (DP) approach to calculate the number of possible configurations.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to compute the number of configurations for `m` positions. This formula accounts for the fact that for each new position, you can either place a rook in a way that doesn't mirror an existing rook or in a way that mirrors an existing rook, considering the constraints of the game.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is either `1` for `m == 0` or `m == 1`, or the DP result for `m > 1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all specified cases and uses an efficient dynamic programming approach to compute the number of configurations for larger values of `m`. The provided execution summary aligns with the logic of the program, and there are no apparent issues in the code.

**Correctness: True**
