Output State: **`t` is falsy, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[i]` which is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, `i` is `k`, `num` is the sum of increments based on the comparisons of `c` and `r` in each iteration**.

In simple terms: The value of `dp[i]` has been updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
