Output State: **`t` is truthy - 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `dp` is a list where the first 9 elements are [0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937] and the rest are zeros if `m` is at least 8, `i` is `k` if `m` equals 1, otherwise `i` is `m + 1`, and `num` is the sum of increments based on the comparisons of `c` and `r` in each iteration. If `m` equals 0, the function remains in the same state as described. If `m` equals 1, `dp` remains unchanged and `i` is `k`. If `m` is at least 8, `dp` has zeros appended to it starting from the 10th element and `i` is `m + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables (`n`, `k`, `dp`, `i`, `num`, and `m`) remain unchanged as described in the initial state.
