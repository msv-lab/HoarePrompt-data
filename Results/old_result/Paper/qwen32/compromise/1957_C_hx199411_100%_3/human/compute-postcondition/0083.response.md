Postcondition: **`t` is falsy, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `dp` is a list where the first 9 elements are [0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937] and the rest are zeros if `m` is at least 8. If `m` equals 1, the list `dp` remains [0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937], `i` is `k` if `m` equals 1, otherwise `i` is `m + 1`. `m` is either 1 or at least 8, and `num` is the sum of increments based on the comparisons of `c` and `r` in each iteration.**
