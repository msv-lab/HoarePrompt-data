The only variable in the loop head is `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Given that `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, it is already guaranteed that `t` is greater than 0 and the loop can certainly execute one time.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the state of `t`. The state right before the loop is already suitable for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4**
