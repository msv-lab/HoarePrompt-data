The `print` statement in the given code snippet is `print(1)`. This statement explicitly prints the integer `1` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`), but these do not influence the output of the `print(1)` statement.
2. The `print(1)` statement directly outputs the integer `1`.

Based on this understanding, the output of the code is:

Output: **1**
