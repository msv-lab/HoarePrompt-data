Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ `r_i`, `c_i` ≤ `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    num = 0
    for i in range(k):
        c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if c == r:
            num += 1
        else:
            num += 2
    m = n - num
    if m == 0:
        print(1)
    elif m == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
        dp[1] = 1
        dp[2] = 3
        for i in range(3, m + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
        print(dp[m])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t`, `n`, and `k` remain the same. `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the comparisons of `c` and `r` over the `k` iterations. If `m` is 0, `m` remains 0. If `m` is 1, `m` remains 1. If `m` is greater than 1, `m` is set to 8, `dp` is set to `[0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937]`, and `i` is set to 9.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is falsy, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `dp` is a list where the first 9 elements are [0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937] and the rest are zeros if `m` is at least 8, `i` is `k` if `m` equals 1, otherwise `i` is `m + 1`, and `num` is the sum of increments based on the comparisons of `c` and `r` in each iteration. If `m` equals 0, the function remains in the same state as described. If `m` equals 1, `dp` remains unchanged and `i` is `k`. If `m` is at least 8, `dp` has zeros appended to it starting from the 10th element and `i` is `m + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is truthy - 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list where the first 9 elements are [0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937] and the rest are zeros if `m` is at least 8, `i` is updated based on the value of `m` (either `i + k` if `m` equals 1 or `m + 1` otherwise), `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the number of times `c == r` and `c != r` occurred in the `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` equals 0, then the function may return or terminate as specified in the if part. If `m` equals 1, `dp` remains as is with the first 9 elements initialized. Otherwise, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` values computed using the loop formula.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
