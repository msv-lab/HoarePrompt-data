Output State: **`t` is falsy, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is [0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937], `i` is `k`, `num` is the sum of increments based on the comparisons of `c` and `r` in each iteration.**

In this output state, the value of `m` has been updated to be the result of `n - num`. All other variables retain their initial values or states as described in the initial state, except for `m`.
