Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is falsy (not relevant to the print statement).
   - `n` is the first integer from the input (not relevant to the print statement).
   - `k` is the second integer from the input (not relevant to the print statement).
   - `m` is at least 8.
   - `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1`, except:
     - `dp[1]` is 1,
     - `dp[2]` is 3,
     - `dp[3]` is 7,
     - `dp[4]` is 25,
     - `dp[5]` is 81,
     - `dp[6]` is 331,
     - `dp[7]` is 1303,
     - `dp[8]` is 5937.
   - `i` is `m + 1` (not relevant to the print statement).

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(dp[m])`.

Since `m` is at least 8, and the value of `dp[8]` is explicitly given as 5937, the print statement will output the value of `dp[m]` where `m` is 8.

**Output:**
Output: **5937**
