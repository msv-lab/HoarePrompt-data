Postcondition: **`t`, `n`, and `k` remain the same. `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the comparisons of `c` and `r` over the `k` iterations. If `m` is 0, `m` remains 0. If `m` is 1, `m` remains 1. If `m` is greater than 1, `m` is set to 8, `dp` is set to `[0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937]`, and `i` is set to 9.**
