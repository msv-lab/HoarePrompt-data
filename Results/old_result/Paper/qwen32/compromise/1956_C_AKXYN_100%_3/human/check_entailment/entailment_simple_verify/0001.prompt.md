You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where each iteration processes a matrix of size `n` (as specified by the input). For each test case, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`. The variable `res` is calculated as the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, which simplifies to the formula \(\frac{n(4n^2 + 3n - 1)}{6}\). The variable `i` is 0 at the start of each iteration. The loop prints `res` followed by `n << 1` (which is `2 * n`), and then for each `i` from `n` down to 1, it prints two lines: the first line starting with '1' followed by `i` and the numbers from 1 to `n`, and the second line starting with '2' followed by `i` and the numbers from 1 to `n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis
Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in an n x n matrix using type 1 and type 2 operations. The sum of the matrix elements can be maximized by strategically placing the numbers from 1 to n in the matrix. The operations allow us to set a row or a column to any permutation of numbers from 1 to n.

### Solution Explanation
The provided solution follows these steps:

1. **Matrix Initialization**: The matrix is initialized with rows filled with permutations from 1 to n. However, this initialization step is not used later in the code and can be considered unnecessary for the calculation of the maximum sum or the operations.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the matrix elements is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{res} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)
   \]
   This formula is derived from the fact that the maximum sum can be achieved by placing the highest possible numbers in the matrix in a way that each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to n.

3. **Output the Sum and Number of Operations**: The sum and the number of operations (which is 2n) are printed.

4. **Operations Description**: The operations are described in reverse order (from n to 1), setting each row and column to the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].

### Verification
Let's verify if the solution is correct:

- **Sum Calculation**: The formula used to calculate the sum is correct for achieving the maximum possible sum with the given operations. The sum of the first n natural numbers in each row and column, considering the permutations, results in the maximum sum being:
  \[
  \sum_{i=1}^{n} i \times n = n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2}
  \]
  However, the provided formula \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)\) is also correct and results in the same maximum sum.

- **Number of Operations**: The solution uses exactly 2n operations, which is within the allowed limit.

- **Operations Description**: The operations described ensure that each row and column is set to a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, achieving the maximum sum.

### Conclusion
The provided solution correctly calculates the maximum sum and describes the operations to achieve this sum within the allowed limit of 2n operations.
