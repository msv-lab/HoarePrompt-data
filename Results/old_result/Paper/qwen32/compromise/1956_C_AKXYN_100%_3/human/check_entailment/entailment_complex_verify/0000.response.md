### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment:

#### Problem Analysis:
The objective is to maximize the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using type 1 and type 2 operations, where each operation fills a row or column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \). The maximum sum achievable is the sum of the first \( n^2 \) natural numbers, which is \( \frac{n^2 (n^2 + 1)}{2} \).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program does the following:
1. **Matrix Initialization**: Initializes an \( n \times n \) matrix with the first row as \([1, 2, ..., n]\) and repeats this row \( n \) times.
2. **Sum Calculation**: Calculates the sum `res` using the formula \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \cdot (2i + 1)\). This formula does not compute the maximum sum of the matrix.
3. **Operations Output**: Outputs \( 2n \) operations, alternating between filling a row and a column with the permutation \([1, 2, ..., n]\).

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because:
1. **Sum Calculation**: The formula used for `res` is incorrect. The correct formula should be the sum of the first \( n^2 \) natural numbers.
2. **Operations**: The operations do not ensure that the matrix is filled in a way that maximizes the sum.

#### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:
The annotated version confirms that:
- The matrix is initialized with the same permutation for each row.
- The sum `res` is calculated using the formula \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \cdot (2i + 1)\).
- The operations are printed in a loop that iterates from \( n \) to 1, filling rows and columns with the permutation \([1, 2, ..., n]\).

#### Verification:
1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The formula \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \cdot (2i + 1)\) does not simplify to the maximum sum of the matrix.
   - The correct sum should be \(\frac{n^2 (n^2 + 1)}{2}\).

2. **Operations**:
   - The operations output by the program do not ensure that the matrix is filled with all numbers from 1 to \( n \) exactly once in each row and column, which is necessary to achieve the maximum sum.
   - The operations simply repeat the permutation \([1, 2, ..., n]\) in reverse order for rows and columns, which does not maximize the sum.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum and does not generate the correct sequence of operations to achieve this sum.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
