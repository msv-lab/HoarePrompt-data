Let's analyze the given program in the context of the problem.

The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. The operations involve filling rows or columns with permutations of the numbers from 1 to \( n \).

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Matrix Initialization**:
   - The program initializes an \( n \times n \) matrix `mat` where each row is a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \). However, this matrix is not used anywhere in the output generation.

2. **Calculating the Sum**:
   - The sum `res` is calculated using the formula \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i+1) \times (2i+1)\).
   - For \( n = 1 \):
     - Sum \( = 1 \times (2 \times 0 + 1) = 1 \).
   - For \( n = 2 \):
     - Sum \( = 1 \times (2 \times 0 + 1) + 2 \times (2 \times 1 + 1) = 1 + 6 = 7 \).
   - This formula calculates the sum of the series and is correct for the problem's requirements.

3. **Output Generation**:
   - The program prints the calculated sum and \( 2n \) as the number of operations.
   - It then prints \( n \) operations of type 1 (filling rows) and \( n \) operations of type 2 (filling columns) with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

### Correctness Check

- **Sum Calculation**:
  - The sum calculation is correct and matches the maximum possible sum that can be achieved by filling the matrix with the permutations in the described manner.

- **Operations**:
  - The program outputs exactly \( 2n \) operations as required.
  - Each operation correctly fills either a row or a column with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and generates a valid sequence of operations to achieve this sum without exceeding the limit of \( 2n \) operations.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
