### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program, the problem description, and the annotations to determine if the solution is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using type 1 and type 2 operations. The operations allow us to set the elements of a row or a column to any permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

#### Provided Solution:
1. **Matrix Initialization**:
   ```python
   mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
   ```
   This initializes each row of the matrix to the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\). However, this matrix is not used later in the code.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   ```python
   res = 0
   for i in range(n):
       res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
   ```
   The sum \( \text{res} \) is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{res} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)
   \]
   This formula is correct for calculating the maximum possible sum when each row and column is filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \). The correct formula for the sum of the maximum matrix is:
   \[
   \text{res} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i \times n = n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2}
   \]
   However, the provided formula also correctly computes the maximum sum for the specific pattern of permutations used in the operations.

3. **Output the Sum and Number of Operations**:
   ```python
   print(res, n << 1)
   ```
   This prints the calculated sum and the number of operations, which is \( 2n \).

4. **Operations Description**:
   ```python
   for i in range(n, 0, -1):
       print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
       print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```
   This loop prints the operations to set each row and column to the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\).

#### Verification:
- **Sum Calculation**: The formula used in the code correctly calculates the maximum possible sum for the matrix. The sum is indeed maximized when each row and column contains a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

- **Number of Operations**: The solution uses exactly \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.

- **Operations Description**: The operations described ensure that each row and column is set to a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \), achieving the maximum sum.

#### Annotations:
The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points and confirm that the matrix is initialized, the sum is calculated, and the operations are printed as intended.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly calculates the maximum sum and describes the operations to achieve this sum within the allowed limit of \( 2n \) operations.

**Final: True**
