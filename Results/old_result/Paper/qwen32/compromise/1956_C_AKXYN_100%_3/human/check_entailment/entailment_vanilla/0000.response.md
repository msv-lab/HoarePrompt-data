Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis
Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in an n x n matrix using type 1 and type 2 operations. The sum of the matrix elements can be maximized by strategically placing the numbers from 1 to n in the matrix. The operations allow us to set a row or a column to any permutation of numbers from 1 to n.

### Solution Explanation
The provided solution follows these steps:

1. **Matrix Initialization**: The matrix is initialized with rows filled with permutations from 1 to n. However, this initialization step is not used later in the code and can be considered unnecessary for the calculation of the maximum sum or the operations.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the matrix elements is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{res} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)
   \]
   This formula is derived from the fact that the maximum sum can be achieved by placing the highest possible numbers in the matrix in a way that each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to n.

3. **Output the Sum and Number of Operations**: The sum and the number of operations (which is 2n) are printed.

4. **Operations Description**: The operations are described in reverse order (from n to 1), setting each row and column to the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].

### Verification
Let's verify if the solution is correct:

- **Sum Calculation**: The formula used to calculate the sum is correct for achieving the maximum possible sum with the given operations. The sum of the first n natural numbers in each row and column, considering the permutations, results in the maximum sum being:
  \[
  \sum_{i=1}^{n} i \times n = n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2}
  \]
  However, the provided formula \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)\) is also correct and results in the same maximum sum.

- **Number of Operations**: The solution uses exactly 2n operations, which is within the allowed limit.

- **Operations Description**: The operations described ensure that each row and column is set to a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, achieving the maximum sum.

### Conclusion
The provided solution correctly calculates the maximum sum and describes the operations to achieve this sum within the allowed limit of 2n operations.

Correctness: **True**
