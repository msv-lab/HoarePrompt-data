The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 7, `i` is 2**
