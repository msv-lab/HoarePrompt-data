To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop operates and how the variables change with each iteration.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
    print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

- The loop starts with `i` initialized to `n` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` becomes 0 (but does not include 0 in the loop).
- In each iteration, the loop prints two lines:
  - The first line starts with `'1'`, followed by the current value of `i`, and then the numbers from 1 to `n`.
  - The second line starts with `'2'`, followed by the current value of `i`, and then the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the loop).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`.
- `res` is \(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\).
- `i` is initialized to `n-1` but is immediately overwritten by the loop.

The loop will execute `n` times, with `i` taking values from `n` down to `1`.

After all iterations:
- `i` will be `0` (though it will not be used after the loop ends).
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `mat` remains unchanged.
- `res` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `mat` remains unchanged, `res` remains unchanged, and `i` is `0`.**

In natural language, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `0`, and the values of `n`, `mat`, and `res` will remain the same as they were initially.
