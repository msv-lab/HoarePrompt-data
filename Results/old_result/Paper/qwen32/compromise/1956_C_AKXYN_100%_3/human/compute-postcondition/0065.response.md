To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and its effects on the variables.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
    print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop starts with `i = n` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i = 1`.
- In each iteration, it prints two lines:
  - The first line is: `'1 %d' % i` followed by numbers from 1 to `n`.
  - The second line is: `'2 %d' % i` followed by numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Iteration Count:
- The loop will execute `n` times because `i` starts at `n` and decrements down to 1.

### Initial State:
- `n` is the input integer.
- `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`.
- `res` is \(\frac{n(4n^2 + 3n - 1)}{6}\).
- `i` is initially \(n-1\).

### Output State after All Iterations:
- `i` will be 0 after the loop ends because the loop decrements `i` from `n` to 1, and the next value of `i` after the loop would be 0.
- `n`, `mat`, and `res` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.

### Final Output State:
- `n` remains the same.
- `mat` remains the same.
- `res` remains the same.
- `i` is 0.

Output State: **n is the input integer, mat is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to n, res is \(\frac{n(4n^2 + 3n - 1)}{6}\), i is 0.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be 0, while `n`, `mat`, and `res` will remain unchanged from their initial values.
