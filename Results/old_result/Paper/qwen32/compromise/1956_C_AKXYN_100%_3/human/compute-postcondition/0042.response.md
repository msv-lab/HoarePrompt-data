Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` must be greater than 1.
2. `i` is defined as `n - 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Value of `i`:**
   - Given `i = n - 2`, and knowing `n > 1`, we can determine the value of `i` based on `n`.
   - For example, if `n = 5`, then `i = 5 - 2 = 3`.

2. **String Formatting:**
   - The string `'2 %d' % i` will format the integer value of `i` into the string.
   - Continuing with the example where `n = 5` and `i = 3`, the string would be `'2 3'`.

3. **Range Function:**
   - The `*range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from `1` to `n` inclusive.
   - Using the example where `n = 5`, `range(1, 6)` would generate the sequence `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

4. **Combining the Outputs:**
   - The `print` statement will combine the formatted string with the sequence generated by the `range` function.
   - So, for `n = 5` and `i = 3`, the output would be `'2 3'` followed by the sequence `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

### Generalizing the Output:
Since `n` is any integer greater than 1, we can generalize the output as follows:
- The first part of the output is always `'2 '` followed by the value of `i`, which is `n - 2`.
- The second part of the output is the sequence of numbers from `1` to `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2 [n-2] 1 2 3 ... n (where [n-2] is the value of n-2 and n is any integer greater than 1)**

To make it more precise and match the required format:
Output: **2 %d [1, 2, 3, ..., n] (where %d is the value of n-2 and n is any integer greater than 1)**

However, to match the exact format requested:
Output: **2 [n-2] 1 2 3 ... n (where [n-2] is the value of n-2 and n is any integer greater than 1)**

Simplifying to match the expected format:
Output: **2 %d 1 2 3 ... n (where %d is n-2)**
