Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `i` is defined as \( n - 1 \).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Explanation:
1. **String Formatting**: 
   - `'1 %d' % i` formats the string to include the value of `i`. Since `i` is \( n - 1 \), this part of the string will be `'1 <n-1>'`.
   
2. **Range Function**:
   - `*range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The `*` operator unpacks this sequence so that each number is passed as a separate argument to the `print` function.

### Combining the Parts:
- The `print` function will first output the formatted string `'1 <n-1>'`, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Example Calculation:
If we assume `n` to be 5 (since `n` must be greater than 1, this is a valid example value):
- `i` would be \( 5 - 1 = 4 \).
- The formatted string would be `'1 4'`.
- The range would be `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output: `'1 4'` followed by the numbers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

### Generalized Output:
For any `n > 1`:
- `i` will be `n - 1`.
- The formatted string will be `'1 <n-1>'`.
- The range will be `1, 2, ..., n`.

### Final Output in Required Format:
Output: **1 <n-1> 1 2 3 ... n (where <n-1> is n-1 and the sequence 1 2 3 ... n includes all integers from 1 to n inclusive)**

To make it more precise and adhering to the format:
Output: **1 %d 1 2 3 ... n (where %d is n-1 and the sequence 1 2 3 ... n includes all integers from 1 to n inclusive)**
