Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

**Initial State:**
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is assigned the value of `n`.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is assigned the value of `n`, and `n` is greater than 0, `i` will also be greater than 0 and will have the same value as `n`.

2. **String Formatting:**
   - `'2 %d' % i` is a string formatting operation. `%d` is a placeholder for an integer, and `i` is the integer to be inserted.
   - Therefore, `'2 %d' % i` will be formatted to `'2 n'` where `n` is the value of the variable `i`.

3. **Range Function:**
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` inclusive.
   - This sequence will be unpacked and printed as separate arguments to the `print` function.

**Putting It All Together:**
- The `print` statement will first print the formatted string `'2 n'` where `n` is the value of `i`.
- Then, it will print the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) as separate arguments.

**Example:**
- If `n` (and thus `i`) is 5, the output will be:
  - The formatted string: `'2 5'`
  - The range of numbers: `1 2 3 4 5`

**Final Output:**
Output: **2 n 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of i)**

To be more precise and concrete, let's assume `n` is 5 for the sake of an example:
Output: **2 5 1 2 3 4 5**

However, since `n` is a variable and its exact value is not specified, we should keep the output in terms of `n`:
Output: **2 n 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of i)**
