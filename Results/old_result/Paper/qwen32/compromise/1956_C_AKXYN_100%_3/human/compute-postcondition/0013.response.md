Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state to determine the output:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`.
- `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**:
   - The variable `i` is not defined in the provided initial state.
   - In Python, if a variable is used before it is defined, it will result in a `NameError`.
   - Since there is no definition for `i` in the given context, the code will raise an error if executed as is.
   - However, for the sake of the problem, we will assume `i` is defined somewhere in the code before this print statement, and we need to determine what it could be based on the context.

2. **Expression `'1 %d' % i`**:
   - This is a string formatting operation where the value of `i` will be inserted into the string at the position of `%d`.
   - The output will be `'1 '` followed by the value of `i`.

3. **Expression `*range(1, n + 1)`**:
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence, so it will print each number in the sequence separated by spaces.

### Conclusion:
Given the assumptions and the provided initial state, the output of the print statement will depend on the value of `i`. Since `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can't determine its exact value. However, we can describe the output in terms of `i` and `n`.

### Output:
Output: **1 [i] 1 2 3 ... n (where [i] is the value of i and n is the number of elements in each inner list of mat)**
