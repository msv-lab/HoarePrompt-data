The value of `res` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 2, we can calculate the new value of `res` as follows:

`res += (2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1)`
`res += 3 * 5`
`res += 15`

So, `res` changes from 7 to 22. The values of `n`, `mat`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 22, and `i` is 2**.
