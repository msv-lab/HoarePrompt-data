The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable that does not affect the loop's execution condition. The loop's execution depends on the value of `int(input())`. Since the underscore does not influence the state, we need to consider how the loop will execute based on the input provided to `int(input())`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is greater than the current iteration count. Since this is the start of the first iteration (as `i` was 0 and is not part of the loop head), we need to ensure that `int(input())` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state does not need to change in terms of the variables `t`, `n`, `mat`, `res`, or `i` because they are not part of the loop head. The only condition we need to meet is that the input to the loop must be such that it allows the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is 3, `mat` is a list of 3 lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to 3, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to 2, `i` is 0**
