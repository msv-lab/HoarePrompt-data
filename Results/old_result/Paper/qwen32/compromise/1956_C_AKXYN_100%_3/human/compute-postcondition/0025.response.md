The code snippet sets `res` to 0. This means the previous value of `res` (which was the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to 2) is overwritten. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mat`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 0, `i` is 0**.
