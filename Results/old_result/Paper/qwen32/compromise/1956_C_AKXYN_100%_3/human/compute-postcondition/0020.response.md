To determine the output, let's break down the given information and the print statement step by step.

### Given Information:
1. `t > 0` and `n > 0` (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
2. `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`.
3. `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
4. `i` is explicitly set to 2.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **'2 %d' % i**: This is a string formatting expression. The `%d` is a placeholder for an integer. Given that `i` is 2, this expression will be replaced by `'2 2'`.
2. **`*range(1, n + 1)`**: The `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The `*` operator unpacks this sequence into separate arguments for the `print` function. Therefore, it will print the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

### Determining the Value of `n`:
The problem does not explicitly specify a value for `n`, but since `mat` is a list of `n` lists and each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, and `i` is set to 2, we can infer that `n` must be at least 2. However, the exact value of `n` is not provided, so we must describe the output in terms of `n`.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the `print` statement will output `'2 2'` followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2 2 1 2 ... n (where n is the number of lists in mat and the integers in the range from 1 to n)**

If we assume `n` to be a specific value for clarity, let's assume `n` is 4 for the sake of this example (since the exact value of `n` is not given):

Output: **2 2 1 2 3 4**

However, based on the problem statement and the need for a precise description:

Output: **2 2 1 2 ... n (where n is the number of lists in mat and the integers in the range from 1 to n)**
