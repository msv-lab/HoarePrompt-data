In the given task, the for loop is structured as follows:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. The range function takes an integer, which in this case is derived from the input function. For the loop to execute, the integer provided to the range function must be greater than 0.

Let's break it down:

1. The loop will iterate `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. The loop will only execute if `t` is greater than 0.
3. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted in the state as it is not used in the loop body.

Given this, the state before the loop starts should ensure that the input integer `t` (which represents the number of test cases) is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
