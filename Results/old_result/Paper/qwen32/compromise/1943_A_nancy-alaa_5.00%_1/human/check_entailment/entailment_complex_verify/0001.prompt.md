You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        
        first = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
        
    #State: t is 0; n is undefined; arr is undefined; mpp is undefined; first is undefined; i is undefined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it prints the smallest non-negative integer that is either missing from the list or appears exactly once, ensuring that if there are multiple such integers, the smallest one is chosen.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to find the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.

### Key Observations

1. **MEX Definition**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice will try to add elements to `c` that will increase the MEX as much as possible.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from increasing the MEX by removing elements that Alice would otherwise add.

### Strategy

- Alice will add elements in such a way that the MEX is maximized. If there are multiple elements with the same count, she will choose the one that will help in increasing the MEX.
- Bob will remove elements that would help Alice in increasing the MEX.

### Correctness Analysis

To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's examine the logic:

1. **Counting Elements**: The program uses `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.
2. **Iterating Over Possible Values**: It iterates over possible values from `0` to `n-1` to find the MEX.
3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - If a value `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, it means `i` is not present in the array, so it prints `i` and breaks.
   - If a value `i` is present exactly once and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks.
   - If a value `i` is present exactly once, it sets `first` to `True`.

### Issues in the Program

The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. Here are the issues:

1. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. It simply checks the counts and prints the MEX without considering the game dynamics.
2. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation**: The program does not correctly determine the MEX based on the optimal play by Alice and Bob. It only checks for the presence of elements and their counts, which does not account for the strategic removal of elements by Bob.

### Correct Approach

A correct approach would involve:
- Simulating the turns of Alice and Bob.
- Keeping track of the elements added to `c` and removed from `a`.
- Dynamically calculating the MEX based on the current state of `c`.

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the provided program, it does not correctly determine the game's final score if both players play optimally.
