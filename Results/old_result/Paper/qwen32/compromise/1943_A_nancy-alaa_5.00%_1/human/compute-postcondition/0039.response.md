The code snippet `mpp = Counter(arr)` updates the `mpp` variable to be a `Counter` object that represents the frequency of each element in the list `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `first`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1; `n` is the new input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is a boolean that is True if there was at least one `i` with a frequency of 1 in the original `arr`, otherwise it remains False; `i` is equal to the new `n`.**
