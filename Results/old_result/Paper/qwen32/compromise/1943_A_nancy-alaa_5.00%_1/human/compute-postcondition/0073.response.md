Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1; `n` is the input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is a boolean; `i` is equal to the input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the integer value obtained from the new input. The other variables `t`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `i` remain unchanged except that `i` is now also equal to the newly input integer `n`.
