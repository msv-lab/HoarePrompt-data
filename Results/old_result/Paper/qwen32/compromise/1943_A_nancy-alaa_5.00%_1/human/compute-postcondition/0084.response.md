Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the current `arr`; `first` is True; `i` is a key in `mpp` with a frequency of 1; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain valid, and the only change is that the loop or if statement is exited.
