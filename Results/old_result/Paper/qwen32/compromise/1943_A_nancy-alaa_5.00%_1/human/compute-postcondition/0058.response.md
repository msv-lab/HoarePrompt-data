Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is a boolean; `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `first`) retain their initial values.
