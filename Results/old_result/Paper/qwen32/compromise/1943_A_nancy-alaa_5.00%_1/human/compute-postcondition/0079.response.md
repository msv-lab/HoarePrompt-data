To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the `print` statement:

- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the current `arr`.
- `first` is False.
- `i` is 0 and `i` is not a key in `mpp`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(i)
```

Given the initial state, we know that `i` is explicitly set to 0. The fact that `i` is not a key in `mpp` does not affect the value of `i` itself; it only indicates that the integer `0` does not appear in the list `arr`.

Therefore, the `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`, which is `0`.

Output: **0**
