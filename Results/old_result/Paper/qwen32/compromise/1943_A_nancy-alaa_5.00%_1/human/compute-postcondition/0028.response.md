Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is a boolean; `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `i` remain unchanged except that `i` has been incremented by 1. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
