Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is a boolean; `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the loop or if statement is broken out of. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
