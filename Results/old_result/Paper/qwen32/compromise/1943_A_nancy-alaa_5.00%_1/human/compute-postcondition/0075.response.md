The code snippet provided updates the `mpp` variable to be a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each element in the `arr` list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `first`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1; `n` is the input integer; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the current `arr`; `first` is a boolean; `i` is equal to the input integer.**
