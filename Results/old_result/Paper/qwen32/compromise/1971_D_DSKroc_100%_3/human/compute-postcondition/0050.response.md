Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `s` is a string provided by the user input and has at least 2 characters, `count` is the total number of times consecutive characters in `s` are different, `flag` is 0, indicating there is no instance where a character is less than the next character in the string, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, and `q` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus `len(s) - 1`.**
