Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `s` is a string provided by the user input and has at least 2 characters, `count` is either 1 or 2 if `int(s[i]) == int(s[i + 1])`, or 3 if `int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1])`, `flag` is 1 if `int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1])`, otherwise `flag` remains 0, and `i` is 2. If `int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1])`, then `flag` is set to 1.**
