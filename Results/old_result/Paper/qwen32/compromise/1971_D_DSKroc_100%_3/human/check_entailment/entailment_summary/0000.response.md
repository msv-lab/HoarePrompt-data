Reasoning:
The program is designed to solve the problem by counting the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the binary string. Each transition indicates a point where the string needs to be cut to allow rearrangement into a sorted binary string. The program correctly increments the count for each transition. Additionally, if there are no transitions where a '0' is followed by a '1', it means the string is already sorted or can be made sorted with a single piece, hence it adds 1 to the count.

The logic is correct because:
1. A transition from '1' to '0' or '0' to '1' indicates a boundary where a cut is necessary.
2. If there are no '0's followed by '1's, the string is already sorted or can be sorted in one piece.

The execution summary aligns with the program's logic and behavior. Therefore, the program should work correctly for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
