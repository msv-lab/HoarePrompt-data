The code snippet updates the value of `a[i]` to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. The values of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]` are used to compute the new value of `a[i]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a[i]` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`**.
