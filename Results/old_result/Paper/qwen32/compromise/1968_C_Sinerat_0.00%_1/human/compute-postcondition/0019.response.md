The given code snippet modifies the `a` list by setting the `i`-th element to the sum of the `(i-1)`-th element of `a` and the `(i-1)`-th element of `x`. Given the initial state, `a[0]` is 500 and `a[1]` to `a[n-1]` are 0. The variable `i` is not defined in the provided code snippet, so we assume `i` is a valid index in the range `[1, n-1]`.

Let's break down the impact of the code on the program:
- The value of `a[i]` is updated to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.

Since `a[0]` is 500 and `a[1]` to `a[n-1]` are initially 0, after the execution of the code snippet, `a[i]` will hold the value `500 + x[0]` if `i` is 1, `a[1] + x[1]` if `i` is 2, and so on.

To provide a specific output state, we need to consider the value of `i`. Since `i` is not specified, we'll describe the state in terms of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where the first element is 500, the `i`-th element is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`, and the rest are set to 0 if not yet modified; `_` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10,000; `n` remains greater than 1; `x` remains a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list where the first element is 500, the `i`-th element is updated to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`, and other elements remain 0 unless modified by other operations; `_` remains 0.
