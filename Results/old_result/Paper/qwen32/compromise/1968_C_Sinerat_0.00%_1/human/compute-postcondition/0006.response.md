The code modifies the list `a` by setting each element `a[i]` to be the sum of the previous element `a[i - 1]` and the corresponding element in the list `x` at index `i - 1`. The first element of `a` remains unchanged as it is initialized to 500.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `a` will be updated based on the values in `x`. The first element of `a` stays 500, and each subsequent element `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` will be `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements where `a[0]` is 500 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.**
