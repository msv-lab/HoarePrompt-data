Let's analyze the given task step by step.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`, which means the loop variable `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a[i]` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop variable `i` and the condition `n`.

1. **Adjusting `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was used to calculate `a[i]`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. So, if `i` was `k` in the previous iteration, it should be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

2. **Condition for the loop to continue:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` should be less than `n` for the loop to execute again.

Given that `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `k + 1`. Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Since `n` must be greater than 1 and we are only adjusting the loop variable `i`, the condition `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `n` must be greater than 1

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`**
