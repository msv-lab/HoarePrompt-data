The code snippet provided only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Therefore, the value of `n` is updated to the input integer. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `a`, and `_`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements where `a[0]` is 500 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is the cumulative sum of `x[0]` to `x[i-1]` added to 500; `_` is 0**
