To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Explanation:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
   - This variable `t` is not directly used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this specific print statement.

2. `n` is an input integer.
   - This integer `n` represents the number of elements in the list `x`.

3. `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - This list `x` contains `n` integers.

4. `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements where:
   - `a[0]` is 500.
   - `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is the cumulative sum of `x[0]` to `x[i-1]` added to 500.

### Calculation of List `a`:
- `a[0]` is explicitly defined as 500.
- For `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is calculated as:
  \[
  a[i] = \left( \sum_{j=0}^{i-1} x[j] \right) + 500
  \]
  This means that each subsequent element `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of `x` plus 500.

### Print Statement:
- The statement `print(*a)` prints all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

### Output Description:
- The first element of `a` is always 500.
- Each subsequent element of `a` is the cumulative sum of the elements of `x` up to that point, plus 500.

### Example:
Let's consider an example to illustrate the output:
- Suppose `n = 3` and `x = [10, 20, 30]`.
  - `a[0] = 500`
  - `a[1] = (x[0]) + 500 = 10 + 500 = 510`
  - `a[2] = (x[0] + x[1]) + 500 = (10 + 20) + 500 = 530`
  - Therefore, `a = [500, 510, 530]`

### Final Output:
Based on the above explanation, the output will be the list `a` with all elements printed separated by spaces.

Output: **500 [cumulative_sum_of_x_0_to_x_0 + 500] [cumulative_sum_of_x_0_to_x_1 + 500] ... [cumulative_sum_of_x_0_to_x_n_minus_1 + 500] (where each term in brackets represents the calculated value based on the list x)**

To make it more precise and human-readable:
Output: **500 [500 + x[0]] [500 + x[0] + x[1]] ... [500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-1]]**
