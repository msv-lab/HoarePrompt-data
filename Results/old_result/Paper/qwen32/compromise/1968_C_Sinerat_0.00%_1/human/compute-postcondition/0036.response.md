The code snippet `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` updates the value of `a[i]` to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. The precondition `n` must be greater than `i + 2` and `i` is `i + 2` are still valid after the execution of the code. Only the value of `a[i]` changes.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 2`, `a[i]` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`**.
