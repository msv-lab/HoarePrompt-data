To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the for loop statement and the provided state:

The loop is defined as:
```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will iterate over the range from 1 to `n-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. If `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The state before the loop starts includes `t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `_`. According to the task, we can only adjust the states of `i` and `n`.

Given this, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute. The initial value of `i` does not need to be adjusted because the loop initializes `i` to 1 at the start of the first iteration.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where the first element is 500 and the rest are set to 0; `_` is 0**
