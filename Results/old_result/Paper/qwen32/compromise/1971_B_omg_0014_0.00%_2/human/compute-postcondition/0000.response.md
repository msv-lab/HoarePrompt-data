The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000 and for each of the `t` test cases, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. The value of `t` and the strings `s` are not affected by the code snippet provided. The only change is the assignment of the input value to `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters; `n` is an input integer.**
