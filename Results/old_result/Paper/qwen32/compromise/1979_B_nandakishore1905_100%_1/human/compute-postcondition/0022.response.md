Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input; `k` is 8; `k` is even and not a power of 2; `l` is '11'; `p` is 2; `q` is 2; `f` is 1.**

Natural language: The value of `f` has been updated to 1 by subtracting `q` (which is 2) from its previous value (which is 3). All other variables retain their initial values.
