Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is the current iteration number + 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.**

Natural language: The value of `k` is now the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. All other variables retain their initial values.
