Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input; `k` is 8; `k` is even and not a power of 2; `l` is `'110'`; `p` is 3; `q` is 4; `f` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `f` is updated to `f - q`, which means `f` is now `6 - 4`, resulting in `f` being `2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
