To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, we need to understand the value of `k` based on the given initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 <= t <= 10^4.
2. **`x` and `y`**: Distinct non-negative integers for each test case, with the constraint 0 <= x, y <= 10^9.
3. **`n` and `m`**: Two integers read from the input for each test case.
4. **`k`**: The absolute difference between `n` and `m`, i.e., `k = abs(n - m)`.
5. **Additional Constraint on `k`**: The current value of `k` is a power of 2.

### Analysis:
- Since `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and it is given that `k` is a power of 2, the possible values of `k` are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and so on.
- The exact value of `k` depends on the specific values of `n` and `m` for each test case, but it will always be a power of 2.

### Output:
Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `k` for each test case. However, we know that `k` will be a power of 2.

Output: **k (where k is a power of 2)**
