The value of `f` is updated by subtracting `q` from it. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `f` was initially `k - 3*q`, after the operation, `f` becomes `(k - 3*q) - q`, which simplifies to `k - 4*q`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is the current iteration number + 1, `n` and `m` are integers such that their absolute difference `k` is not a power of two, `l` is the binary representation of `f` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2 raised to the power of `p - 1`, `f` is `k - 4*q` and is not a power of two.**
