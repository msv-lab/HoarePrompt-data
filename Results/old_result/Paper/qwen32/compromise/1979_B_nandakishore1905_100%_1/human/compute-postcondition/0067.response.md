Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is the current iteration number + 2, `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`. If `k` is a power of two, the state remains as described. If `k` is not a power of two, `q` is 2 raised to the power of `p - 1` and is equal to `f`, and `f` is a power of two. If `k` is odd, the state remains as described; `q` is 2 raised to the power of `p - 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `q` is now set to 2 raised to the power of `p - 1`, where `p` is the length of the binary representation of `k` (the absolute difference between `n` and `m`). All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state descriptions.
