Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is the current iteration number + 2, `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of two, the state remains as described. If `k` is odd and not a power of two, the state remains as described. If `k` is even and not a power of two, `l` is the binary representation of `f` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `f` is a power of two.**
