The code snippet modifies the value of `q` by setting it to `2 ** (p - 1)`. Given that `p` is 2, the expression `2 ** (p - 1)` evaluates to `2 ** (2 - 1)`, which is `2 ** 1` or `2`. Therefore, the value of `q` remains unchanged at 2.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input; `k` is 8; `k` is even and not a power of 2; `l` is '11'; `p` is 2; `q` is 2; `f` is 3**
