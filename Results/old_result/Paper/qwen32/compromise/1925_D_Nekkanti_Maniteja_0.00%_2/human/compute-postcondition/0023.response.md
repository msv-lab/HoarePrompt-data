To determine the output of the `print(s % M)` statement, we need to understand the values of the variables involved in the expression `s % M`.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integer values provided by user input, each at least 1.
- `M` is a constant value, `1000000007`.
- `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `1000000007`.
- `s` is calculated as `k * c * a + c^2 * m * (k-1) * k // 2`.
- `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided in the input over `m` iterations.
- `k` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `k-1`.

### Calculating `s`:
- `a` is the sum of `f` values over `m` iterations. Since the specific `f` values are not provided, we can only describe `a` as the sum of these values.
- `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `1000000007`. This means `c` is a value such that `(n * (n - 1) * c) % M = 1`.
- `s` is calculated using the formula `k * c * a + c^2 * m * (k-1) * k // 2`.

### Calculating `s % M`:
- `s % M` means we take the result of `s` and find its remainder when divided by `M`.

### Output Description:
Given the formula for `s` and the fact that all operations are modulo `M`, the output will be the result of the expression `s % M` where `s` is defined as `k * c * a + c^2 * m * (k-1) * k // 2`.

Since the specific values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the `f` values are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `s % M`. However, based on the provided information, the print statement will output the result of this expression.

### Final Output:
Output: **s % M (where s is calculated as k * c * a + c^2 * m * (k-1) * k // 2, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) modulo 1000000007, and a is the sum of all f values provided in the input over m iterations)**
