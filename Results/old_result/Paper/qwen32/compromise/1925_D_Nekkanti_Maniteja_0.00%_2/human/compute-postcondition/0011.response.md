Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the integer values provided by the user's input, which are at least 1; `M` is 1000000007; the list of friend pairs remains unchanged; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `1000000007`; `s` is 0; `a` is `f + f`; `m` must be greater than 0; `u`, `v`, and `f` are the new three integers provided by the user's input; `i` is 1.**

In simple terms: The variable `a` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value (`f`) and the new value of `f` provided by the user's input. All other variables remain unchanged.
