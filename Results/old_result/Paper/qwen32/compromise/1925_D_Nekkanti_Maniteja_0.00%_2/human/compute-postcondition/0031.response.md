Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the new integer values provided by user input, each at least 1; `M` is 1000000007; the list of friend pairs remains unchanged; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `1000000007`; `s` is 0; `a` is 0; `k` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `u`, `v`, and `f` are the new integer values provided by user input, each at least 1.**

Explanation: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, the list of friend pairs, `c`, `s`, `a`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The new variables `u`, `v`, and `f` are assigned the integer values provided by the user input.
