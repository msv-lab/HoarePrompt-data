The provided code snippet reads three integer values from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This means the initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are overwritten by the new values provided by the user.

The other variables (`M`, the list of friend pairs, `c`, `s`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged because they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the new integer values provided by user input, each at least 1; `M` is 1000000007; the list of friend pairs remains unchanged; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `1000000007`; `s` is `k * c * a + c^2 * m * (k-1) * k // 2`; `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided in the input over `m` iterations; `k` is greater than 0; `i` is `k`**.
