To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve with each iteration.

### Loop Analysis

The loop processes multiple test cases. For each test case:
1. It reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
2. It calculates `M` as \(10^9 + 7\).
3. It calculates `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \times (n - 1)\) modulo \(M\).
4. It initializes `s` to 0 and `a` to 0.
5. It reads `m` pairs of integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, and sums up all `f_i` values into `a`.
6. It then updates `s` in a loop `k` times, using the formula:
   \[
   s = s + c \times i \times c \times m + c \times a
   \]
   where `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`.
7. Finally, it prints the value of `s % M`.

### Final Output State

The loop processes each test case independently. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, and `a` are recalculated and reinitialized for each test case. The only variable that accumulates results across different test cases is the printed output `s % M` for each test case.

After all test cases have been processed, there is no accumulation of results from one test case to the next. Each test case's output is independent of the others.

### Output State after All Iterations

The final output state is a series of outputs, one for each test case. The state of the variables at the end of the loop is:

- `n`, `m`, and `k` are the values from the last test case.
- `M` remains \(10^9 + 7\).
- `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \times (n - 1)\) modulo \(M\) for the last test case.
- `s` is the final value of `s` for the last test case, which is printed.
- `a` is the sum of all `f` values for the last test case.

However, since each test case's output is independent and printed immediately, the final state we need to report is the output of the last test case.

### Conclusion

The output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is the output of the last test case. The final printed value for the last test case is `s % M`.

Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

In natural language: The final output state is the result of the last test case, which is the value of `s % M` after processing all `k` iterations for the last set of `n`, `m`, and `k` values provided.
