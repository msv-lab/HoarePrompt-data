### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment to determine if the program correctly solves the given problem.

#### Problem Analysis:

The task is to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for excursions. Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value, and this value increases by 1 each time the pair is chosen.

#### Program Analysis:

The program iterates over multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (m), and the number of excursions (k). It processes m lines of input, each containing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value. The program then calculates a value `s` based on these inputs and outputs `s % M` where `M = 10^9 + 7`.

#### Issues in the Provided Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of the Inverse Modulo:**
   - The program calculates the inverse modulo of `n * (n - 1) // 2` as `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`. This is incorrect because the denominator should be `n * (n - 1) // 2` and not `n * (n - 1) // 1`.
   - The correct line should be `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The program calculates `s` in a loop for `k` iterations with the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. This formula is incorrect and does not correctly compute the expected value.
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values should be calculated based on the probability of selecting each pair and the expected increase in friendship values over k excursions.

3. **Simplification and Correct Formula:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for k excursions can be calculated as follows:
     - For each pair of friends, the expected number of times they are chosen is `k / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
     - The expected sum of friendship values for each pair is the initial friendship value plus the expected increase in friendship values.
     - The expected increase in friendship values for a pair chosen `x` times is the sum of the first `x` natural numbers, which is `x * (x + 1) / 2`.
     - The expected value for all pairs is the sum of the expected values for each pair.

#### Correctness:

Given the issues identified in the provided program, the program is not correct. The program incorrectly calculates the inverse modulo and the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

#### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the program. The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
