### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis

The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` excursions. Each pair of friends starts with an initial friendship value and this value increases by 1 each time the pair is chosen.

#### Program Analysis

The provided program iterates over multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, and then processes `m` lines of input containing pairs of friends and their initial friendship values. The program then calculates a value `s` and outputs it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Calculation of the Inverse Modulo:**
   - The program calculates `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`. This is incorrect because the denominator should be `n * (n - 1) // 2` (the total number of possible pairs), not `n * (n - 1) // 1`.
   - The correct line should be `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The program calculates `s` using the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` in a loop for `k` iterations. This formula is incorrect and does not correctly compute the expected value.
   - The expected value for each pair of friends can be calculated as follows:
     - The probability of selecting a specific pair of friends in one excursion is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
     - Over `k` excursions, the expected number of times a specific pair is chosen is `k / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
     - If a pair is chosen `x` times, the sum of their friendship values is the sum of the first `x` natural numbers, which is `x * (x + 1) / 2`.
     - The expected sum of friendship values for a pair with initial friendship value `f` is `f * (k / (n * (n - 1) // 2) + 1) + (k / (n * (n - 1) // 2)) * ((k / (n * (n - 1) // 2) + 1) / 2)`.
     - The expected value for all pairs is the sum of the expected values for each pair.

#### Correct Formula

The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs over `k` excursions is:

\[ \text{Expected Value} = \sum_{\text{all pairs}} \left( f_i \cdot \left(\frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} + 1\right) + \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot \left(\frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} + 1\right) / 2 \right) \]

Where:
- `f_i` is the initial friendship value of the i-th pair.
- \(\binom{n}{2}\) is the total number of possible pairs, which is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.

The provided program does not use this correct formula and instead uses an incorrect and overly simplistic approach.

#### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the provided program, the program is not correct. The program incorrectly calculates the inverse modulo and the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
