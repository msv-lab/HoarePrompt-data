You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            x = 0
            y = p3
            while y >= x:
                if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                    print(p1 - x + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    x += 1
                    y -= 1
            else:
                print(p3)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 500 test cases, each consisting of three integers representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the conditions provided: if the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1; otherwise, it calculates and prints the maximum possible score that can be achieved under the given constraints.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify that it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description for every possible input. The program is supposed to calculate the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players, or return -1 if the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games.

Let's analyze the code:

### Code Analysis
1. **Sum of Scores Check**:
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2` is not zero. If it is not zero, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even (each game awards an even number of points: 2 for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss).

2. **Max Draws Calculation**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the program prints `p1 + p2` because the maximum number of draws can be the sum of the lower two scores.
   - Otherwise, it uses a while loop to find the maximum number of draws that satisfy the conditions.

### Potential Issues
- **Edge Cases**: We need to ensure that the program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are all zero, or when `p3` is significantly larger than `p1` and `p2`.
- **Inconsistent Scores**: The program should correctly identify when the scores are inconsistent and return `-1`.

### Testing the Code
Let's test the code with the provided examples and some additional edge cases.
