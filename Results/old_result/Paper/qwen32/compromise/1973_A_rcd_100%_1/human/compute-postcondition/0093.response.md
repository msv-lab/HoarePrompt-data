To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop terminates. The loop continues to iterate as long as `y` is greater than or equal to `x`. Inside the loop, there is a conditional check: if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, the loop breaks and the program prints `p1 - x + p3`. Otherwise, `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is decremented by 1. If the loop exits without breaking, the program prints `p3`.

Let's analyze the possible outcomes:

1. **Loop Breaks Inside the Loop:**
   - The loop will break if `p1 - x <= p2 - y` at some point during the iterations. In this case, the output will be `p1 - x + p3` where `x` and `y` are the values at the time of breaking.

2. **Loop Completes All Iterations:**
   - The loop will complete all iterations if `p1 - x > p2 - y` for all values of `x` and `y` until `y < x`. In this case, the output will be `p3`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- After the first iteration: `x` could be 1 and `y` could be `p3 - 1`.
- After the second iteration: `x` could be 2 and `y` could be `p3 - 2`.
- After the third iteration: `x` could be 3 and `y` could be `p3 - 3`.

The loop will terminate when `y < x` or when the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is met. If the loop has not broken by the time `y < x`, it will print `p3`.

Thus, the final output state depends on whether the loop breaks before `y < x` or not. If it breaks, the output is `p1 - x + p3` where `x` and `y` are the values at the time of breaking. If it doesn't break, the output is `p3`.

Since we don't have specific values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, we can't determine the exact value of `x` and `y` at the time of breaking. However, we can describe the general final state:

- **If the loop breaks:** The output will be `p1 - x + p3` where `x` and `y` are the values at the time of breaking.
- **If the loop completes:** The output will be `p3`.

Given the problem statement and the described conditions, the final output state, considering the worst-case scenario where the loop completes all iterations, is:

Output State: **p3.**

In natural language, this means that if the loop does not break during any of its iterations and continues until `y < x`, the program will print the value of `p3`.
