The function `func` accepts three integer parameters `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` where `0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30`, representing the scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order. The function also processes multiple test cases, with the number of test cases `t` satisfying `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. It processes up to 500 such test cases and returns the outcome based on these scores.**
