Output State: **`t` is at least 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\); the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the current value of `p3` remains greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`; otherwise, `p3` retains its original value; `x` is 1; `y` is equal to `p3 - 1`; `p1 - x` is less than `p2 - y`**

In simple terms, the value of `y` has been decremented by 1, so `y` is now `p3 - 1`. All other conditions and variable values remain the same.
