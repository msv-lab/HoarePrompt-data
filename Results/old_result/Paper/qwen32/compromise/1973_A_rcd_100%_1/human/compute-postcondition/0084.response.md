The value of `x` is incremented by 1. Given that `x` was either 0 or 1, after the increment, `x` will be 1 or 2, respectively. Since `y` is defined as `x + 1`, after the increment, `y` will be 2 or 3. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; `x` is 1 or 2; `y` is 2 or 3.**
