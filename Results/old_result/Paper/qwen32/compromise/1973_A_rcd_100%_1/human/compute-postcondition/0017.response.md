The value of `x` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `x` is 1; `y` is equal to `p3`; `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - y`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `x` is 1; `y` is equal to `p3`; `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - y`.**
