The value of `y` is decremented by 1, so `y` becomes `p3 - 1`. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `x` remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is at least 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers, `x` is 1, and `y` is initially equal to `p3` is still valid. Additionally, the condition `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - y` still holds because `y` is now `p3 - 1`, making `p2 - y` equal to `p2 - (p3 - 1)`, which is `p2 - p3 + 1`. Therefore, the updated condition becomes `p1 - 1 > p2 - p3 + 1`, which simplifies to `p1 - p2 > 2 - p3`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; `x` is 1; `y` is `p3 - 1`; and `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - y`.**
