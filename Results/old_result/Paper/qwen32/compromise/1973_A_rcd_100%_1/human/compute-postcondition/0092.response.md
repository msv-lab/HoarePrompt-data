Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input. If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `x` is 1, 2, or 3; `y` is 0, 1, or `x` (and `y` must be at least `x - 1`). In both cases, `y` must be at least `x` or `x - 1` as per their respective conditions.**
