The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used for iteration. The loop will execute `t` times, so the state we need to adjust is `t`.

Given that the loop has just finished an iteration, the value of `t` must have been decremented by 1 in the previous iteration. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `t` should be at least 1.

The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. They will retain their values from the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, and they hold the values read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the current value of `p3` remains greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, `p3` retains its original value.**
