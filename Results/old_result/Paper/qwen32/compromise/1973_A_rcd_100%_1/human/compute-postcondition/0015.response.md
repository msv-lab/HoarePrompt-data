Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `x` is 0; `y` is equal to `p3`; it holds that `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
