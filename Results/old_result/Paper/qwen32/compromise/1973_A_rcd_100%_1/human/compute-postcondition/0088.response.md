Let's analyze the given task step by step based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is at least 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it's part of the initial state).
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
- `x` is 0, 1, or 2.
- `y` is 1, 2, or `x + 1` and `y` must be at least `x` (though `y` is not used in the print statement, it's part of the initial state).

The print statement is:
```python
print(p1 - x + p3)
```

Here, we need to determine the value of `p1 - x + p3` based on the given conditions.

- `p1` and `p3` are integers that are read from the input, so their exact values are not provided, but they are known.
- `x` can be 0, 1, or 2.

Given this information, the value of `p1 - x + p3` can vary based on the value of `x`. Here's a breakdown:

- If `x = 0`, then `p1 - x + p3` simplifies to `p1 + p3`.
- If `x = 1`, then `p1 - x + p3` simplifies to `p1 - 1 + p3`.
- If `x = 2`, then `p1 - x + p3` simplifies to `p1 - 2 + p3`.

Since the exact values of `p1` and `p3` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, we can describe it precisely based on the possible values of `x`.

Output: **p1 - x + p3 (where p1 and p3 are integers read from the input, and x is 0, 1, or 2)**
