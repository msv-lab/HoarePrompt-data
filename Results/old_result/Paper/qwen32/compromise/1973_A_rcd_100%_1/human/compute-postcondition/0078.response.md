The value of `x` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; `x` is 1; `y` is equal to `p3`; and `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - y`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; `x` is 1; `y` is equal to `p3`; and `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - y`.**
