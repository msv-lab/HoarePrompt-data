The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements of the list `a`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `i` and how it changes during the loop iteration.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input and must have at least 2 elements.
- `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `cntl[i]` is 2 and all other `cntl[j]` for `j != i` are 0.

In the loop:
- `i` takes on the value of each element in the list `a` one by one.

Since the loop iterates over the elements of `a`, the state of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be the next element in `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `cntl`) remain unchanged in terms of their definitions and constraints.

Let's denote the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `a[k]` for some index `k`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `a[k+1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input and must have at least 2 elements, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `cntl[i]` is 2 and all other `cntl[j] for j != i` are 0, `i` is the next element in the list `a`**.

To be more specific, if `i` was `a[k]` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `a[k+1]`.

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input and must have at least 2 elements, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `cntl[i]` is 2 and all other `cntl[j] for j != i` are 0, `i` is the next element in the list `a`**.

If we assume `i` was `a[0]` at the end of the first iteration, then at the start of the second iteration, `i` will be `a[1]`.

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input and must have at least 2 elements, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `cntl[i]` is 2 and all other `cntl[j] for j != i` are 0, `i` is `a[1]`**.
