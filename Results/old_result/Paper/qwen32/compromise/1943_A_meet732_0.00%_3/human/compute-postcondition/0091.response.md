The value of `c` is decremented by 1. The values of `n` and `cntl[j]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `cntl[j]` is less than 2, and `c` is decreased by 1 from its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is decreased by 1 from its previous value.**
