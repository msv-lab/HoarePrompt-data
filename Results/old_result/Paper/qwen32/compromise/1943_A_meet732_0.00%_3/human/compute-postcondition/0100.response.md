Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and is less than or equal to `n`; `c` is decreased by 1 from its previous value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the value of `n` remains at least 1. The value of `j` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value and still satisfies the condition of being less than or equal to `n`. The value of `c` has been decreased by 1 from its previous value. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
