The code snippet `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value at the index `i` in the list `cntl` by 1. Given the initial state, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `cntl[i]` which is 1. After the increment, `cntl[i]` will be 2.

The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is in the `cntl` list where the element at index `i` is now 2 instead of 1.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input and must have at least two elements, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `cntl[i]` which is 2, `i` is the next element in the list `a`**.
