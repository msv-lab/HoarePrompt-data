To determine what will be printed by the `print(j)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the operations described.

### Initial State:

- `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input.
- `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times `i` appears in `a` for each `i` from 0 to `n`.
- `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
- `j` is `j + 1`.
- `c` is decreased by 1.

### Analysis:

The key information here is the operation `j = j + 1`. This operation increments the value of `j` by 1. However, the initial value of `j` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of its relationship to the initial value of `j`.

If we denote the initial value of `j` as `j_initial`, after the operation `j = j + 1`, the value of `j` will be `j_initial + 1`.

### Print Statement:

The `print(j)` statement will print the value of `j` after it has been incremented by 1.

### Output:

Since we do not know the exact initial value of `j`, we can only describe the output in terms of the operation performed on `j`.

Output: **j (where j is the initial value of j plus 1)**
