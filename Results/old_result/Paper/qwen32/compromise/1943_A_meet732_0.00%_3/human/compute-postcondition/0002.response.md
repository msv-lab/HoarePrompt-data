The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as per the given initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input**.
