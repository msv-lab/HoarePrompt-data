The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
