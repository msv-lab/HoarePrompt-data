### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem by determining the final score of the game based on the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - It initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
   - It then iterates through the array `a` and increments the corresponding index in `cntl` for each element.

3. **Determining the MEX:**
   - If `cntl[0]` (the count of 0s in the array) is 0, the MEX is 0 because 0 is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `c` to be the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`.
   - It then iterates through the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). For each `j`, if the count of `j` in `cntl` is less than 2, it decrements `c`. If `c` becomes 0 or `j` reaches `n`, the program prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX, and Bob aims to minimize it. The logic in the program reflects this by ensuring that the smallest possible MEX is found after both players have played optimally. The key idea is that if there are not enough 0s, the MEX will be 0. Otherwise, the program checks for the smallest number that appears less than twice, as this will be the MEX after both players have made their moves.

5. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each element in the array.
   - It correctly handles the case where there are no 0s in the array by outputting 0.
   - It correctly iterates through the possible values to find the smallest one that appears less than twice, which is the MEX after the game ends.

### Conclusion:

The program accurately implements the logic needed to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. It handles all edge cases and efficiently computes the result for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
