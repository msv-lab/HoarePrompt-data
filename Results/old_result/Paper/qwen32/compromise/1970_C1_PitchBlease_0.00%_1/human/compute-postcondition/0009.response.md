Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree; `tree` is a dictionary where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node i, and `tree[start]` must contain at least one neighbor; `queue` is a deque that is now empty or contains remaining tuples after removing the first one; `visited` is a set containing the `start` node, `current` node, and possibly other nodes; `current` is equal to `start` or another node in the tree; `dist` is a non-negative integer representing the distance from `start` to `current`; `neighbor` is a neighbor of `current` that is not in the `visited` set before this operation; `current` is not equal to `target`.**

The `visited` set now includes the `neighbor` node in addition to the nodes it previously contained. Other variables remain unchanged.
