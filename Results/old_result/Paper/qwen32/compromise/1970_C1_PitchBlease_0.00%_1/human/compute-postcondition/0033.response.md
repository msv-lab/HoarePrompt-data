Postcondition: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; `tree` is a dictionary where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node i and `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor; `queue` is a deque that includes the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`; `visited` contains all nodes that are reachable from `start` including `next_node` and `neighbor` and now also includes `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`; `current` is `next_node`; `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `tree[current]` that has not been processed yet.**
