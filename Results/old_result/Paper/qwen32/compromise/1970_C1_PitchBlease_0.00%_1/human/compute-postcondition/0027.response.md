The code adds `neighbor` to the `visited` set. This means that `neighbor` is now included in the set of nodes that are reachable from `start`, along with all previously visited nodes.

Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; `tree` is a dictionary where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node i and `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor; `queue` is a deque that no longer contains `next_node`; `visited` is a set containing all nodes that are reachable from `start` including `next_node` and `neighbor`; `current` is `next_node`. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns `dist`, which is the next value in the deque after `next_node`. Otherwise, no return value is specified and the state of `dist` remains as the next value in the deque after `next_node`. Additionally, `neighbor` is not in `visited`.**
