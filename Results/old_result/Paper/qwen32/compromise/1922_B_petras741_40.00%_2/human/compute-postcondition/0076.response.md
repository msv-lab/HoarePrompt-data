The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` (which is 2) to the list `eta`. Since `eta` was initially an empty list, it will now contain the single element `2`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `buffer`, `n`, `w`, `q`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input, `q` is a list where each index `k` has a value equal to the number of times `k` appears in the list `w`, `j` is 2, `eta` is a list containing the value 2**.
