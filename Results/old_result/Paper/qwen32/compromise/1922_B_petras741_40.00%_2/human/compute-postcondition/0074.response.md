Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer (greater than or equal to 0), `w` is a list of integers converted from the input, `q` is a list where each index `k` has a value equal to the number of times `k` appears in the list `w`. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing the value `j`. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list.**
