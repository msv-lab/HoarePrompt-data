The code snippet `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value at the index `w[j]` in the list `q` by 1. Given the initial state, `j` is 1, so `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `q[w[0]]` which is 1 and `q[w[1]]` which is 2, `j` is 1**.

In simple terms, the value at the index `w[1]` in the list `q` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
