Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer (greater than or equal to 0), `w` is a list of integers converted from the input, `q` is a list where each index `k` has a value equal to the number of times `k` appears in the list `w`, `eta` is a list containing the value `j`, and `q[j]` is greater than 0.**

In natural language: The variable `eta` now contains the value `j`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
