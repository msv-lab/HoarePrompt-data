Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the new input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in the list `w`, `eta` is a list containing all unique integers from the list `w`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta` and is not equal to 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]] + q[eta[1]] + q[eta[2]] + q[eta[3]]`, `res` is updated to the initial `res` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, and `j` is 3. If `j` is greater than 1000, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues as per the original conditions without any modifications to the variables.**
