Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `q[w[0]]` which is incremented by 1, `q[w[1]]` which is incremented by 1, `q[w[2]]` which is incremented by 1, and so on until `q[w[n-1]]` which is incremented by 1, `j` is n-1`**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all `n` iterations, the variable `t` remains greater than 0, `i` remains 0, and `buffer` remains an empty list. The variable `n` is still the input integer that is at least 3, and `w` is still the list of integers obtained from the input. The list `q` will have been updated such that for each index `k` from 0 to `n-1`, the value at `q[w[k]]` is incremented by 1. The variable `j` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
