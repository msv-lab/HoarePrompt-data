To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the variables involved in the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information provided in the initial state:

- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, which contains all unique integers from the list `w`.
- `eta_ln` equals 1, meaning the list `eta` contains exactly one unique integer.

Since `eta_ln` equals 1, it implies that the list `w` contains only one unique integer. This means that the list `q`, which counts the occurrences of each integer in `w`, will have exactly one non-zero entry corresponding to the single unique integer in `w`.

However, the value of `n` is not directly specified in the initial state. The expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` computes the number of combinations of `n` items taken 3 at a time, which is mathematically represented as \( \binom{n}{3} \).

Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, let's consider the possible values of `n`:

1. If `n = 0`, the expression evaluates to `0 * (-1) * (-2) // 6 = 0`.
2. If `n = 1`, the expression evaluates to `1 * 0 * (-1) // 6 = 0`.
3. If `n = 2`, the expression evaluates to `2 * 1 * 0 // 6 = 0`.
4. If `n >= 3`, the expression evaluates to a positive integer.

Since the problem does not provide a specific value for `n` and only specifies that it is a non-negative integer, the most precise description of the output would consider the general form of the expression based on the given conditions.

However, based on the typical context and the fact that the problem specifies `eta_ln` equals 1, it is reasonable to infer that `n` could be any non-negative integer, but the expression will only yield a non-zero result if `n >= 3`.

Given the information and without a specific value for `n`, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 (where n is a non-negative integer)**

If we need to provide a specific output based on common scenarios or typical values, we might consider `n = 3` as a simple example where the expression evaluates to 1. But the most precise answer based on the given information is:

Output: **n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 (where n is a non-negative integer)**
