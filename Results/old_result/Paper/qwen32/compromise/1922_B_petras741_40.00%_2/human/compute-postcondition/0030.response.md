The given print statement is:

```python
print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
```

From the initial state, we know that `n` is an input integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. The expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` calculates the number of ways to choose 3 items from `n` items without regard to order, which is also known as the binomial coefficient "n choose 3" or \( \binom{n}{3} \).

Since `n` is not explicitly given a value, we will describe the output in terms of `n`. The expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` will compute the exact number of combinations of 3 items from `n` items.

Thus, the output will be the result of the above expression for a given `n`.

Output: **n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 (where n is the input integer greater than or equal to 3)**
