Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is `t - 1` (the last iteration), `buffer` is an empty list.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` is 0**: After all iterations, the loop has completed its execution for all test cases, so `t` (which represents the number of test cases) is now 0.
- **`i` is `t - 1`**: `i` is the loop variable that iterates from 0 to `t-1`. After the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `t - 1`.
- **`buffer` is an empty list**: The `buffer` list is not modified within the loop, so it remains empty throughout the execution.

The loop has processed all `t` test cases, and since `t` is now 0, the loop has finished executing. All other variables (`n`, `w`, `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, `res`, etc.) are specific to each iteration and do not persist after the loop completes. Therefore, they do not need to be mentioned in the final output state.
