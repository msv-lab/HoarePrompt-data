Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input, `q` is a list where each index `k` has a value equal to the number of times `k` appears in the list `w`, `eta` is a list where each index `j` (from 0 to `n`) has a value equal to the number of times `j` appears in the list `w` and `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `rho` is `rho + q[eta[2]]`, `eta_ln` is greater than 1, and `res` is `res + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho + q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) * (q[eta[2]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`. If `j` is greater than 1000, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
