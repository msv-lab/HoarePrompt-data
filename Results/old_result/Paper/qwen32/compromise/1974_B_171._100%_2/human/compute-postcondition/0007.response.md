Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `encoded`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a string `decoded` of the same length `n`, where each character is the reverse counterpart of the corresponding character in `encoded` as per a predefined `char_map`.**
