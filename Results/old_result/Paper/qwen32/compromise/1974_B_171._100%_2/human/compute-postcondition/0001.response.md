The code snippet provided initializes an empty dictionary `char_map`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `encoded`, or `unique_chars`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the same initial conditions for those variables, with the addition of the newly created empty dictionary `char_map`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `encoded` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`; `char_map` is an empty dictionary.**
