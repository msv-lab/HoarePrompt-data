You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the first value as the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string (`n`) and the encoded string (`b`).

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - For each encoded string `b`, the program defines a function `func_1` to decode it.
   - Inside `func_1`, it first creates a set of unique characters from `b` and sorts them to form the auxiliary string `r`.
   - It then constructs a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on).
   - Using this mapping, it constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding mapped character.

3. **Output**:
   - The decoded string for each test case is stored in the `results` list, which is then printed out.

### Verification of Correctness:

- The program correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them to form `r`.
- It accurately maps each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart.
- It applies this mapping to the encoded string to produce the original string `s`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. It handles multiple test cases efficiently and produces the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
