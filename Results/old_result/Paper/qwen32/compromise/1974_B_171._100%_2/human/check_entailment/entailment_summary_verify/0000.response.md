Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Description Recap
Polycarp encodes a string `s` by:
1. Creating a string `r` which consists of all distinct characters of `s` in alphabetical order.
2. Replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric character from `r`.

To decode, we need to reverse this process:
1. Identify the unique characters in the encoded string `b` and sort them alphabetically to form `r`.
2. Create a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character of `r` is mapped to the last, the second to the second last, and so on).
3. Use this mapping to decode the string `b`.

### Provided Code Analysis
The provided code attempts to decode the encoded string `b` by:
1. Extracting unique characters from `b` and sorting them to form `r`.
2. Creating a mapping `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` using:
   ```python
   char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
   ```
3. Decoding `b` using this mapping.

### Function Summary
The function summary states that the function takes a string `encoded` and returns a new string `decoded` where each character is replaced by its reverse counterpart based on the sorted order of unique characters in `encoded`.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment claims that the provided code is incorrect because it uses the same mapping logic for decoding as it does for encoding. It suggests that the mapping should be reversed for decoding.

### Detailed Reasoning
Let's verify if the provided code correctly reverses the encoding process.

1. **Creating `r`**: The code correctly identifies the unique characters in `b` and sorts them alphabetically to form `r`.
2. **Creating `char_map`**: The code maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r`. This is done correctly for decoding as well because:
   - If `r` is `['a', 'b', 'c']`, the mapping should be `{'a': 'c', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'a'}`.
   - The provided code does exactly this:
     ```python
     char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
     ```
     For `i = 0`, `char_map['a'] = 'c'`.
     For `i = 1`, `char_map['b'] = 'b'`.
     For `i = 2`, `char_map['c'] = 'a'`.

3. **Decoding `b`**: The code uses the `char_map` to decode `b` correctly by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped value.

### Conclusion
The provided code correctly reverses the encoding process and accurately decodes the string `b` to obtain the original string `s`. The original assessment is incorrect because the code does handle the decoding correctly.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
