Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code attempts to decode the encoded string `b` by reversing the encoding process. However, there is a crucial mistake in the logic used to map the characters back to their original form.

The problem states that each character in the string `s` is replaced by its symmetric character from the string `r` (which consists of all distinct letters of the string `s` written in alphabetical order). To decode, we need to reverse this mapping:

1. Construct the string `r` from the encoded string `b` by taking all unique characters and sorting them alphabetically.
2. Create a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character of `r` is mapped to the last, the second to the second last, and so on).
3. Use this mapping to decode the string `b`.

However, the code provided uses the same mapping logic for decoding as it does for encoding. This is incorrect because the mapping needs to be reversed. Specifically, the line:
```python
char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
```
is correct for encoding, but for decoding, it should map each character in `r` back to its original position, which means the mapping should be the reverse of what is currently implemented.

To fix this, we need to create a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding character in the reverse order of `r`. This can be achieved by swapping the keys and values in the `char_map` dictionary after constructing it.

Here's the corrected version of the function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]] = unique_chars[i]
    decoded = ''.join((char_map[ch] for ch in encoded))
    return decoded
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all test cases. Since the original code does not handle the decoding correctly, the correctness is **False**.
