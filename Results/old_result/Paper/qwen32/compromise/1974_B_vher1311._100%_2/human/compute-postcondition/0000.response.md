The code snippet sorts the unique characters from each string in the `encoded` list and concatenates them into a single string `r`. The `encoded` list remains unchanged, and the new variable `r` is created.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and its length n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `r` is a string containing unique characters from all strings in `encoded`, sorted in ascending order.**
