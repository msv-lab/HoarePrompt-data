The code snippet provided iterates over each string in the `encoded` list and for each character in these strings, it looks up the corresponding mirrored character in the `mapping` dictionary. The result is a new string formed by joining these mirrored characters.

Given:
- `encoded` is a list of strings.
- `r` is a string of unique characters from all strings in `encoded`, sorted in ascending order.
- `mapping` is a dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to the character at its mirrored position from the end of `r`.

Output State: **The program returns a string formed by joining the mirrored characters from the `encoded` list based on the `mapping` dictionary.**

To clarify:
- Each character in the strings within `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding mirrored character from `mapping`.
- The final result is a concatenated string of these mirrored characters.
