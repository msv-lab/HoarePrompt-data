Let's carefully analyze the given problem description, the provided code, and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is correct.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to decode a string `b` to get back the original string `s`.
- The decoding involves using an auxiliary string `r`, which consists of unique characters from `b` in alphabetical order.
- Each character in `b` is replaced by its symmetric character from `r`.

### Provided Code:
```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    b = data[index]
    index += 1
    results.append(func_1(b))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join((mapping[char] for char in encoded))
```

### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` takes an encoded string and decodes it by creating a mapping of each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r`.

### Original Assessment:
- The assessment claims the code is incorrect because the mapping is created incorrectly.
- The code maps each character in `r` to `r[-(i + 1)]`, which is incorrect. It should map to `r[len(r) - 1 - i]`.

### Detailed Analysis:
- The string `r` is correctly constructed as the sorted set of unique characters from the input string `b`.
- The mapping dictionary is created with the line `mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}`.
- Here, `r[-(i + 1)]` is equivalent to `r[len(r) - 1 - i]`. This is because `-(i + 1)` in Python indexing is the same as `len(r) - 1 - i`.
- Therefore, the mapping is correctly assigning each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart.

### Verification:
Let's verify the code with the provided example:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  6
  abcdef
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  fedcba
  ```
- The string `r` would be `abcdef`.
- The mapping would be:
  - `a -> f`
  - `b -> e`
  - `c -> d`
  - `d -> c`
  - `e -> b`
  - `f -> a`
- The decoded string would be `fedcba`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly identifies the code as incorrect. The mapping is actually correct as the code maps each character to its symmetric counterpart accurately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
