Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, which is supposed to decode the string but instead performs the encoding operation again. The mapping created in the function maps each character in the sorted set of the encoded string to its symmetric counterpart, which is the same operation used for encoding, not decoding.

To correct the program, the mapping should be reversed. That is, each character in the sorted set of the encoded string should be mapped to its corresponding original character, not its symmetric counterpart. Here's the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[-(i + 1)]: r[i] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join((mapping[char] for char in encoded))
```

With this change, the program will correctly decode the encoded strings.
