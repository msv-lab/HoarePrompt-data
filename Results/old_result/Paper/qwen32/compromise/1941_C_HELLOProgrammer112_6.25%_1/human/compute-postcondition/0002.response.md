Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` which is the number of test cases (an integer between 1 and 10^4), and for each test case, it accepts `n` which is the length of a string (an integer between 1 and 10^6), and `s` which is the string itself (consisting of lowercase Latin letters). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. The function returns a value for each test case based on the provided string `s`.**
