### Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not solve the problem correctly. The program simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and prints their sum, which does not give the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful.

The key issue is that counting the occurrences of "map" and "pie" does not account for the possibility of overlapping substrings or the most efficient way to remove characters to eliminate these substrings. For example, in the test case:

**Input:**
```
1
7
mapmapie
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

The program outputs `2` because it counts "map" and "pie" once each, but the correct approach would involve removing the minimum number of characters to eliminate both substrings, which is `3` in this case. The program does not consider the optimal way to remove characters to achieve this.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using dynamic programming to find the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie" from the string.

### Final: **False**
