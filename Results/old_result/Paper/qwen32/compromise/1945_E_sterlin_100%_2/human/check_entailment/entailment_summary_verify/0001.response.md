### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not contain the logic necessary to solve the problem. The functions `func_1` through `func_5` are only responsible for reading input in various forms, but they do not implement the required algorithm to determine the swaps needed to ensure that after performing the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.

The problem requires a specific algorithmic approach to solve it, which involves:
1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reading the size of the permutation `n` and the target number `x`.
3. Reading the permutation `p`.
4. Determining the necessary swaps (up to 2) to ensure that after the binary search, the element at position `l` is equal to `x`.
5. Outputting the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped.

Since the provided code lacks this algorithmic logic, it is indeed incorrect for solving the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
