The original assessment is **incorrect**. The annotated code does implement the required logic to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's behavior and reasoning based on the annotations:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x` using `func_2`.
   - It reads the permutation `p` using `func_3`.

2. **Mapping Indices:**
   - The program creates a dictionary `num_indx` that maps each number in the permutation to its index (1-based).

3. **Binary Search Setup:**
   - It initializes `left` to 0 and `right` to `n`.

4. **Binary Search Execution:**
   - The program performs a binary search on the permutation `p`:
     - It calculates `mid` as the midpoint of `left` and `right`.
     - It marks the element at `mid` as seen in the `seen` list.
     - It updates `left` or `right` based on whether `p[mid]` is less than or equal to `x`.

5. **Post-Binary Search Handling:**
   - If the element at `left` is `x`, it prints `0` because no swaps are needed.
   - If `x` was not seen during the binary search, it prints `1` and swaps the element at `left` with `x`.
   - If `x` was seen during the binary search, it performs two swaps:
     - It finds an unseen element and swaps it with `x`.
     - It then swaps that same element with the element at `left`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of swaps performed and the indices involved in the swaps.

### Validation with Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points, showing how the binary search is executed and how swaps are determined and performed.
- The logic aligns with the problem description, ensuring that the binary search will find `x` after performing at most 2 swaps.

### Conclusion:
The program is complete and correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

**Final: True**
