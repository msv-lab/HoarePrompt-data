**Reasoning:**

The original assessment claims that the provided code does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. However, upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it is evident that the code does indeed contain the necessary logic to perform the required operations: swapping elements and performing a binary search.

Here is a breakdown of the annotated code:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `t = func_1()`: Reads the number of test cases.
   - `(n, x) = func_2()`: Reads the length of the permutation and the number to be found for each test case.
   - `p = func_3()`: Reads the permutation as a list of integers.

2. **Mapping Indices:**
   - `num_indx = {num: indx + 1 for (indx, num) in enumerate(p)}`: Creates a dictionary to map each number to its index in the permutation.

3. **Binary Search Simulation:**
   - `seen = [0] * n`: Initializes a list to keep track of seen elements.
   - `left = 0` and `right = n`: Initializes the left and right pointers for the binary search.
   - The `while` loop performs the binary search simulation:
     - `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`: Calculates the middle index.
     - `seen[p[mid] - 1] = 1`: Marks the middle element as seen.
     - Adjusts `left` or `right` based on whether the middle element is less than or equal to `x`.

4. **Determining Output:**
   - If `p[left] == x`, it means `x` is already at the correct position, so no swaps are needed (`print(0)`).
   - If `x` has not been seen (`not seen[x - 1]`), it means `x` is not in the current search range, so one swap is needed to bring `x` into the range (`print(1)` followed by the indices to swap).
   - If `x` has been seen but is not at the correct position, it means two swaps are needed to bring `x` to the correct position (`print(2)` followed by the indices to swap).

The code correctly implements the logic to perform the required operations and determine the minimum number of swaps needed to ensure the binary search finds `x` at the correct position. Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect.

**Final: False**
