Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the array in either ascending or descending order.

The provided program instead finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference, which does not necessarily give the maximum beauty of the array as defined in the problem description.

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
5
100 54 80 43 90
```

Expected Output:
```
57
```

Explanation of Expected Output:
By sorting the array in ascending order, we get [43, 54, 80, 90, 100]. The beauty of this array is (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57.

However, the provided program would output 97 (100 - 3), which is not the correct maximum beauty.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
