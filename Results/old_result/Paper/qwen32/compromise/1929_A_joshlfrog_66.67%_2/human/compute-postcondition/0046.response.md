Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `l` is a new input integer that must be greater than `i + 1`; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input string split by spaces; `i` is `i + 1`. If `nums[i] > x`, then `x` is updated to `nums[i]`. `e` is `e + 1`. If `nums[i] < y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[i]`.**
