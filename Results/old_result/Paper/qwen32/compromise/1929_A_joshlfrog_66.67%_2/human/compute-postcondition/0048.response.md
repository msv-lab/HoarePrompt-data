To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500. This variable `t` is not directly used in the print statement.
2. `l` is a new input integer. This variable `l` is used in the expression `e = e + l`, but `e` itself is not used anywhere in the code snippet provided.
3. `nums` is a list of integers derived from a new input string split by spaces. This means `nums` is populated with integers based on the input string.
4. `x` is the maximum value in `nums`. This is the largest integer in the `nums` list.
5. `y` is the minimum value in `nums`. This is the smallest integer in the `nums` list.
6. `e` is `e + l`. However, `e` is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(x - y)
```

This statement calculates the difference between the maximum value (`x`) and the minimum value (`y`) in the `nums` list and prints the result.

Since the specific values of `nums` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `x - y`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the `nums` list.

Output: **x - y (where x is the maximum value in the `nums` list and y is the minimum value in the `nums` list)**
