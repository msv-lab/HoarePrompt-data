Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `l` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input string split by spaces; `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`; `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.**

In simple terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, `x` will hold the largest number from the list `nums`, and `y` will hold the smallest number from the list `nums`. The values of `t` and `l` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
