To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500.
- `l` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers derived from an input string split by spaces.
- `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`.
- `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.

Code Snippet:
```python
print(x - y)
```

Explanation:
- `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`. This means `x` is the largest integer in the list.
- `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`. This means `y` is the smallest integer in the list.
- The expression `x - y` computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums`.

Since the exact values of `nums` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `x - y`. However, we know that `x - y` represents the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums`.

Output: **x - y (where x is the maximum value in the list `nums` and y is the minimum value in the list `nums`)**
