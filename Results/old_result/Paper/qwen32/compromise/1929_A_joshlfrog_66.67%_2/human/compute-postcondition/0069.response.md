The code snippet `y = nums[i]` updates the value of `y` to the value of `nums[i]`. Given that `i` is 5, `y` is now set to `nums[5]`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `t` is still an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500.
- `l` is still a new input integer that must be greater than 5.
- `nums` is still a list of integers derived from the new input string split by spaces.
- `e` is still `e + 1`.
- `x` is still `nums[5]` if `nums[5]` is greater than the original `x`; otherwise, `x` remains `nums[4]` if `nums[4]` was greater than the original `x`; otherwise, `x` remains 0.
- `i` is still 5.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `l` is a new input integer that must be greater than 5, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input string split by spaces, `e` is `e + 1`, `x` is `nums[5]` if `nums[5]` is greater than the original `x`; otherwise, `x` remains `nums[4]` if `nums[4]` was greater than the original `x`; otherwise, `x` remains 0, `y` is `nums[5]`, `i` is 5.**
