The code snippet `x = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `x`. Given that `nums[i]` is greater than `x` and `x` was initially 0, `x` will now hold the value of `nums[i]`.

The other variables (`t`, `l`, `y`, `e`) are not affected by this assignment. The value of `nums` remains unchanged as well.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `l` is a new input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input string split by spaces, `x` is `nums[i]`, `y` is 100000000, `e` is `e + 1`.**
