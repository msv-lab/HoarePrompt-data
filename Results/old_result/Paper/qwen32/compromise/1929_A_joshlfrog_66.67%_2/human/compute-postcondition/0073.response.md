Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `e` is equal to `t`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times; for each of the `t` iterations, the loop processed a list `nums` of length `l` with integers derived from the input, and for each list, it calculated `x` as the maximum value and `y` as the minimum value, printing `x - y`.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the loop variable `e` will have the same value as `t`, meaning the loop has run `t` times. For each of these `t` iterations, the loop processed a list of integers, found the maximum and minimum values in that list, and printed the difference between them. The variables `l` and `nums` will reflect the values from the last iteration, and `x` and `y` will hold the maximum and minimum values from that last list, respectively.
