The code snippet `y = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[4]` to `y`. The variables `t`, `l`, `nums`, `e`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `y`.

Given that `i` is 4, `y` is updated to the value of `nums[4]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `l` is a new input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input string split by spaces, `e` is `e + 1`, `x` is `nums[4]` if `nums[4]` is greater than the original `x`; otherwise, `x` remains 0, `y` is `nums[4]`, `i` is 4.**
