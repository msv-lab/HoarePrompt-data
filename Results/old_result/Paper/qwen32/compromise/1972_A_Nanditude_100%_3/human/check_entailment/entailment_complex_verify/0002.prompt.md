You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of problems. a is a list of length n (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the difficulties of the proposed problems, and b is a list of length n (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9) representing the expected difficulties of the problems. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.

    #State: The loop has finished executing `t` times, and for each of the `t` test cases, the value of `cnt` (which represents the number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a`) has been printed. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `cnt`, and `i` will reflect the state of the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of problems `n`, a list `a` of proposed difficulties, and a list `b` of expected difficulties. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a` as `a` is iterated through sequentially.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We have two lists `a` and `b` of the same length `n`, where both are initially sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The goal is to ensure that `a[i] <= b[i]` for all `i` by adding the minimum number of new problems.
- When a new problem with difficulty `w` is added, it is inserted into `a`, `a` is sorted, and the highest difficulty problem is removed.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iterating through the lists `a` and `b` simultaneously. It uses a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of new problems needed.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program logic:
1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Test Cases Loop**: For each test case:
   - It reads the number of problems `n`.
   - It reads the list `a` and the list `b`.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to 0 and an index `i` to 0.
   - It iterates over each element in `b` using index `j`.
   - For each `b[j]`, it checks if `b[j] < a[i]`:
     - If true, it increments the counter `cnt` (indicating a new problem is needed).
     - If false, it increments the index `i` (indicating that the current problem in `a` can be matched with the current problem in `b`).
3. **Output**: After processing all elements in `b`, it prints the counter `cnt`.

### Issues in the Program:
The program does not correctly simulate the process of adding new problems and removing the most difficult one. The program simply counts how many times an element in `b` is less than the corresponding element in `a`, which does not account for the removal of the most difficult problem and the re-sorting of the list `a`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Iterate over both lists `a` and `b` simultaneously.
2. If `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, add a new problem (increment `cnt`).
3. Remove the most difficult problem from `a` after adding a new one and re-sort `a`.
4. Continue this process until all elements in `a` are less than or equal to the corresponding elements in `b`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. It only counts the number of mismatches without simulating the addition and removal of problems.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
