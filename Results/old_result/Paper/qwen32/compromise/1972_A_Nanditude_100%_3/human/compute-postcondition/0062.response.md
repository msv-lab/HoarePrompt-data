The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. Since `j` is currently `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will not execute again if `j` is not incremented. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be reset to 0, and `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are newly input lists of integers, `j` is 0**
