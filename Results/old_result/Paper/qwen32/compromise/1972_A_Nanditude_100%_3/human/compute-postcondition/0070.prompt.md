You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of problems. a is a list of length n (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the difficulties of the proposed problems, and b is a list of length n (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9) representing the expected difficulties of the problems. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        i = 0
        
        for j in range(n):
            if b[j] < a[i]:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing `t` times, and for each of the `t` test cases, the value of `cnt` (which represents the number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a`) has been printed. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `cnt`, and `i` will reflect the state of the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the number of problems, a list `a` of length `n` representing the difficulties of the proposed problems, and a list `b` of length `n` representing the expected difficulties of the problems. For each test case, the function evaluates whether the proposed difficulties match the expected difficulties and returns a result indicating whether the proposed difficulties are correct or not.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
