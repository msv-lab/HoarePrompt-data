The code snippet only initializes the variable `i` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `cnt`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input; `cnt` is 0; `i` is 0.**
