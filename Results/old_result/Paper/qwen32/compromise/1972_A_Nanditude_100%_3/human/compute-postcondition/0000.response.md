Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `n`, `a`, and `b` are still as described in the initial state for each test case.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain as described in the initial state and are yet to be assigned values specific to each test case.
