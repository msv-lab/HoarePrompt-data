Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input, `j` is 2. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, `cnt` is 2 and `i` is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1 and `i` is 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. All other conditions and values remain the same.
