In the given for loop, the loop head only contains the variable `_` and `t`. The variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't intend to use, and `t` is the number of iterations the loop will run, which is determined by the input integer `t`.

To ensure that the loop executes, the only variable we can adjust in the loop head is `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are mentioned as being part of the initial state for each test case, but they are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
