The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of problems `n`, a list `a` of proposed difficulties, and a list `b` of expected difficulties. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a` as `a` is iterated through sequentially.
