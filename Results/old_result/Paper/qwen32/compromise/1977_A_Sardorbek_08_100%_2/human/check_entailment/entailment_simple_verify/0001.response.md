Let's carefully analyze the problem description and the provided code, including the annotations, to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Recap
Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube in each move. The goal is to determine if, after `n` moves, Nikita can have exactly `m` cubes.

### Key Points
1. **Maximum cubes possible**: `n` (all additions).
2. **Minimum cubes possible**: `0` (all removals, but we can't go below 0).
3. **Parity condition**: For `b > m`, the difference `b - m` must be even for it to be possible to reach `m` cubes by alternating additions and removals.

### Analysis of the Program
The provided code is as follows:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Annotations
Annotations provide the state of the program at key points, which align with the code logic.

### Evaluation of the Program
1. **Case `b == c`**:
   - The program correctly prints "YES" if `b == c`, as no moves are needed.
2. **Case `b < c`**:
   - The program prints "NO" if `b < c`. This is incorrect because if `b < c`, it's only impossible if `c > b` and `c - b` is odd. If `c - b` is even, it's possible by alternating additions and removals.
3. **Case `b > c`**:
   - The program prints "Yes" if `b % 2 == c % 2`. This is correct because it checks if the difference `b - c` is even, which is the necessary condition for reaching `m` cubes from `n` moves.
   - The program prints "No" otherwise, which is also correct.

### Correctness
The original assessment correctly identifies that the program incorrectly handles the case when `b < c`. The condition `elif b < c` should check if `c - b` is even, not just print "NO" unconditionally.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the program is indeed incorrect due to the flawed handling of the `b < c` case. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
