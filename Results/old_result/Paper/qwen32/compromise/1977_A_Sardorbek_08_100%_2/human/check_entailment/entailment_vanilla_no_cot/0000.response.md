Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove a cube in each move. Therefore, the number of cubes in the tower after n moves can be any integer from `0` to `n` if `n` is even, and from `1` to `n` if `n` is odd. This is because he can add cubes up to `n` times or remove cubes down to `0` times, achieving any even or odd number of cubes within the bounds.

The key points to check in the program:
1. If `n == m`, it prints 'YES', which is correct because he can just add `m` cubes one by one.
2. If `n < m`, it prints 'NO', which is correct because he cannot have more cubes than the number of moves he has.
3. If `n > m`, the program checks if `b % 2 == c % 2`. This condition checks if `n` and `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd). If they do, it prints 'Yes', which is correct because he can reach `m` from `0` or from `n` by adding/removing cubes in such a way that the parity matches.
4. If `n > m` and `b % 2 != c % 2`, it prints 'No', which is correct because it's impossible to reach an even number of cubes from an odd number of moves or vice versa.

The program handles all the cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
