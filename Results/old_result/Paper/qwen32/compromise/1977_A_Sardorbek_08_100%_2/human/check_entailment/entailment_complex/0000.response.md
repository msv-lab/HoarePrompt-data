### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the given program and compare it with the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, reading two integers `n` and `m` for each test case.

2. **Logic for Determining Output**:
    - If `n == m`, it means the number of moves equals the number of cubes, so it's possible to end up with `m` cubes by adding one cube per move. The program correctly prints 'YES' in this case.
    - If `n < m`, it's impossible to end up with more cubes than the number of moves, since each move can only add or remove one cube. The program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.
    - If `n > m`, the logic checks if `n` and `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd). This is because:
        - If `n` and `m` have the same parity, it's possible to adjust the number of cubes by adding or removing cubes in pairs until the number of cubes matches `m`.
        - If `n` and `m` have different parity, it's impossible to adjust the number of cubes to match `m` because each move changes the parity of the number of cubes.

3. **Output**: The program prints 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' based on the above conditions. The problem statement allows for any case of these answers, so the case of 'Yes' and 'No' is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible for Nikita to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
