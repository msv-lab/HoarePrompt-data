Reasoning:  
The program correctly handles the logic for determining if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. If `n == m`, it is trivially possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves (just add one cube at a time).
2. If `n < m`, it is impossible to end up with `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes that can be added is `n`, which is less than `m`.
3. If `n > m`, the key observation is that the difference between `n` and `m` must be even. This is because each move either adds or removes one cube, so the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of cubes in the tower changes with each move. To end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, the number of moves that add a cube must differ from the number of moves that remove a cube by an even number (specifically, `n - m`).

The program correctly implements this logic:
- It checks if `n == m` and prints 'YES' if true.
- It checks if `n < m` and prints 'NO' if true.
- It checks if `n > m` and the parities of `n` and `m` are the same (both even or both odd) and prints 'Yes' if true.
- Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The output is case-insensitive, so 'YES', 'Yes', and 'yes' are all acceptable, which the program respects.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.
