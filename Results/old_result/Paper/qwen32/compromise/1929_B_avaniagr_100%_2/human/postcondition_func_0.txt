The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the size of a square grid and an integer `k` representing the minimum number of diagonals that should contain at least one colored cell. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to satisfy the condition on `k` diagonals.
