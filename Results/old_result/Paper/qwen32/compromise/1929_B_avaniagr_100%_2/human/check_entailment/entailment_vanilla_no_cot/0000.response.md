Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of cells that need to be colored for all possible values of `k`. The logic used in the program is incorrect for certain ranges of `k`, particularly when `k` is close to `4n - 2`.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the distribution of diagonals in the grid:

1. There are `n` diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right (let's call these main diagonals).
2. There are `n` diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left (let's call these anti-diagonals).
3. The total number of diagonals is `4n - 2`.

The strategy to color the minimum number of cells to cover at least `k` diagonals involves coloring cells in such a way that we maximize the number of diagonals covered by each cell. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

- For the first `n` diagonals, we can color one cell on each of the main diagonals to cover all of them. This takes `n` cells.
- For the next `n-2` diagonals, we can color one cell on each of the anti-diagonals (excluding the two that overlap with the main diagonals already covered). This takes `n-2` cells.
- For the remaining diagonals, we need to color additional cells. Each additional cell can cover at most 2 diagonals.

Let's correct the program based on this logic:

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k <= n:
            print(k)  # Each cell on the main diagonal covers a unique diagonal
        elif k <= 2 * n - 2:
            print(n + k - n)  # Cover main diagonals and additional diagonals with anti-diagonals
        else:
            remaining_diagonals = k - (2 * n - 2)
            additional_cells = math.ceil(remaining_diagonals / 2)
            print(n + (n - 2) + additional_cells)  # Cover main, anti-diagonals, and remaining diagonals

import math
func()
```

This corrected program should handle all cases correctly based on the described strategy.
