To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head: `i`, `char`, and `password`.

Given the for loop statement:
```python
for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will iterate over each character in the `password` string, using `i` as the index and `char` as the character at that index.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **`password`**: The loop will execute if `password` has at least one character. Since `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters where \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), the condition is already satisfied as long as `password` is not an empty string.

2. **`i`**: The variable `i` is the index that will be used to iterate over `password`. Before the loop starts, `i` is not explicitly defined, but it will be set to 0 during the first iteration of the loop. Therefore, there's no need to adjust `i` before the loop starts.

3. **`char`**: The variable `char` will hold the character at the current index `i` in the `password` string. Before the loop starts, `char` is not explicitly defined, but it will be set to the first character of `password` during the first iteration of the loop. Therefore, there's no need to adjust `char` before the loop starts.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be ensured is that `password` is not an empty string. Given the problem statement, `password` is guaranteed to have at least one character. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\); `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` string; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` string; `last_digit_index` is -1**.

Since no specific adjustments are needed for the loop to execute, the state remains as given.
