To calculate the new value of `z`, we use the given expression `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`. Let's break it down:

- The initial value of `z` is 4.
- `k` is 5, so `k - 1` equals 4.
- `z // (k - 1)` is `4 // 4`, which equals 1.
- Therefore, `z += 1 + 1`, so `z += 2`.
- The new value of `z` is `4 + 2`, which equals 6.

The values of the other variables (`s`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is "5 6 7", `k` is 5, `x` is 6, `a` is 7, `z` is 6, `i` is 3**.
