To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `i` and the range it iterates over, `x - k + 3`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a string containing three space-separated integers.
- `k` is the first integer from `s`.
- `x` is the second integer from `s` and `x >= k`.
- `a` is the third integer from `s`.
- `z` is `k - 1`.

The loop is defined as:
```
for i in range(x - k + 3):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_end`. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end + 1`.

Since we do not have the exact value of `i_end`, we can express the state in terms of the loop variable `i` as follows:
- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

The range `x - k + 3` remains constant for the loop, and no other variables in the loop head need adjustment.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`s` is a string containing three space-separated integers, `k` is the first integer from `s`, `x` is the second integer from `s` and `x >= k`, `a` is the third integer from `s`, `z` is `k - 1`, `i` is one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we need to provide a concrete state, let's assume `i` was `0` at the start of the previous iteration, making `i_end` `0` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `1`.

State: **`s` is a string containing three space-separated integers, `k` is the first integer from `s`, `x` is the second integer from `s` and `x >= k`, `a` is the third integer from `s`, `z` is `k - 1`, `i` is 1**.
