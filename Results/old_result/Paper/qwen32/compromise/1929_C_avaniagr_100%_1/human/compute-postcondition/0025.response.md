Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `s` is a string containing three space-separated integers.
- `k` is the first integer from `s`.
- `x` is the second integer from `s` and `x >= k`.
- `a` is the third integer from `s`.
- `z` is calculated as `2x - k + 3`.
- `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables `s`, `k`, `x`, `a`, or `z`. The string `'YES'` is directly printed to the console.

### Output:
The code will print the string `'YES'`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **YES**
