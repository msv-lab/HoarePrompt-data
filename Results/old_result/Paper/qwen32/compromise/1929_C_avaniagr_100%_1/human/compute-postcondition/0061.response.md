Postcondition: **`s` is the next line from the input file, which is a string containing three space-separated integers; `k`, `x`, and `a` are the integers derived from splitting and converting `s`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, the condition `a >= x + 2` holds true. Otherwise, the condition `a < x + 2` holds true.**
