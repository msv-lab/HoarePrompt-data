In the given task, we are provided with an initial state that includes the values and relationships between several variables: `s`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `z`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is independent of these variables as it directly prints the string `'NO'`.

Let's break down the given information:

- `s` is the string `"5 6 7"`.
- `k` is the integer `5`.
- `x` is the integer `6`.
- `a` is the integer `7`.
- `z` is the integer `11`.
- The condition `a < z` is true since `7 < 11`.

Despite these variable definitions and the condition, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply outputs the string `'NO'` without referencing any of the defined variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
