The `print('YES')` statement in the provided Python code snippet will output the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `s`, `k`, `x`, and `a` as defined in the initial state. The conditions given about the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` do not affect the execution of this specific print statement.

Here's the breakdown:
- `s` is a string containing three space-separated integers.
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are extracted from `s` as the first, second, and third integers respectively.
- The conditions `x < k - 1` and `a >= x + 1` are provided but do not influence the `print('YES')` statement.

Since the `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions, it will simply print 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
