Postcondition: **`s` is a string containing three space-separated integers; `k` is the first integer from `s`, `x` is the second integer from `s`, `a` is the third integer from `s`. If `x == k - 1`, the condition in the if part is satisfied, and the values of `s`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `s` becomes "5 6 7", `k` becomes 5, `x` becomes 6, `a` becomes 7, and `z` is set to 11, with `a` either being greater than or equal to `z` or less than `z`.**
