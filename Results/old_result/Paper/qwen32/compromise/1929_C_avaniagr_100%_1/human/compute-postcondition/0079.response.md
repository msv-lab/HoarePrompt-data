Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of three integers: `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it determines whether `a` meets or exceeds a certain threshold based on the values of `k` and `x`, and prints "YES" if the condition is met or "NO" otherwise.**
