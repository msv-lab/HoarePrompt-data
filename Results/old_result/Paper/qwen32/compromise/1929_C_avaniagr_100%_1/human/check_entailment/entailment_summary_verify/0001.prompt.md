You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (k, x, a) = map(int, s.split())
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 2:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = k - 2
            for i in range(x - k + 3):
                z += z // (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of three integers: `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it determines whether `a` meets or exceeds a certain threshold based on the values of `k` and `x`, and prints "YES" if the condition is met or "NO" otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, we need to carefully analyze the problem description and the logic implemented in the code.

### Problem Analysis

The problem revolves around Sasha's ability to guarantee that he can achieve any number of coins `n` given the rules of the casino:

- If Sasha wins, he receives `y * k` coins, meaning his coins increase by `y * (k - 1)`.
- If Sasha loses, he loses the entire bet amount `y` coins.
- He cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
- Initially, Sasha has `a` coins.

The goal is to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins `n` through a series of bets, given `k`, `x`, and `a`.

### Key Observations

1. **No Consecutive Losses (`x < k - 1`)**:
   - If Sasha can only lose `x` times in a row and `x < k - 1`, he needs a minimum of `x + 1` coins to ensure he can recover from the maximum number of consecutive losses.
   - This is because after `x` losses, he would have `a - (1 + 2 + ... + x)`, and he needs to have enough coins left to bet at least `1` coin again.

2. **Exact Consecutive Losses (`x == k - 1`)**:
   - If Sasha can lose exactly `k - 1` times in a row, he needs a minimum of `x + 2` coins.
   - This is because after `k - 1` losses, he would have `a - (1 + 2 + ... + (k - 1))`, and he needs to have enough coins left to bet at least `1` coin again to start recovering.

3. **More Than Consecutive Losses (`x > k - 1`)**:
   - If Sasha can lose more than `k - 1` times in a row, the strategy becomes more complex.
   - The code calculates a threshold `z` which represents the minimum number of coins needed to guarantee that Sasha can recover from any sequence of losses up to `x` times in a row.
   - The calculation involves simulating the worst-case scenario of consecutive losses and the recovery process.
   - If Sasha has at least `z` coins, he can guarantee achieving any number of coins `n`.

### Code Analysis

Let's break down the code logic:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The code reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Decision Making**:
   - If `x < k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 1`.
   - If `x == k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 2`.
   - If `x > k - 1`, it calculates a threshold `z` and checks if `a >= z`.

3. **Threshold Calculation (`x > k - 1`)**:
   - The code initializes `z = k - 2`.
   - It then iterates `x - k + 3` times, updating `z` to `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`.
   - This loop simulates the worst-case scenario of consecutive losses and the recovery process.

### Conclusion

The code correctly implements the logic described above. It handles all three cases (`x < k - 1`, `x == k - 1`, and `x > k - 1`) and calculates the necessary threshold `z` correctly for the third case.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
