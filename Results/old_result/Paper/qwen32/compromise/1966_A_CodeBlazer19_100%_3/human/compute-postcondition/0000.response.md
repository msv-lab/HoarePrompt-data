The value of `t` is reassigned to the integer value obtained from the input. The preconditions for `n`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged as they have not been affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 2 <= k <= 100, c is a list of n integers where each integer c_i satisfies 1 <= c_i <= 100.**
