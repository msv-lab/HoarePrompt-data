The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variables `n`, `k`, and `c` are not part of the loop head and therefore should not be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given that the loop body is omitted, we only need to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute. The initial state of `i` does not need to be adjusted because it is set by the `range` function in the loop head.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not adjusted as it is set by the loop, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 2 <= k <= 100, c is a list of n integers where each integer c_i satisfies 1 <= c_i <= 100**
