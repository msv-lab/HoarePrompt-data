The `print(-1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The value `-1` is explicitly given in the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about various variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `same`, `num`, `minn`, `_`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the value `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
