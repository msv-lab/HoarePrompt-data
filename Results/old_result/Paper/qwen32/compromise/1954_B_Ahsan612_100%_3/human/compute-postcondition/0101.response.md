The code `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Given the initial state, `minn` can be either `inf` or `1`, and `same` can be `2` or `1`. 

- If `minn` is `inf` and `same` is `2`, `minn` will be updated to `2`.
- If `minn` is `inf` and `same` is `1`, `minn` will be updated to `1`.
- If `minn` is `1` and `same` is `2`, `minn` will remain `1`.
- If `minn` is `1` and `same` is `1`, `minn` will remain `1`.

Therefore, after executing the code, `minn` will be the minimum of its initial value and `same`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input with at least 4 elements, `_` is `k + 1`, `i` is 3 or 4, `same` is 2 or 1, `minn` is the minimum of its initial value and `same`, `num` is `ar[3]` or `ar[4]`.**
