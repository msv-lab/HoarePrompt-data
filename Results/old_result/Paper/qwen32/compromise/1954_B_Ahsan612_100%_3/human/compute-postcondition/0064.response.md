Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is either 3 or 4 or 5. If `ar[i]` equals `num`, `same` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `num` is set to `ar[3]` if `i` is 3, or `ar[4]` if `i` is 4, `minn` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `same`, and `same` is reset to 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was initially 2, it becomes 3; if `i` was initially 3, it becomes 4; and if `i` was initially 4, it becomes 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
