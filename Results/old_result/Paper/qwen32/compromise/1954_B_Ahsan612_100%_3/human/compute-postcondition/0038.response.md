To determine what will be printed by the `print(minn)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and understand the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers.
- `i` is the length of the list `ar`.
- `same` is the count of the last consecutive elements in `ar` that were equal.
- `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`.
- `num` is the last unique element in `ar`.
- `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to `len(ar)`.

### Understanding the Variables:
- `ar` is a list of integers, and we do not know its exact contents.
- `same` counts the number of consecutive equal elements at the end of the list `ar`.
- `minn` holds the minimum value between its previous value and `same`. Since `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to `len(ar)`, it must be a finite value that is less than the length of the list `ar`.
- `num` is the last unique element in `ar`, but it is not directly relevant to the `minn` variable.

### Determining the Output:
Given that `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`, and it is neither `inf` nor equal to `len(ar)`, the printed value of `minn` will be a finite integer that is less than the length of the list `ar`.

Since the exact contents of `ar` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `minn`. However, we can describe its value based on the given conditions.

### Final Answer:
Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum value between its previous value and the count of the last consecutive equal elements in the list `ar`, and minn is a finite integer less than the length of the list `ar`)**
