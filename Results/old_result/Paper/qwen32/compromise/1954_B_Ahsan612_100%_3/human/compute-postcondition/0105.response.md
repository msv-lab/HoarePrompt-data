To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop: `i < len(ar)`. This means that for the loop to execute again, the value of `i` must be less than the length of the list `ar`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers read from input with at least 4 elements
- `_` is `k + 1`
- If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 3, `same` is 3, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is 4 or 5, `same` is 1, `minn` is the minimum of its initial value and `same`, and `num` is `ar[3]` or `ar[4]`

We need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(ar)` for the loop to execute again. Since `ar` has at least 4 elements, the possible values for `i` after the previous iteration are 3, 4, or 5. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

Let's analyze the possible values of `i`:
- If `i` is 3, the loop can execute again if `len(ar) > 3`, which is true since `ar` has at least 4 elements.
- If `i` is 4, the loop can execute again if `len(ar) > 4`.
- If `i` is 5, the loop can execute again if `len(ar) > 5`.

To ensure the loop can certainly execute one more time, we need to adjust the state so that `i` is less than `len(ar)`. Since `ar` has at least 4 elements, the smallest possible length of `ar` is 4. To be certain the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` to be less than the smallest possible length of `ar` that allows for another iteration. Therefore, we should set `i` to 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input with at least 4 elements, `_` is `k + 1`, `i` is 3, `same` is 3, `minn` is `inf`, and `num` is `ar[3]`**
