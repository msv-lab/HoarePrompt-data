The `while` loop condition is `i < len(ar)`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the variable `i` must be less than the length of the list `ar`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers with at least two elements.
- The state of `i` can be either 2 or 3, depending on the previous iteration's condition.

To make sure the loop can execute one more time:
- If `i` is 2, then `i < len(ar)` should still hold true. Since `ar` has at least two elements, `len(ar)` is at least 2, and `i` being 2 means the loop can execute one more time if `len(ar)` is greater than 2.
- If `i` is 3, then `i < len(ar)` should still hold true. Since `ar` has at least two elements, `len(ar)` being 3 or more will ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

Therefore, to guarantee that the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `len(ar)` is at least 3. No other state needs to be adjusted since the question specifies that we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only `i` and `len(ar)` (implied by `ar`).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is either 2 or 3**
