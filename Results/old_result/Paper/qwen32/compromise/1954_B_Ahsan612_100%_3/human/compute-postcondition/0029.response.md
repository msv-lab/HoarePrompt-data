The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Given the initial state, `minn` is initially 1. The value of `same` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether `ar[2]` is equal to `num` or not. Since `minn` is already 1, and the minimum of 1 and either 2 or 3 is always 1, `minn` remains 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, `minn` is 1, `same` is 3 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num` and 2 otherwise, and `i` is either 4 or 5; `num` is `ar[4]` if `i` is 4, or `ar[5]` if `i` is 5.**
