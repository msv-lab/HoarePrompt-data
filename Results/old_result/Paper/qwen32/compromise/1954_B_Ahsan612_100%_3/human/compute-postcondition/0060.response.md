The code assigns the value of the element at index `i` in the list `ar` to the variable `num`. Since `i` is either 3 or 4, `num` will take the value of `ar[3]` or `ar[4]` respectively. The values of `t`, `n`, and `ar` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is either 3 or 4, and `num` is `ar[3]` if `i` is 3, or `ar[4]` if `i` is 4.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is either 3 or 4, `num` is `ar[3]` if `i` is 3, or `ar[4]` if `i` is 4.**
