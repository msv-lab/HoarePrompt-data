The provided code snippet only includes the line `n = int(input())`. This line reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `n` is now assigned the value of the integer input provided by the user. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical elements, `num` is the last unique element encountered in the list, and `minn` is the minimum count of any sequence of identical elements encountered in the list, updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `same`. If `minn` was initially `inf` or equal to `len(ar)`, it retains its value; otherwise, `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`. `_` is `k + 1`.**
