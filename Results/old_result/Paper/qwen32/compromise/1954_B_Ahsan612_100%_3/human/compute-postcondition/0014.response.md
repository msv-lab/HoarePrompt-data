The code snippet provided is `same = 1`, which reassigns the variable `same` to the value 1. This operation does not affect any other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 2, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**
