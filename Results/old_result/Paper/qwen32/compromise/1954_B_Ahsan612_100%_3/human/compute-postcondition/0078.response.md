Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. `ar` is a list of integers.
4. `i` is `len(ar)`.
5. `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical elements.
6. `num` is the last unique element encountered in the list.
7. `minn` is the minimum count of any sequence of identical elements encountered in the list, updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `same`.
8. `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.

### Analysis:
- The variable `minn` is initialized to keep track of the minimum count of any sequence of identical elements in the list `ar`.
- `same` keeps track of the count of the last sequence of identical elements in the list.
- `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `same`, ensuring it always holds the smallest count of any sequence of identical elements seen so far.
- The precondition specifies that `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`, which means it has been properly initialized and updated based on the list `ar`.

### Output Determination:
Since `minn` is the minimum count of any sequence of identical elements in the list `ar` and it has been updated accordingly, the `print(minn)` statement will output the value of `minn`.

### Final Output:
Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum count of any sequence of identical elements in the list `ar`)**
