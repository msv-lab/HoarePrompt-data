To determine what will be printed by the `print(minn)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state step by step.

1. **Variables and their descriptions:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 10,000 (inclusive).
   - `n`: An input integer.
   - `ar`: A list of integers read from input.
   - `i`: The length of the list `ar`.
   - `same`: The count of the last sequence of consecutive elements.
   - `num`: The last unique element encountered in the list.
   - `minn`: The minimum of its current value and `same`. This variable is neither `inf` (infinity) nor equal to the length of `ar`.
   - `_`: `k + 1`. This variable does not appear to be used in the `print(minn)` statement, so we can ignore it for this task.

2. **Understanding `minn`:**
   - `minn` is calculated as the minimum between its current value and `same`. This implies that `minn` is being updated throughout the program, but at the point where `print(minn)` is executed, it holds the smallest value it has encountered during its updates relative to `same`.

3. **What is printed:**
   - The `print(minn)` statement will output the value of `minn` at the time it is executed. Since `minn` is the minimum of its current value and `same`, and it is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`, it will print a specific integer value that has been determined by the logic of the program up to that point.

Given that the exact values of `ar`, `same`, and the entire state of the program leading up to the `print(minn)` statement are not explicitly provided, we can only describe `minn` in terms of the constraints and logic given.

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum value between its current value and the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements in the list `ar`, and it is neither infinity nor equal to the length of `ar`)**
