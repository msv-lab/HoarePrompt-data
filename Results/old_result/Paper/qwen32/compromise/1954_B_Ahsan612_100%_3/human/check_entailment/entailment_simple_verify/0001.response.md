Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated version to ensure the correctness of the original assessment. We'll check if the program correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful or outputs -1 if it's impossible.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `ar`.

2. **Identifying Segments:**
   - The program initializes `same` to 1, indicating the length of the current segment of identical elements.
   - It initializes `num` to the first element of the array and `minn` to infinity, which will store the minimum size of any segment of identical elements.
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element is different, it updates `minn` to be the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
   - After the loop, it performs a final check to update `minn` with the last segment length.

3. **Decision Making:**
   - If `minn` remains infinity (which should not happen as it's initialized to the first segment length) or if `minn` equals the length of the array (meaning all elements are the same), the program outputs -1.
   - Otherwise, it outputs `minn`.

### Reasoning

- **Correctness of Identifying Segments:**
  - The program correctly identifies segments of identical elements and tracks the minimum segment length.

- **Correctness of Decision Making:**
  - If all elements are the same (`minn == len(ar)`), the array is already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements, so outputting -1 is correct.
  - If `minn` is less than the length of the array, removing the entire segment of minimum length would make the array non-beautiful, so outputting `minn` is correct.

### Validation Using Annotations

Let's validate the program using the provided annotations and examples.

#### Example 1
```
Input:
3
2 2 2

Output:
-1
```
- The array is `[2, 2, 2]`.
- The program identifies a single segment of length 3.
- `minn` is 3, which equals the length of the array.
- The program correctly outputs -1.

#### Example 2
```
Input:
5
1 2 1 2 1

Output:
1
```
- The array is `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`.
- The program identifies segments of lengths 1, 1, 1, 1.
- `minn` is 1.
- The program correctly outputs 1.

#### Example 3
```
Input:
1
1

Output:
-1
```
- The array is `[1]`.
- The program identifies a single segment of length 1.
- `minn` is 1, which equals the length of the array.
- The program correctly outputs -1.

#### Example 4
```
Input:
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output:
3
```
- The array is `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`.
- The program identifies segments of lengths 3, 1, 3.
- `minn` is 1.
- The program correctly outputs 3.

### Conclusion

The program correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful or outputs -1 if it's impossible. The annotations and examples support the correctness of the program.

**Final: True**
