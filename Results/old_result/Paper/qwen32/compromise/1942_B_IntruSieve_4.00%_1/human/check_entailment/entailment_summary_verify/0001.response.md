### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem description to determine if the code correctly constructs the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \).

The problem states that the array \( a \) is constructed such that:
\[ a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]

Where \(\texttt{MEX}\) is the minimum non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is an empty list that will store the elements of the permutation \( p \).
   - `minn` and `maxx` are initialized to 0. `minn` is supposed to keep track of the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation, and `maxx` is supposed to keep track of the maximum value encountered in the `mex` list.

2. **Processing each element of `arr`**:
   - If `arr[i]` is positive, the code appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. If `minn` equals `maxx`, it increments `minn` again. This logic is flawed because it doesn't correctly determine the MEX value.
   - If `arr[i]` is non-positive, the code appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`. It also updates `maxx` if the newly appended value is greater than `maxx`. This part is also flawed because it doesn't correctly determine the MEX value.

### Flaws in the Code:
- The logic for determining the MEX value is incorrect. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of the permutation, but the code does not correctly maintain this value.
- The handling of positive and non-positive values in `arr` does not correctly reflect the relationship between `a_i` and the MEX of the prefix of `p`.

### Correct Approach:
- For each element in `arr`, determine the MEX of the current prefix of `p` and use it to compute the next element of `p`.
- Maintain a set or a boolean array to efficiently determine the MEX value.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's take the first test case from the example:
```
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

- **Step 1**: \( a_1 = 1 \)
  - \(\texttt{MEX}(\emptyset) = 0\)
  - \( p_1 = 0 \) (since \( a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(\emptyset) - p_1 \))
- **Step 2**: \( a_2 = 1 \)
  - \(\texttt{MEX}(0) = 1\)
  - \( p_2 = 1 \) (since \( a_2 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - p_2 \))
- **Step 3**: \( a_3 = -2 \)
  - \(\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) = 2\)
  - \( p_3 = 4 \) (since \( a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - p_3 \))
- **Step 4**: \( a_4 = 1 \)
  - \(\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) = 2\)
  - \( p_4 = 2 \) (since \( a_4 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - p_4 \))
- **Step 5**: \( a_5 = 2 \)
  - \(\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) = 3\)
  - \( p_5 = 3 \) (since \( a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - p_5 \))

The correct permutation for this test case is \( [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] \).

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \). Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
