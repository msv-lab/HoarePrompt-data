Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The task is to construct a permutation `p` based on the array `a` where each `a_i` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The program attempts to reconstruct the permutation `p` from the array `a`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is an empty list which will store the permutation `p`.
   - `minn` is initialized to 0. This variable is intended to keep track of the smallest non-negative integer not yet included in `p`.
   - `maxx` is initialized to 0. This variable is intended to keep track of the largest value encountered in `mex`.

2. **Iteration through array `a`**:
   - For each element in `a`, the program checks if the element is positive.
     - If `a[i]` is positive, the program appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn` by 1. If `minn` becomes equal to `maxx`, `minn` is incremented again to ensure it is the smallest non-negative integer not yet included in `mex`.
     - If `a[i]` is not positive (i.e., it is zero or negative), the program appends `abs(a[i] - minn)` to `mex`. If the absolute value of `a[i] - minn` is greater than `maxx`, `maxx` is updated.
   
3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed permutation `p` (stored in `mex`).

### Issues with the Program:
- The logic for determining `minn` and `maxx` and appending to `mex` does not correctly reflect the definition of `MEX` and how `p` should be constructed.
- The program does not correctly handle the case when `a[i]` is negative or zero, leading to incorrect values being appended to `mex`.
- The use of `maxx` is unnecessary and does not contribute to the correct construction of `p`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Use a set to keep track of the numbers already included in `p`.
- For each `a[i]`, calculate the `MEX` of the current `p` and determine `p[i]` as `MEX + a[i]`.
- Ensure that `p[i]` is not already in the set of included numbers and that it is a valid non-negative integer less than `n`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not properly implement the logic for constructing the permutation `p` based on the array `a`.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **False**
