The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `arr`. This means that `arr` will now hold the values of the integers provided in the input, replacing any previous value it might have had.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer input; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ a_i ≤ n; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the input.**
