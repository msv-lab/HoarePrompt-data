The provided Python code snippet contains an empty `print()` statement, which means it will print nothing to the console. The `print()` function without any arguments simply outputs a newline character.

Given the initial state description, we have:
- `mex` is a list of integers.
- `minn` is the final value of `minn` after some loop (not provided in the snippet).
- `maxx` is the maximum value of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` encountered for non-positive `arr[i]` values (also not directly used in the provided snippet).

Since the `print()` statement is empty, none of these variables (`mex`, `minn`, `maxx`) are being printed. The output will be just a newline.

Output: **(newline)**
