You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        print(a)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the second line contains a list of n integers a_i where each a_i is either 0 or 1. There is at least one a_i equal to 1 in each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:

        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers with leading and trailing zeros removed from the last iteration's input; `res` is the total number of `0`s in the list `a` from the last iteration's input.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single contiguous block, without any free cells between them. The operations allowed are moving a chip to the closest free cell to the left.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of cells) and the list `a` representing the cells (0 for free, 1 for chip).

2. **Trimming Leading and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` using `pop(0)` and `pop()`. This step is correct because these free cells at the ends do not affect the minimum number of operations needed to group the chips together.

3. **Counting Operations:**
   - The program then counts the number of zeros in the trimmed list `a`. Each zero represents a free cell that needs to be filled by a chip from the right, which means an operation is needed for each zero.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the count of zeros as the result for each test case.

### Correctness Check:
- **Trimming the List:** The removal of leading and trailing zeros is correct because these free cells do not need to be considered in the process of forming a contiguous block of chips.
- **Counting Operations:** The number of operations needed is indeed the number of zeros in the trimmed list. Each zero represents a free cell that needs to be filled by a chip from the right, which requires an operation.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's verify the program with the first example from the problem statement:
- Input: `8`, `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
- After trimming, the list becomes `1 1 1 0 1 1`.
- The number of zeros in the trimmed list is `1`, which matches the expected output.

The program seems to correctly compute the minimum number of operations for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
