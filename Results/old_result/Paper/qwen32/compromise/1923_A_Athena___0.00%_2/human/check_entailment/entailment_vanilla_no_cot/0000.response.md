Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. The program simply counts the number of free cells between the first and last chip, but it does not account for the fact that chips can only move to the closest free cell to their left, which might not always be the most efficient path to form a contiguous block.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. The program removes leading and trailing zeros (free cells) from the list, which is correct, but it does not solve the problem of finding the minimum number of moves to form a contiguous block.
2. The program counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip as the result, but this does not reflect the actual number of moves required. For example, if chips are at positions 1, 4, and 6, and there are free cells at positions 2, 3, and 5, the program will count 3 free cells, but it might only take 2 moves to bring the chips together (move the chip from 6 to 5, then move the chip from 4 to 3).

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to implement a strategy that considers the optimal sequence of moves to bring all chips together with the least number of operations.
