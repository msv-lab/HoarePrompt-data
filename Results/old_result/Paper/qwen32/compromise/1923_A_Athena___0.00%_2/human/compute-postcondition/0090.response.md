Output State: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `i` is `i + 2`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `res` is `res + 1`**

In natural language, this means that the list `a` still has at least one element, the value of `i` is still `i + 2`, the value of `t` has not changed, `n` remains the input integer, and the value of `res` has been incremented by 1.
