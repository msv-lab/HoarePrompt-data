The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `t` and `n` are not modified by this code.

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and `n` is an input integer. After the code execution, `a` will be a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
