To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `a and a[-1] == 0`.

1. The condition `a` checks if the list `a` is not empty.
2. The condition `a[-1] == 0` checks if the last element of the list `a` is 0.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `a` is a list with the last element removed, we need to ensure that the list `a` is not empty and that its last element is 0 for the loop to execute again.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

- Since the last element was removed, we need to add an element back to `a` so that it is not empty.
- The added element must be `0` to satisfy the condition `a[-1] == 0`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to add `0` to the list `a`.

State: **`a` is a list with the last element removed and `0` is added to `a`**
