Output State: **`a` is a list with all trailing zeros removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `res` is 0, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, all the zeros at the end of the list `a` are removed. The variable `i` is updated to be the index of the last element in the modified list `a`. The variables `res`, `t`, and `n` remain the same as they were initially.
