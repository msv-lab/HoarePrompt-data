Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, and `b - a + 1 > 1`. Additionally, `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` if `a` is at least 2, otherwise `s` is `p[b - 1]`. The current value of `s` is such that `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`**
