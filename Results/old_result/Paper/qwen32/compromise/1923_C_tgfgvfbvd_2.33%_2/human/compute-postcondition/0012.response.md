Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are the two integers provided by the user input; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must contain at least one integer; `x` is the next element in the list `l`; `c` is increased by the value of `x`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `c` is now the sum of its previous value and the value of `x`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, and `x`) retain their original values.
