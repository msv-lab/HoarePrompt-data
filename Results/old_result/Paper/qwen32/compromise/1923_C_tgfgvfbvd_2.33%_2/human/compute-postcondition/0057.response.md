To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the behavior of the loop:

- The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `l`.
- For each iteration, it adds the current element `x` to the cumulative sum `c`.
- It then appends the updated cumulative sum `c` to the list `p`.

After all iterations, the list `p` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in `l` up to each point in the list. Specifically, `p[i]` will be the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `l`.

Here is the final output state described:

- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` remain as integers provided by the user input.
- `l` remains the list of integers provided by the user input.
- `p` will be a list where each element `p[i]` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `l`.
- `c` will be the total sum of all elements in `l`.

Thus, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `p` will have the cumulative sums of the list `l`, and `c` will have the sum of all elements in `l`.
