Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m - 1` are integers provided by the user input where `m - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l`.
- `a` and `b` are integers provided by the latest user input.
- If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`.
- There is a condition that checks if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`. If this condition holds true, the code prints 'YES'.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet simply prints the string `'YES'`. This means regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, or `s`, the output will always be `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
