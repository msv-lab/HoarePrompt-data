To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each element in the list `l`. The loop iterates over each element `x` in `l`, adds it to the cumulative sum `c`, and appends the updated `c` to the list `p`.

Let's break down the process step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` and `m` are integers with `m > 0`.
   - `l` is a list of integers.
   - `p` is an initially empty list.
   - `c` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each element `x` in `l`, the following operations are performed:
     - `c += x`: The current element `x` is added to `c`.
     - `p.append(c)`: The updated value of `c` is appended to the list `p`.

After all elements in `l` have been processed, the final state of the variables will be:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `l` remains unchanged as it is only read from, not modified.
- `p` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` will hold the sum of all elements in `l`.

### Final Output State

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input where `m` must be greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.

Using the specified format:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `p` will have the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, and `c` will be the total sum of all elements in `l`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
