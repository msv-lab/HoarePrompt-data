The code snippet subtracts the cumulative sum up to the `(a-2)`-th element of the list `l` (which is stored in `p[a-2]`) from the cumulative sum up to the `b`-th element of the list `l` (which is stored in `s`). This operation updates the value of `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input where `m` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`
- `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input
- `s` is the cumulative sum up to the `b`-th element of the list `l`
- `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0

After executing the line `s -= p[a - 2]`, the value of `s` is updated to be the difference between the cumulative sum up to the `b`-th element and the cumulative sum up to the `(a-2)`-th element.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input where `m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input; `s` is the cumulative sum from the `a-1`-th element to the `b`-th element of the list `l`.**
