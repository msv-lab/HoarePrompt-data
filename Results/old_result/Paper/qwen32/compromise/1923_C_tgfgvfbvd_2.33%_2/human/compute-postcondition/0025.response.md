Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input where `m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input. If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is the cumulative sum from the `a-1`-th element to the `b`-th element of the list `l`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` holds true. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s < 2 * (b - a + 1)` holds true.**
