The code snippet appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Given that `c` is defined as `l[1] + l[2]`, the list `p` will now include this new element.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least 2 integers
- `p` is a list containing `[0, l[1]]`
- `c` is `l[1] + l[2]`
- `x` is the next element in the list `l` after the current `x`

After executing `p.append(c)`, the list `p` will be updated to `[0, l[1], l[1] + l[2]]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least 2 integers; `p` is a list containing `[0, l[1], l[1] + l[2]]`; `c` is `l[1] + l[2]`; `x` is the next element in the list `l` after the current `x`.**
