The code appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Given that `c` is initially set to `l[1]`, after the operation, `p` will contain two elements: the initial `0` and the value of `l[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least 1 integer, `p` is a list containing [0, `l[1]`], `c` is `l[1]`, `x` is `l[1]`**.
