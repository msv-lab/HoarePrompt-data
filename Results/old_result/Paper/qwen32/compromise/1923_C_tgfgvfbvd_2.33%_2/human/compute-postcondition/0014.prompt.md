Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are the two integers provided by the user input; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `p` is an empty list; `c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in l:
    c += x
    p.append(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are the two integers provided by the user input; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must contain at least one integer; `p` is a list containing the single element `n`; `c` is `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are the two integers provided by the user input; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must contain at least one integer; `p` is a list containing the elements `n` and `n + x`; `c` is `n + x`; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are the two integers provided by the user input; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must contain at least one integer; `x` is the next element in the list `l`; `c` is increased by the value of `x`; `p` contains the new element `c`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
