The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and `s`) but none of these variables are used within the provided code snippet. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t`: An integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `n` and `m`: Integers provided by user input with the constraint that `m` must be greater than 0.
- `l`: A list of integers provided by user input.
- `p`: A list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c`: The total sum of all elements in `l`.
- `a` and `b`: Integers provided by user input.
- `s`: Calculated based on the values of `a`, `b`, and the list `p`.

Despite the detailed definitions of these variables, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
