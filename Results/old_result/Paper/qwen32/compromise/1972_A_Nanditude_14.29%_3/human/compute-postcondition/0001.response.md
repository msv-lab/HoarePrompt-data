Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of lists representing test cases. Each sublist contains three elements: an integer `n`, a list `a` of length `n`, and a list `b` of length `n`. The function returns the list `arr` sorted in reverse lexicographical order, treating each sublist as a single element.**
