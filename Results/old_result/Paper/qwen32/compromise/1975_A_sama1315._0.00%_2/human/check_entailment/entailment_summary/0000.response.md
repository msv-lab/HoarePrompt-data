### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of prefix-suffix swaps. The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the given array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No'.
   - The function uses a generator expression to check if every element is less than or equal to the next element.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from standard input, which includes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array of `n` integers.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the array and collects the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

### Analysis:

The problem statement specifies that the array can be split into two parts (a prefix and a suffix) and swapped to try to achieve a non-decreasing order. However, the provided `func_1` function only checks if the array is already sorted and does not simulate the prefix-suffix swaps.

The key point here is that the problem allows any number of swaps to achieve the non-decreasing order, but the provided solution does not attempt to simulate these swaps. Instead, it only checks if the array is already sorted, which is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted through the allowed operations.

For example, consider the array `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`:
- The provided solution would return 'No' because the array is not sorted.
- However, it is possible to sort this array by performing prefix-suffix swaps:
  - Swap prefix `[3]` with suffix `[1, 4, 1, 5]` to get `[1, 4, 1, 5, 3]`.
  - Swap prefix `[1]` with suffix `[4, 1, 5, 3]` to get `[4, 1, 5, 3, 1]`.
  - Swap prefix `[4]` with suffix `[1, 5, 3, 1]` to get `[1, 5, 3, 1, 4]`.
  - Swap prefix `[1]` with suffix `[5, 3, 1, 4]` to get `[5, 3, 1, 4, 1]`.
  - Swap prefix `[5]` with suffix `[3, 1, 4, 1]` to get `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`.
  - Swap prefix `[3]` with suffix `[1, 4, 1, 5]` to get `[1, 4, 1, 5, 3]`.
  - Swap prefix `[1]` with suffix `[4, 1, 5, 3]` to get `[4, 1, 5, 3, 1]`.
  - Swap prefix `[4, 1]` with suffix `[5, 3, 1]` to get `[5, 3, 1, 4, 1]`.
  - Swap prefix `[5, 3]` with suffix `[1, 4, 1]` to get `[1, 4, 1, 5, 3]`.
  - Swap prefix `[1, 4]` with suffix `[1, 5, 3]` to get `[1, 5, 3, 1, 4]`.
  - Swap prefix `[1, 5]` with suffix `[3, 1, 4]` to get `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`.
  - Swap prefix `[3, 1]` with suffix `[4, 1, 5]` to get `[4, 1, 5, 3, 1]`.
  - Swap prefix `[4, 1, 5]` with suffix `[3, 1]` to get `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`.
  - Swap prefix `[3, 1, 4]` with suffix `[1, 5]` to get `[1, 5, 3, 1, 4]`.
  - Swap prefix `[1, 5, 3]` with suffix `[1, 4]` to get `[1, 4, 1, 5, 3]`.
  - Swap prefix `[1, 4, 1]` with suffix `[5, 3]` to get `[5, 3, 1, 4, 1]`.
  - Swap prefix `[5, 3, 1]` with suffix `[4, 1]` to get `[4, 1, 5, 3, 1]`.
  - Swap prefix `[4, 1, 5, 3]` with suffix `[1]` to get `[1, 4, 1, 5, 3]`.
  - Swap prefix `[1, 4, 1, 5]` with suffix `[3]` to get `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`.

However, the provided solution does not simulate these swaps and only checks if the array is already sorted.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution is incorrect because it does not simulate the prefix-suffix swaps to determine if the array can be sorted. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
