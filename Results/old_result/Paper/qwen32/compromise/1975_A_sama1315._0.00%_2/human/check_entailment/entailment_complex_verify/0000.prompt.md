You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr):
    if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):
        return 'Yes'
    return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of positive integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 50.
def func_1(arr):
    if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)) :
        return 'Yes'
        #The program returns 'Yes'
    #State: `arr` is a list of positive integers with length `n` such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, and there exists at least one pair of consecutive elements in `arr` where the first element is greater than the second element.
    return 'No' if any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)) else 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'No'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of positive integers `arr` with a length between 2 and 50. It returns 'Yes' if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order, and 'No' otherwise.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n positive integers where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and each element in arr is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1

    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])

        index += n
        
        result = func_1(arr)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: `arr` is the last list of integers obtained from `data` in the last iteration; `index` is the position right after the last list of integers in `data`; `results` is a list of results from `func_1(arr)` for each iteration; `t` and `data` remain unchanged.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: result1\nresult2\n...\nresultN (where result1, result2, ..., resultN are the elements of the results list, each separated by a newline character)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` positive integers. It processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the list of integers and collects the results. Finally, it prints the results, each on a new line.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing zero or more operations where an operation consists of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them.
- **Input**:
  - Multiple test cases.
  - Each test case starts with an integer `n` (length of the array).
  - Followed by `n` integers representing the array.
- **Output**:
  - For each test case, output "Yes" if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order using the described operation, otherwise output "No".

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(arr)`: This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order or if it can be sorted by swapping any prefix and suffix.
2. `func_2()`: This function processes multiple test cases by reading input, applying `func_1` to each test case, and printing the results.

#### `func_1(arr)` Analysis:
- The function first checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using a generator expression with `all()`.
- If the array is already sorted, it returns "Yes".
- If the array is not sorted, it checks if there exists any pair of elements where the current element is greater than the next element using a generator expression with `any()`.
- If such a pair exists, it returns "No". Otherwise, it returns "Yes".

#### `func_2()` Analysis:
- This function reads multiple test cases from standard input.
- For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements.
- It then calls `func_1` to determine if the array can be sorted and stores the result.
- Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness of `func_1(arr)`:
The logic in `func_1(arr)` is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that if the array is not sorted, it cannot be sorted by swapping any prefix and suffix. This is not true because the operation allows for more complex rearrangements.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the array `[3, 1, 2]`.
- The array is not sorted in non-decreasing order.
- However, by splitting the array into `x=[3]` and `y=[1, 2]` and swapping them, we get `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for the possibility of sorting the array by more complex rearrangements through prefix and suffix swaps.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The function `func_1(arr)` incorrectly assumes that if the array is not sorted in non-decreasing order, it cannot be sorted by the allowed operation. This is demonstrated by the counterexample `[3, 1, 2]`, which can be sorted by swapping the prefix `[3]` and the suffix `[1, 2]`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
