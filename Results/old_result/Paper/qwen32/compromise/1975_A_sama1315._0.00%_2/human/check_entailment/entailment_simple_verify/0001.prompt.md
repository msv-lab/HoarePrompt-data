You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation any number of times. The operation involves splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and then swapping these two parts.

### Key Observations
1. **Operation Effect**: Swapping a prefix and suffix can only change the order of elements within the array, but it cannot change the relative order of elements within the prefix or within the suffix. Therefore, if the array can be sorted by performing this operation, it must be possible to split the array into two parts such that the suffix is non-decreasing and the prefix is non-decreasing, and the last element of the suffix is less than or equal to the first element of the prefix.
2. **Checking the Condition**: To check if the array can be sorted by the operation, we need to find a point in the array where the sequence can be split into two non-decreasing parts. This means we need to find a point where the array stops increasing, and then continues increasing again.

### Code Analysis
Let's analyze the provided code functions.

#### Function `func_1`
- **Purpose**: This function checks if an array can be sorted into non-decreasing order by the specified operation.
- **Implementation**:
  - It first checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`.
  - If the array is already sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
  - If there is any element that is greater than the next element (`any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`), it returns 'No'.
  - Otherwise, it returns 'Yes' (which is redundant since the previous condition would have already returned 'No' if the array was not sorted).

#### Function `func_2`
- **Purpose**: This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.
- **Implementation**:
  - It reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
  - It iterates over the number of test cases (`t`), reads the size of each array (`n`), reads the array elements, and passes the array to `func_1`.
  - It collects the results for each test case and prints them joined by newlines.

### Correctness Evaluation
- **Function `func_1`**: The function incorrectly assumes that if the array is not already sorted, it cannot be sorted by the operation. This is not true. The operation allows for rearranging the array in a way that could potentially sort it, even if it is not sorted initially. For example, the array `[3, 1, 2]` can be split into `[3]` and `[1, 2]`, swapped to `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted.
- **Function `func_2`**: The function correctly reads and processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to determine the result for each test case.

### Conclusion
The provided code is incorrect because `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by the specified operation. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is not sufficient.

Correctness: **False**
