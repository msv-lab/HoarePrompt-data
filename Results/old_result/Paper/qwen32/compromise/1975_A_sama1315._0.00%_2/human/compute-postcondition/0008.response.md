Given the initial state, let's break down the components and determine what will be printed.

- `arr` is the last list of integers obtained from `data` in the last iteration.
- `index` is the position right after the last list of integers in `data`.
- `results` is a list of results from `func_1(arr)` for each iteration.
- `t` and `data` remain unchanged.

The print statement is:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Explanation:
1. **`results` List**: This list contains the results of calling `func_1(arr)` for each iteration. The exact values within `results` depend on the behavior of `func_1` and the contents of `arr` from each iteration. However, we know that `results` is a list of strings (or values that can be converted to strings) because they are being joined by `'\n'`.

2. **`'\n'.join(results)`**: This expression joins all elements in the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`'\n'`).

### Output:
Since the exact values of `results` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the contents of `results`.

Output: **result1\nresult2\n...\nresultN (where result1, result2, ..., resultN are the elements of the results list, each separated by a newline character)**

This output represents the concatenated string formed by joining all elements of the `results` list with newline characters.
