The code snippet sorts the `temp` list in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The only change is in the `temp` list, which is now sorted.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`.**
