Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a new list of integers derived from the latest input, `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`. If `temp[1]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to `temp[1]`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.**
