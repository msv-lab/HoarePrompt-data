The code snippet `temp.sort()` sorts the list `temp` in ascending order. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `max`, and the indices and values of `a` other than those in `temp` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `max` is 0, `temp` is a sorted sublist of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`.**
