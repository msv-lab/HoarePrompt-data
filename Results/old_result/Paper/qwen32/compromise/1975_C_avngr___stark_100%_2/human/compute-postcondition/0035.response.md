The code snippet `temp = a[i:i + 3]` slices the list `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` and assigns the resulting sublist to the variable `temp`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `max` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `max` is 0, `temp` is a sublist of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`.**
