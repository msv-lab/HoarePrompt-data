Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. The array `a` and its elements `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not yet defined. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(min(a))
        continue
    max = 0
    for i in range(n - 2):
        temp = a[i:i + 3]
        temp.sort()
        if temp[1] > max:
            max = temp[1]
    print(max)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `max` is the maximum second element found in any sorted sublist of `a` of length 3 during the loop execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `max` is the maximum value among the second smallest elements of all possible sublists of length 3 in `a`.

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the integer input by the user, `a` is a new list of integers derived from the latest input, and `max` is the maximum second smallest element found in any slice of length 3 from the list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
