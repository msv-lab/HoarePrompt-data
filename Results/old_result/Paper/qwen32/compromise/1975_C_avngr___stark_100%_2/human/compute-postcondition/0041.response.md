The code snippet `temp = a[i:i + 3]` slices the list `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` (not inclusive) and assigns the result to `temp`. Given that `i` is `i + 1` from the initial state, `i` now holds the value of its previous value plus one. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and the elements of `a`) remain unchanged.

Since `a` is a list of integers and `i` is an index into this list, `temp` will be a sublist of `a` containing up to three elements starting from index `i`. The exact values in `temp` depend on the specific values in `a` starting from index `i`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `temp` is a sublist of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`.**
