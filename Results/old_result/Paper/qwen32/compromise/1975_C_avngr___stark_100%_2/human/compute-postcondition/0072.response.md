The code snippet `temp = a[i:i + 3]` slices the list `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` (not inclusive) and assigns the resulting sublist to the variable `temp`. This operation does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `i`, but it does create a new variable `temp` which holds the sliced sublist.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a new list of integers derived from the latest input, `i` is incremented by 1, `temp` is a sublist of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`**.
