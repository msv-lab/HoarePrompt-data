Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. The array `a` and its elements `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not yet defined. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is the number of test cases. The array `a` and its elements are not yet defined as they are expected to be read in subsequent inputs. The precondition about the sum of `n` over all test cases still holds.
