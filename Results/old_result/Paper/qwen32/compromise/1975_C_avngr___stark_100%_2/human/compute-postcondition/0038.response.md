Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `max` is `temp[1]`, `temp` is a sorted sublist of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, and `temp[1]` is greater than `max`.**

In this output state, the value of `max` has been updated to be equal to `temp[1]`. All other variables retain their previously described states.
