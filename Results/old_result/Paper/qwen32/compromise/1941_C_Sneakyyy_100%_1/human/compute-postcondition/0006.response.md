The code snippet `s = a[i:i + 3]` takes a substring of the string `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 3` (non-inclusive). Given that `i` is 0, `s` will be the first three characters of the string `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string with length greater than 2; `ans` is 0; `i` is 0; `s` is the first three characters of `a`.**
