The value of `i` is incremented by 3. Given that `i` was either 6 or 2 based on the initial conditions, `i` will now be 9 or 5, respectively. The values of `iterations`, `n`, `a`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`iterations` is the value obtained from `int(input())` and must be at least 1; `n` is an integer; `a` is a string with length greater than 8; `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`; if the original `s` was 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 9; otherwise, if the original `s` was not 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 0 and `i` is 5.**
