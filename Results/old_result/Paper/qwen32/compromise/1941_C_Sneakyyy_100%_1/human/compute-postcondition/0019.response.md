To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `len(a)`. The loop condition is `i < len(a) - 2`, so we need to ensure that after the previous iteration, `i` is still less than `len(a) - 2` for the loop to execute again.

Let's break it down:

1. **Variables in the loop head**: `i` and `len(a)`.
2. **Loop condition**: `i < len(a) - 2`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a string with length greater than 5 if the original `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `a` is a string with length greater than 2.
- `s` is the substring `a[i:i + 3]`.
- If the original `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4.
- If the original `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie', then `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
- If `i` is currently 6, then `len(a) - 2` must be greater than 6, meaning `len(a)` must be greater than 8.
- If `i` is currently 4, then `len(a) - 2` must be greater than 4, meaning `len(a)` must be greater than 6.
- If `i` is currently 2, then `len(a) - 2` must be greater than 2, meaning `len(a)` must be greater than 4.

Since the length of `a` is already specified to be greater than 5 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', and greater than 2 otherwise, we need to ensure `len(a)` is adjusted to be greater than the current `i + 2` to satisfy the loop condition.

Given the conditions:
- If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `i` is 6, so `len(a)` must be greater than 8.
- If `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie', and `i` is 4 or 2, `len(a)` must be greater than 6 or 4 respectively, but since `a` is already longer than 5 or 2, we just need to ensure it's long enough for the current `i`.

Therefore, we adjust `len(a)` to be greater than `i + 2` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string with length greater than `i + 2`; `s` is the substring `a[i:i + 3]`. If the original `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4. If the original `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie', then `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2.**
