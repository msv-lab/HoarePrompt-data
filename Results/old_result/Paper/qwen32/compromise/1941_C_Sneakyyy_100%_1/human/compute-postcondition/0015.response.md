The code snippet `i += 3` increments the value of `i` by 3. Given the initial state, if the original `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` was initially 3, and after the increment, `i` becomes 6. If the original `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', then `i` was initially 1, and after the increment, `i` becomes 4. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string with length greater than 5 if the original `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `a` is a string with length greater than 2; `s` is the substring `a[i:i + 3]`; If the original `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 6. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 4.**
