Postcondition: **`iterations` is the value obtained from `int(input())`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value obtained from `input()` and has a length of at least 6, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i+3`. If the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, and `i` is 4 if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 2.**

To simplify and clarify:
- If the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6.
- Otherwise, `ans` is 1 if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie' (which is redundant and should be removed), otherwise `ans` is 0, and `i` is 4 if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie' (which is also redundant), otherwise `i` is 2.

Thus, a more concise postcondition would be:
Postcondition: **`iterations` is the value obtained from `int(input())`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value obtained from `input()` and has a length of at least 6, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i+3`. If the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2.**
