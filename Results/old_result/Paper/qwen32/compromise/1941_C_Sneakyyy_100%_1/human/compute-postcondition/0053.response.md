To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and understand the variables involved:

1. **iterations**: This is the value obtained from `int(input())`. It's an integer input from the user, but its value is not explicitly known from the given precondition.
2. **n**: This is another input integer from the user, but its value is also not explicitly known from the given precondition.
3. **a**: This is the value obtained from `input()`. It's a string input from the user.
4. **ans**: This variable is described as the total count of 'map' and 'pie' substrings in the string `a`.
5. **i**: This is the smallest integer such that `i >= len(a) - 2`. This value is not used in the `print(ans)` statement, so it's not relevant for determining the output of `print(ans)`.

Given this information, the output of the `print(ans)` statement will be the count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string `a`.

Since the exact value of `a` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe the output based on the structure of the problem.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total count of 'map' and 'pie' substrings in the string `a`)**
