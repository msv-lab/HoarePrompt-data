Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string with length greater than 5 if the original `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `a` is a string with length greater than 2; `s` is the substring `a[i:i + 3]`. If the original `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4. If the original `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie', then `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2.**
