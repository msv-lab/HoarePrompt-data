Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string with length greater than `i + 2`; `s` is the substring `a[i:i + 3]`. If the original `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 3 and `i` is 9. If the original `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie', then `ans` is 0 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 2 or 1 and `i` is 5.**
