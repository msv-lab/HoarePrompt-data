In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `_` and the range is determined by the integer input, which is the number of test cases `t`. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the range is determined by `int(input())`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value is within the valid range for `t`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the integer input.
2. The input value must be an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
3. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted in the state description.

Given this, the state should be adjusted to ensure that the input value for `t` is within the valid range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
