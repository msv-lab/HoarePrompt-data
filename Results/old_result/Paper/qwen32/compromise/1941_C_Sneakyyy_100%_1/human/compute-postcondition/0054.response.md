The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. The loop iterates a number of times equal to the value obtained from `int(input())`, which is stored in the variable `iterations`.

Given the loop statement:
```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute `iterations` times. At the end of the previous iteration, `iterations` is the value obtained from `int(input())`. For the loop to execute one more time, `iterations` must be greater than 0, and each time the loop runs, `iterations` is effectively decremented by 1 internally by the `range` function.

Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the continuation of the loop, we only need to consider `iterations`. After the previous iteration, `iterations` would have been decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `iterations` must have been at least 1 before the decrement.

State: **`iterations` is the value obtained from `int(input())` and must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value obtained from `input()`, `ans` is the total count of 'map' and 'pie' substrings in `a`, `i` is the smallest integer such that `i >= len(a) - 2`**
