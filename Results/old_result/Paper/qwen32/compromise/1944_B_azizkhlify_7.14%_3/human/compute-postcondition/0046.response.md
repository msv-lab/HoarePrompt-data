Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `k` is defined as `2 * k - ul`, but we need to clarify that this definition is circular and doesn't provide a clear initial value for `k` without more context. However, it's stated that `k` is not zero.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `a`.
   - `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`.
   - `re` is initialized to 0.
   - `ul` is the total count of elements that appear exactly twice in the list `a`, multiplied by 2.
   - `ur` is initialized to 0.
   - `res` is an empty list.
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - The element at index `i` in `a` appears exactly once in the list `a` (i.e., `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`).

2. **Focus on the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(a[i], end=' ')`.
   - Given that `i` is initialized to 0, the print statement will output the element at index 0 of the list `a`.

3. **Determine the Value of `a[0]`:**
   - The precondition states that the element at index `i` (which is 0) in `a` appears exactly once in the list `a` (i.e., `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`).
   - This means `a[0]` is a unique element in the list `a` (it does not repeat anywhere else in the list).

### Conclusion
Based on the information provided, the print statement will output the element at index 0 of the list `a`, which we know is unique in the list `a`. However, the exact numerical value of `a[0]` is not specified in the initial state, so we can only describe it as the unique element at index 0 in the list `a`.

Output: **a[0] (where a[0] is the unique element at index 0 in the list `a`)**
