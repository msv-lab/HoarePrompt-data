To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], end=' ')`, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and identify the values or descriptions of the variables involved.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`t`**: An integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). This variable appears to be a loop counter or a test case counter but is not directly related to the print statement.
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than 0. This variable might represent the length of a list or array `a` but is not directly used in the print statement.
3. **`i`**: Incremented by 1. This suggests that `i` is an index that is being updated, possibly in a loop.

### Variables in the Print Statement:
- **`a`**: This is an array or list that is being indexed by `i`.
- **`i`**: The index used to access an element in the array `a`.

### Missing Information:
- **`a`**: The exact values or the structure of the array `a` are not provided. We don't know what values are stored in the array.
- **`i`**: The specific value of `i` at the time of the print statement is not provided. We only know that it is incremented by 1, but its initial value is unknown.

### Conclusion:
Given the information provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[i]` because the array `a` and the index `i` are not fully defined. However, we can describe the output in terms of the variables provided.

### Output Description:
The code will print the element at index `i` of the list `a`, followed by a space. The exact value of `a[i]` depends on the values stored in the list `a` and the current value of `i`.

Output: **a[i] (where a is the list and i is the current index)**
