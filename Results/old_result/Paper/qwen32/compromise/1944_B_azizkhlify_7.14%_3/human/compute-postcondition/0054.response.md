Let's break down the given information step-by-step to determine the output of the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
2. `n` is an integer greater than 0.
3. `k` is defined as `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not zero.
4. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
5. `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `a`.
6. `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`.
7. `ul` is the total count of elements that appear exactly twice in the list `a`, multiplied by 2.
8. `ur` is 0.
9. `i` is 1.
10. The code has a condition: if `re` equals `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `re` equals `k`, `res` is a list containing the first element of `a` if the element at index `i` in `a` appears exactly once in the list `a` (i.e., `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`), otherwise `res` is an empty list. If `re` does not equal `k`, the program does nothing and continues.

### Code to Analyze:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- The list `a` is a list of integers, but its exact values are not provided.
- The `print` statement outputs the element at index `i` of the list `a` followed by a space.

### Output:
Since `i` is 1, the `print` statement will output the element at index 1 of the list `a`.

Given the initial state, we don't have the exact values of the list `a`, so we can't provide a specific numerical value for `a[1]`. However, we know that `a[1]` is the second element of the list `a`.

Output: **a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list `a`)**
