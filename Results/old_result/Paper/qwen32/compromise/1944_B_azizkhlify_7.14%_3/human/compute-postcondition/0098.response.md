To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the conditions and changes within the loop. The loop iterates from `i = n` to `i = 2 * n - 1`. In each iteration, it checks if the count of `a[i]` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]` is exactly 2. If so, it prints the element twice and increments `ur` by 2. The loop breaks if `ul` equals `ur`.

Given the provided states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop continues until `ul` equals `ur` or all iterations are completed. 

Let's break down the final state:

1. **t**: Remains unchanged.
2. **n**: Remains unchanged.
3. **k**: Remains unchanged.
4. **a**: Remains unchanged.
5. **l**: Remains unchanged.
6. **r**: Remains unchanged.
7. **ul**: Remains unchanged.
8. **ur**: This could be 0, 2, 4, ..., up to `ul` if the loop completes all iterations.
9. **i**: At the end of the loop, `i` will be `2 * n` (the loop ends after `i` reaches `2 * n - 1`).
10. **res**: Remains unchanged (empty list).
11. **k**: Remains unchanged.
12. **re**: Remains unchanged.

The loop ends either when `ul` equals `ur` or when `i` reaches `2 * n`. Therefore, the final state of `ur` will be either `ul` (if the loop breaks due to `ul == ur`) or `2 * (n - n)` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking.

Since `ul` is the total count of elements that appear exactly twice in the list `a`, multiplied by 2, and `ur` accumulates by 2 for each element that appears exactly twice in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`, the loop will end when `ur` equals `ul` if such elements exist within the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`.

**Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; n is an integer greater than 0; k is 2 * k - ul; a is a list of integers obtained from the input; l is a list of n integers where each element at index j is the count of occurrences of j + 1 in the list a; r is a list of n integers where each element at index j is the count of occurrences of j + 1 in the sublist a[n:2 * n]; ul is the total count of elements that appear exactly twice in the list a, multiplied by 2; ur is equal to ul if the loop breaks due to ul == ur, otherwise ur is 2 * (n - n); i is 2 * n; res is an empty list; k is not zero; re is the count of elements in a that appear exactly once, up to the n-th iteration.**

In simpler terms, the loop ends when `ur` equals `ul` or when all iterations are completed. The final value of `ur` will be `ul` if the loop breaks early, or it will be 0 if the loop completes all iterations without finding any elements that appear exactly twice in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`.
