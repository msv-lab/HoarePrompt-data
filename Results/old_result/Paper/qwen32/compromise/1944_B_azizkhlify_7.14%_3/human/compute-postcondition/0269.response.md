The `break` statement does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `l`, `a`, `re`, or `res`. It only terminates the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `2`, `n` is greater than `2`, `l[a[0] - 1]` is `1`. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is `1`, `re` is increased by `1` and `res` contains `a[2]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `re` or `res`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
