To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the specific print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- `k` is an integer obtained from the input.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `a`.
- `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`.
- `re` is 0.
- `ul` is either 2 or 0.
- `ur` is 0.
- `res` is an empty list.
- `i` is 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- The print statement will print the element at index `i` in the list `a` twice, separated by a space, and without a newline at the end due to `end=' '`.

### Output Determination:
- Since `i` is 1, the print statement will output the element at index 1 of the list `a`, twice.
- The exact value of `a[1]` is not provided in the initial state, so we will denote it as `a[1]`.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[1] a[1]** (where `a[1]` is the element at index 1 of the list `a`)
