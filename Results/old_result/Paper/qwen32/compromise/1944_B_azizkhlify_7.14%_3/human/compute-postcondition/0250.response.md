To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], end=' ')`, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state.

### Initial State:
- `i` is `0`.
- `n` is greater than `0`.
- `l[a[i] - 1]` is `1`.
- `res`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r` are as they were before entering the if condition.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The value of `i` is explicitly given as `0`.
2. **List `a`**: The value of `a[0]` is not directly provided, but we know that `l[a[0] - 1]` is `1`. This means that `a[0] - 1` is an index into the list `l` that contains the value `1`. Therefore, `a[0]` must be an integer such that when you subtract `1` from it, you get a valid index for `l` that points to `1`. However, the exact value of `a[0]` is not specified beyond this relationship.

Given the above information, we can only determine that `a[0]` is an integer such that `l[a[0] - 1]` equals `1`. Without the exact value of `a[0]`, we cannot determine a specific numerical value to print.

However, we can still describe the output in terms of the variable `a[0]`.

### Output:
The code prints the value of `a[i]` where `i` is `0`. Given the initial state, `a[0]` is an integer that satisfies the condition `l[a[0] - 1] == 1`.

Output: **a[0] (where a[0] is an integer such that l[a[0] - 1] == 1)**
