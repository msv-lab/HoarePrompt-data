Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `k` is `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not zero; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `a`; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`; `ul` is the total count of elements that appear exactly twice in the list `a`, multiplied by 2; `ur` is 0; `i` is 0. If the element at index `i` in `a` appears exactly once in the list `a` (i.e., `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`), then `re` is 1 and `res` is a list containing the first element of `a`. Otherwise, `re` remains 0 and `res` is an empty list.**
