The code `res.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `a` to the list `res`. Given the initial state, `i` is `1`, so `a[1]` is appended to `res`. The values of `i`, `n`, `l[a[0] - 1]`, and `re` are not changed by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `1`, `n` is greater than `1`, `l[a[0] - 1]` is `1`, `re` is increased by 1, `res` contains `a[1]`.**
