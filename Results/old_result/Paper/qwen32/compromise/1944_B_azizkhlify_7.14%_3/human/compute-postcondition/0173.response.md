The given initial state only mentions that `res` is a non-empty list. However, the print statement `print(i, end=' ')` involves a variable `i`, which is not defined in the initial state. Since `i` is not provided or defined in the given context, we cannot determine its exact value.

To provide a precise description, we need to consider that `i` could be any variable that holds a value at the point of execution. Without additional information about the value of `i`, we can only describe the output in terms of `i`.

Output: **i (where i is the value of the variable i at the point of execution)**
