To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the specific variables involved in the `print` statement.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- `k` is defined as `2 * k - ul`.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `a`.
- `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`.
- `ul` is the total count of elements that appear exactly twice in the list `a`, multiplied by 2.
- `ur` is 0 or 2.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `res` is an empty list.
- `k` is not zero.
- `re` is the count of elements in `a` that appear exactly once, up to the n-th iteration.
- If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Here, `i` is explicitly given as `n + 1`. Therefore, `a[i]` refers to the element at index `n + 1` in the list `a`.

Since the exact elements of the list `a` are not provided, we can't determine the specific numerical values of `a[n + 1]`. However, we know that `a[i]` (which is `a[n + 1]`) will be printed twice, separated by a space, and no newline will be added at the end due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Therefore, the output will be the element at index `n + 1` of the list `a`, printed twice, separated by a space.

Output: **a[n + 1] a[n + 1] (where a[n + 1] is the element at index n + 1 in the list a)**
