To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the variables. The loop iterates from `i = n` to `i = 2 * n - 1`, meaning it runs `n` times in total.

Here is the loop code again for reference:
```python
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    r[a[i] - 1] += 1
```

In each iteration, the loop increments the value at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` by 1.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that after `n` iterations, the list `r` will have been updated `n` times according to the values in `a` from index `n` to `2 * n - 1`.

### Output State Calculation

- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`k`**: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`a`**: Remains unchanged as it is only used to read values, not modified.
- **`l`**: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`r`**: This list will be updated `n` times. Specifically, for each `i` in the range `[n, 2 * n)`, `r[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented by 1. Thus, after the loop completes, `r[j]` will contain the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`.
- **`re`**: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`ul`**: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`ur`**: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`res`**: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop finishes, `i` will be `2 * n - 1`.

### Natural Language Description

After the loop completes all its iterations, the list `r` will reflect the count of occurrences of each integer from 1 to `n` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`. Specifically, `r[j]` will be the number of times `j + 1` appears in this sublist. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, `res`) will remain unchanged.

### Final Output State

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `k` is an integer obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `a`; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`; `re` is 0; `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is `2 * n - 1`.**
