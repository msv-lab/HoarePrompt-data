Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is greater than 0; `re` equals `k`; `res` contains `a[i]` as its last element where `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `re`, and `res` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that the program exits the most internal loop or if statement.
