Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, all elements of `res` have been printed, `i` is `i + 1`, and the state of other variables remains unchanged. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement. No changes are made to the values of `n`, `res`, or `i`. The condition that `ul` equals `ur` leading to the `break` statement is still valid, but no further changes occur to `ul` or `ur` in this snippet.
