To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`, we need to analyze the given initial state and the context provided.

Here's the breakdown of the relevant information:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
2. `n` is an integer greater than 0.
3. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
4. `i` is set to `n + 2`.

The `print` statement in question is `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`. This means it will print the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, followed by a space.

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is set to `n + 2`.

Thus, the element that will be printed is `a[n + 2]`.

Since the exact content of the list `a` is not provided, we can't determine the specific numerical value of `a[n + 2]`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the given information.

Output: **a[n + 2], a[n + 2] (where a[n + 2] is the element at index n + 2 in the list a)**
