You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2 1
    
    1 2 2 1
    
    6 1
    
    6 4 2 1 2 3 1 6 3 5 5 4
    
    4 1
    
    1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
    
    6 2
    
    5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2

Output

    2 1
    2 1
    6 4
    1 3
    1 2
    1 2
    5 1 3 3
    6 4 2 4
    
Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

        (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

        print()



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `2n` integers. It then prints pairs of integers that appear exactly twice in the list, ensuring that `k` pairs are printed from the first half of the list. If fewer than `k` pairs are found in the first half, it prints additional integers that appear exactly once until `k` pairs and `k` single integers are printed in total. Finally, it balances the output by printing pairs from the second half of the list if necessary.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`. The program seems to be attempting to construct `l` and `r` by selecting pairs of identical elements and then adding single elements, but it does not guarantee that the XOR condition is satisfied.

Let's consider a specific case to illustrate the issue:

### Example Case:
Input:
```
1
6 2
5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2
```

Expected Output (one of the possible correct outputs):
```
5 1 3 3
5 1 2 6
```
In this case, the XOR of `5 ^ 1 ^ 3 ^ 3` is `5 ^ 1`, and the XOR of `5 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 6` is also `5 ^ 1`, which satisfies the condition.

However, the given program might output something like:
```
5 1 3 3
5 1 2 4
```
Here, the XOR of `5 ^ 1 ^ 3 ^ 3` is `5 ^ 1`, but the XOR of `5 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 4` is not `5 ^ 1`, which does not satisfy the condition.

### Why the Code is Incorrect:
The program does not ensure that the XOR of elements in `l` and `r` are equal. It simply selects pairs of identical elements and then adds single elements without checking the XOR condition. This can lead to cases where the XOR condition is not satisfied.

### Conclusion:
Since there exists at least one case where the program does not produce the correct output as per the problem description, the program is incorrect.
