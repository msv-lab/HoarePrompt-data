You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

    #State: The final output state consists of the concatenated outputs for each of the `t` test cases, where each test case outputs `res` (calculated as the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`), `n << 1`, and a series of commands for `n` down to 1, each command printing a row of the matrix twice.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the size of an `n × n` matrix. For each test case, it calculates a specific value `res` and prints this value along with `n << 1`. It then prints a series of commands that describe operations on the matrix, effectively simulating filling the matrix in a specific pattern twice for each row from `n` down to `1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. The operations involve filling rows or columns with permutations of the numbers from 1 to \( n \).

### Key Observations:
1. **Maximizing the Sum**: The sum of all elements in the matrix can be maximized by filling the matrix such that each number from 1 to \( n \) appears as many times as possible in the matrix. The highest possible sum would be achieved if each number from 1 to \( n \) appears in every row and every column (which is not possible directly due to the permutation constraint), but we can aim to get close to this.

2. **Permutation Constraint**: Each row and each column can only be filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \). This means each number from 1 to \( n \) can appear exactly once in each row and each column.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: One optimal strategy is to fill the matrix in such a way that the highest possible numbers are distributed across the matrix. A common approach is to fill the first row with \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), the second row with \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), and so on. This can be achieved by performing \( n \) Type 1 operations (one for each row).

4. **Second Set of Operations**: To maximize the sum further, we can perform \( n \) Type 2 operations (one for each column) to ensure that the highest possible numbers are distributed in the columns as well.

5. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the numbers from 1 to \( n \) is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \). Each row and each column will contribute to the sum, and the maximum sum can be calculated as the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers repeated \( n \) times, minus the overcounting due to the permutation constraint. However, the program calculates the sum using a specific formula that seems to be based on the pattern of the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers.

### Program Analysis
The program provided follows the above strategy:
1. **Matrix Initialization**: The matrix is initialized with the identity permutation for each row.
2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum is calculated using the formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i+1) \times (2i+1) \).
3. **Operations**: The program performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, which is within the \( 2n \) limit.

### Correctness Check
Let's verify the correctness of the program with the given examples:
- **Example 1 (n=1)**: The matrix is \( [1] \). The sum is 1, and one Type 1 operation is performed.
- **Example 2 (n=2)**: The matrix is filled as follows:
  - After Type 1 operations: 
    \[
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 2 \\
    1 & 2
    \end{bmatrix}
    \]
  - After Type 2 operations:
    \[
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 2 \\
    2 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \]
  The sum is \( 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7 \).

The program seems to correctly calculate the maximum sum and the operations required.

### Conclusion
The program follows an optimal strategy and correctly calculates the maximum sum and the operations required for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
