### Reasoning:

Let's verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
2. **Operations**:
   - Type 1: Fill a row \( i \) with a permutation \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \).
   - Type 2: Fill a column \( i \) with a permutation \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \).

#### Strategy:
- To maximize the sum, we need to distribute the highest possible numbers across the matrix while respecting the permutation constraint.
- One effective strategy is to fill the matrix with permutations that ensure the highest numbers are spread out as much as possible.

#### Program Analysis:
- **Initialization**: The matrix is initialized with identity permutations for each row.
- **Sum Calculation**: The sum is calculated using the formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i+1) \times (2i+1) \).
- **Operations**: The program performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations.

#### Verification:
- **Example 1 (n=1)**:
  - Matrix: \([1]\)
  - Sum: \(1\)
  - Operation: Type 1 on row 1 with permutation \([1]\)
- **Example 2 (n=2)**:
  - Matrix after Type 1 operations:
    \[
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 2 \\
    1 & 2
    \end{bmatrix}
    \]
  - Matrix after Type 2 operations:
    \[
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 2 \\
    2 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \]
  - Sum: \(1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7\)

#### Sum Calculation:
- The formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i+1) \times (2i+1) \) is used to calculate the sum.
- Let's verify this formula for \( n = 2 \):
  \[
  \sum_{i=0}^{1} (i+1) \times (2i+1) = (1 \times 1) + (2 \times 3) = 1 + 6 = 7
  \]
- This matches the expected sum.

#### Operations:
- The program performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, which is within the \( 2n \) limit.
- The operations described in the function summary are consistent with the program's behavior.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and the operations required for each test case. The sum calculation formula is verified to be correct, and the operations ensure that the matrix is filled optimally.

**Final: True**
