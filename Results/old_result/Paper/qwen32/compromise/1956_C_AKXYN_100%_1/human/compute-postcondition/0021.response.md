To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop and its behavior:

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
    print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```
This loop starts with `i` equal to `n` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches 1. 

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
1. After the first iteration, `i` was `n`.
2. After the second iteration, `i` was `n-1`.
3. After the third iteration, `i` was `n-2`.

The loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches 1. Therefore, the final iteration of the loop will have `i` equal to 1.

The variables `t`, `mat`, and `res` are not modified within the loop, so their values remain unchanged from the initial state.

Thus, after all the iterations are complete, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is 1**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing, `i` will be 1, and all other variables (`t`, `mat`, and `res`) will retain their initial values.
