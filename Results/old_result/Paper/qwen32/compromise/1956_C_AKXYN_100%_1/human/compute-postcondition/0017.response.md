Let's break down the given information and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 (not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n` (not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1` (not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `i` is explicitly set to 2.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **`'2 %d' % i`**:
   - `%d` is a placeholder for an integer.
   - `i` is explicitly set to 2.
   - So, `'2 %d' % i` will be `'2 2'`.

2. **`*range(1, n + 1)`**:
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence into individual arguments for the `print` function.
   - Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we will represent the sequence as `1, 2, ..., n`.

### Combining the Results:
- The first part of the print statement is `'2 2'`.
- The second part is the unpacked sequence `1, 2, ..., n`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output `'2 2'` followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **2 2 1 2 ... n (where n is a positive integer greater than 0)**
