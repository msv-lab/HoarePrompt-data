The code snippet `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` modifies the value of `res` by adding the result of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so we can calculate the new value of `res` as follows:

- `i + 1` equals `2 + 1` which is `3`.
- `2 * i + 1` equals `2 * 2 + 1` which is `5`.
- Therefore, `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` equals `3 * 5` which is `15`.
- The initial value of `res` is 6, so after the operation, `res` becomes `6 + 15` which is `21`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `mat`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` must be greater than 2, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 21, `i` is 2**
