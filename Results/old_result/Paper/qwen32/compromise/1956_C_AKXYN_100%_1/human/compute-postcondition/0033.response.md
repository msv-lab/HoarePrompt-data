To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the variables and their values based on the initial state provided.

1. **res**: The value of `res` is explicitly given as 110.
2. **n**: The value of `n` is an input integer, but its exact value isn't specified in the initial state. However, we know it's used to define the dimensions of the matrix `mat` and is used in the expression `n << 1`.
3. **n << 1**: This is a bitwise left shift operation. Shifting `n` left by 1 bit is equivalent to multiplying `n` by 2. Therefore, `n << 1` will output `2 * n`.

Given the above, the print statement `print(res, n << 1)` will output the value of `res` (which is 110) followed by the value of `2 * n`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, the output will be in terms of `n`.

Output: **110, 2 * n (where n is the input integer)**
