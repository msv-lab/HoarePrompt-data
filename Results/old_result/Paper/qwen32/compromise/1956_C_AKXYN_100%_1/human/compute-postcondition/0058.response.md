Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `res` is 110 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n` (though this matrix is not used in the print statement).
   - `i` is `n-1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - `print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))`

Let's analyze the print statement:
- `'2 %d' % i`: This part of the print statement formats the string to include the value of `i`. The `%d` is a placeholder for an integer, which will be replaced by the value of `i`.
- `*range(1, n + 1)`: The `*` operator unpacks the range object into separate arguments to the print function. `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Given that `i` is `n-1`, the print statement will output:
- The string `'2 %d'` with `i` inserted in place of `%d`, resulting in `'2 n-1'`.
- Followed by the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `i`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output `'2 n-1'` followed by the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **2 n-1 1 2 3 ... n (where n is a positive integer greater than 0)**
