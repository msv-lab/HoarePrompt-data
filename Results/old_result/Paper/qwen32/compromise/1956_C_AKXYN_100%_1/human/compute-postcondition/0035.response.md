Let's break down the given code snippet and initial state to determine the exact output.

### Initial State:
- `res` is 110 (not used in the print statement).
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 (not used in the print statement).
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n` (not used in the print statement).
- `i` is `n-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **`'1 %d' % i`**:
   - This part of the print statement formats the integer `i` into a string and prints it after the character '1'.
   - Given that `i` is `n-1`, the string will be `'1 %d' % (n-1)`, which translates to `'1 n-1'`.

2. **`*range(1, n + 1)`**:
   - The `*` operator in this context unpacks the range object into individual elements.
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - Therefore, `*range(1, n + 1)` will print each integer from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

### Output Explanation:
- The first part of the print statement will output `'1 n-1'`.
- The second part will output the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `n-1` or the specific sequence of numbers. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output:

Output: **1 n-1 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the number of rows and columns in the matrix `mat`)**
