Let's break down the provided initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `res` is 110 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n` (though this matrix is not used in the print statement).
   - `i` is `n-1`.

2. **Print statement analysis:**
   - The print statement is: `print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))`.
   - `'1 %d' % i`: This part of the statement formats the integer `i` into a string and concatenates it with '1 '. So, this will print '1 ' followed by the value of `i`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: The `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`. The `*` operator unpacks this sequence so that each number is printed as a separate argument to the `print` function.

3. **Determining the exact output:**
   - Since `i` is `n-1`, the first part of the output will be '1 ' followed by `n-1`.
   - The second part of the output will be the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Putting it all together, the output will be:
- '1 ' followed by `n-1`
- Then, the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't give a numerical output. However, we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **1 [n-1] 1 2 3 ... [n] (where n is a positive integer greater than 0)**

For example, if `n` were 5, the output would be:
Output: **1 4 1 2 3 4 5**

But since `n` is not specified, the most precise description is:
Output: **1 [n-1] 1 2 3 ... [n] (where n is a positive integer greater than 0)**
