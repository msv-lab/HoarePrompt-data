The code snippet increments `res` by the value of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the calculation for the increment is `(1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) = 2 * 3 = 6`. Therefore, `res` changes from 1 to 7. The values of `t`, `n`, `mat`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is 7, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 1**.
