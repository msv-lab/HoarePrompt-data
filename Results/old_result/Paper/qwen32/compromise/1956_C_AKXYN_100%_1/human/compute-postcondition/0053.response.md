The code snippet increments `res` by the value of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 2, we can calculate the increment as follows:

- `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` = `(2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1)` = `3 * 5` = `15`.

Thus, `res` which was initially 7, becomes `7 + 15` = `22`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mat`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is 22, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 2**.
