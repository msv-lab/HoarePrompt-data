The code snippet `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is `i_next`, which is the next element in `palka` after `i_current`. This operation does not affect `palka`, `i_current`, or `i_next`; it only modifies the dictionary `d`.

Therefore, the updated value of `d[i]` will be its previous value plus one.

Output State: **`i` is `i_next`, where `i_next` is the next element in `palka` after `i_current`; `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**
