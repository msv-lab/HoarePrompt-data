Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, then `d` now contains the key-value pair `{i: 1}`. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1. Additionally, `i` is not in `pl`.**
