The code snippet `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. This means that `pl` now contains one additional element, which is the value of `i`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `d` remains unchanged because the code snippet does not modify `d`.
- `pl` now includes the element `i` at the end of the list.
- `shapes` remains unchanged because the code snippet does not modify `shapes`.
- `w` remains unchanged because the code snippet does not modify `w`.
- `ln` remains unchanged because the code snippet does not modify `ln`.
- `palka` remains unchanged because the code snippet does not modify `palka`.
- `i_current` remains unchanged because the code snippet does not modify `i_current`.
- `i` remains unchanged because the code snippet does not modify `i`; it only uses `i` to append to `pl`.
- `i_next` remains unchanged because the code snippet does not modify `i_next`.

Output State: **`d` is a dictionary where if `i_current` was not originally a key, it is now added with a value of 1; otherwise, its value is incremented by 1; `pl` is a list that now includes `i` as its last element; `shapes` is updated to reflect the total number of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`; `w` is `k-1`; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one element; `i_current` was not in `pl` and is now included in `pl`; `i` is `i_next`, where `i_next` is the next element in `palka` after `i_current`.**
