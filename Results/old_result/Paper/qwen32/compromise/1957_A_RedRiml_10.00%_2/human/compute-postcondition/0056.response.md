The given code snippet is `d[i] = 1`. This line of code assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. If the key `i` already exists in the dictionary, its value will be overwritten with `1`.

Given the initial state, the dictionary `d` could already have some keys with values. However, after executing the line `d[i] = 1`, the key `i` will definitely have the value `1`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the new input and must contain at least one element; `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` has the value `1` (overwriting any previous value); `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the old `palka` that appear at least 3 times; If `i` was not in `pl` before the if statement, `pl` now contains the element `i`; `i` is the next element in `palka`.**
