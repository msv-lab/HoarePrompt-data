To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `i` from `for i in palka:`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100;
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100;
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100;
- `w` is 1;
- `ln` is an input integer;
- `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element;
- `pl` is a list that may contain the element `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`;
- `d` is a dictionary where if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, then `d` now contains the key-value pair `{i: 1}`, otherwise `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

In the previous iteration, the loop processed an element `i` from the list `palka`. To proceed to the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in `palka`.

Let's denote the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. The next value of `i` at the start of the next iteration would be the next element in the list `palka` after `i_prev`.

Since we don't know the exact values or the length of `palka`, we can only say that `i` should be the next element in the list `palka` relative to its current value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `pl` is a list that may contain the element `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`; `d` is a dictionary where if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, then `d` now contains the key-value pair `{i: 1}`, otherwise `d[i]` is incremented by 1; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`.**
