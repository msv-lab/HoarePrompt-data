The code snippet `ln = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `ln`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, or `w`. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer.**
