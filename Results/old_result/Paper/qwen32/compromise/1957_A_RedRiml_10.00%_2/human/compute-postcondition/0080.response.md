To determine the output of the `print(shapes)` statement, let's break down the initial state and how the variables are defined:

1. **`d`**: This is a dictionary that contains the counts of each unique element in the list `palka`. For example, if `palka` is `['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'banana']`, then `d` would be `{'apple': 2, 'banana': 3, 'orange': 1}`.

2. **`pl`**: This is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared. Using the same example above, `pl` would be `['apple', 'banana', 'orange']`.

3. **`shapes`**: This variable represents the total number of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in the dictionary `d`. Continuing with the example, `shapes` would be `1` because only `'banana'` appears 3 times in `palka`.

Given these definitions, the `print(shapes)` statement will output the value of `shapes`, which is the count of unique elements in `pl` that appear 3 or more times in `palka`.

Since the specific contents of `palka` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `shapes`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `shapes`.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the number of unique elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`)**
