Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `d` is an empty dictionary, `pl` is an empty list, `shapes` is the total number of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`, `w` is `k-1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `d` is a dictionary where if `i` was not originally a key, it is now added with a value of 1. If `i` was already a key, its value is incremented by 1. `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the element `i` depending on whether `i` was originally in `pl` or not. `shapes` is updated to reflect the total number of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`. `w` is `k-1`, `ln` is an input integer, and `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one element. If `i` was not in `pl`, `pl` now includes `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `d` is a dictionary where if `i_current` was not originally a key, it is now added with a value of 1; otherwise, its value is incremented by 1. `pl` is a list that includes `i` as its last element if `i` was not already in `pl`. `shapes` is updated to reflect the total number of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`. `w` is `k-1`. `ln` is an input integer. `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one element. `i_current` is included in `pl` if it was not originally there. `i` is `i_next`, where `i_next` is the next element in `palka` after `i_current`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i_next`, where `i_next` is the next element in `palka` after `i_current`. If `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, `d[i]` is set to `1`. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by `1`. If `i` is not in `pl`, `i` is appended to `pl`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
