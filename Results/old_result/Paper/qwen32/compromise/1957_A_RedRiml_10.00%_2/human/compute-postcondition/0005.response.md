The code snippet provided initializes an empty dictionary `d`. No other variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the newly introduced dictionary `d`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is an empty dictionary.**
