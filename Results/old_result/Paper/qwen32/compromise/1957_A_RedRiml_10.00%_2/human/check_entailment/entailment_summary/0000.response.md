### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to understand whether it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The goal is to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed using the given sticks.
- A regular polygon requires at least 3 sticks of equal length.
- The solution should count how many distinct stick lengths appear at least 3 times, as each such length can form at least one regular polygon.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `w`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `ln` and their lengths `palka`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - A dictionary `d` is used to count occurrences of each stick length.
   - A list `pl` keeps track of unique stick lengths.

3. **Calculating Polygons:**
   - The variable `shapes` is initialized to zero.
   - For each unique stick length `j` in `pl`, if the count `d[j]` is at least 3, it increments `shapes` by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the code prints the value of `shapes`, which represents the number of unique stick lengths that can form at least one regular polygon.

#### Verification Against Example:
- **Test Case 1:** One stick of length 1. No polygon can be formed. Output: 0.
- **Test Case 2:** Two sticks of length 1. No polygon can be formed. Output: 0.
- **Test Case 3:** Four sticks of length 3. One square can be formed. Output: 1.
- **Test Case 4:** Four sticks of length 2 and five sticks of length 4. One pentagon and one square can be formed. Output: 2.

The code correctly counts the number of unique stick lengths that appear at least 3 times, which corresponds to the number of regular polygons that can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
