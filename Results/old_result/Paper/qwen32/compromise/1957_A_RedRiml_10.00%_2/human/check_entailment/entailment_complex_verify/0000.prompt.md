You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):

        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It calculates and prints the number of unique integers that appear at least three times in the list for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from the given sticks. The current implementation only checks if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length and counts such lengths as potential polygons, which is incorrect. It does not account for the fact that polygons require a minimum of 3 sides, and it also does not maximize the number of polygons that can be formed.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```
The program will output `1` because there are 6 sticks of length 2, and it counts this as one potential polygon. However, the correct answer should be `2`, as we can form two equilateral triangles using these 6 sticks.

Another example:
```
1
9
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
```
The program will output `1` because there are 9 sticks of length 2, and it counts this as one potential polygon. However, the correct answer should be `3`, as we can form three equilateral triangles using these 9 sticks.

To fix the program, it should consider forming the maximum number of polygons for each stick length by dividing the count of each stick length by the smallest possible number of sides (which is 3) and summing these values.

Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) is None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
        shapes = 0
        for j in d:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that for each stick length, it calculates how many complete polygons can be formed and sums these values to get the total number of polygons.
