### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the original program and the provided function summary to determine if the program meets the problem requirements.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts.
- **Prices**:
  - One yogurt costs `a` burles.
  - Two yogurts cost `b` burles (promotion price).
- **Input**:
  - Number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- **Output**:
  - Minimum cost for each test case.

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost based on the following logic:
1. If the cost of two yogurts (`b`) is less than twice the cost of one yogurt (`2 * a`), then it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. The cost is `n * a`.
2. If `n` is even, the cost is simply `(n / 2) * b`.
3. If `n` is odd, the cost is `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a` (buying `n - 1` yogurts in pairs and the last one individually).

#### Code Review:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

#### Issues:
- **Condition Check**: The condition `if B * 2 < C` is incorrect. It should be `if B * 2 > C` to correctly handle the case where buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying them individually.
- **Logic for Handling Even and Odd `n`**: The logic for handling even `n` and the condition check need to be corrected.

#### Corrected Logic:
1. If `b < 2 * a`, it's cheaper to buy two yogurts at the promotion price.
2. Calculate the number of pairs (`n // 2`) and the remaining yogurts (`n % 2`).
3. The cost is `(n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a`.

#### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b < 2 * a:
            pairs = n // 2
            remaining = n % 2
            print(pairs * b + remaining * a)
        else:
            print(n * a)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it incorrectly compares the cost of buying two yogurts at the promotion price versus individually when `b` is less than twice `a`. The condition `if B * 2 < C` should be `if B * 2 > C` to handle this edge case correctly.

### Final Answer:
**Final: False**

The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect condition check and logic for determining the minimum cost.
