Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given the number of yogurts `n` Maxim wants to buy.
   - We are also given the price `a` of one yogurt and the price `b` of two yogurts during the promotion.
   - The goal is to find the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.

2. **Logic to Find Minimum Cost:**
   - **Case 1:** If the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (2*a) is less than the promotion price (b), then it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. The total cost is `n * a`.
   - **Case 2:** If the cost of buying two yogurts during the promotion (b) is cheaper or equal to the cost of buying two yogurts individually (2*a), then:
     - If `n` is even, Maxim can buy all yogurts in pairs, and the total cost is `(n/2) * b`.
     - If `n` is odd, Maxim can buy `(n-1)` yogurts in pairs (which costs `((n-1)/2) * b`) and buy the remaining one yogurt individually (which costs `a`). The total cost is `(((n-1)/2) * b) + a`.

### Program Analysis

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

- **Input Parsing:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the values `n`, `a`, and `b`.

- **Logic Implementation:**
  - **Case 1:** If `2*a < b`, it correctly calculates the cost as `n * a`.
  - **Case 2:** 
    - If `n` is even (`A % 2 == 0`), it correctly calculates the cost as `(n/2) * b`.
    - If `n` is odd, it calculates the cost as `(n//2) * b + a`. However, the variable names are a bit misleading. Here, `A` stands for `n`, `B` stands for `a`, and `C` stands for `b`. So, the cost should be `(A // 2) * C + B`, which is correctly implemented.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
