### Reasoning:

The program's logic is based on the count of facing-up coins ('U') in the string `s`. The key insight is that the game's outcome depends on whether the number of 'U's is odd or even. If the number of 'U's is odd, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win. This is because the game involves removing a 'U' and flipping its adjacent coins, and the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of 'U's determines who will be the last to make a move.

Let's analyze the provided test cases:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `5`, `UUDUD`
   - Count of 'U's: 3 (odd)
   - Expected Output: `YES`
   - Program Output: `YES`

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `5`, `UDDUD`
   - Count of 'U's: 2 (even)
   - Expected Output: `NO`
   - Program Output: `NO`

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `2`, `UU`
   - Count of 'U's: 2 (even)
   - Expected Output: `NO`
   - Program Output: `NO`

In all the test cases, the program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of 'U's. Therefore, the program adheres to the problem statement and correctly implements the logic to determine the winner.
