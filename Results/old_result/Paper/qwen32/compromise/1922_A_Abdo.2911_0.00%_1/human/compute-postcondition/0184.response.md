Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` â‰¤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values of user input with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 0; `template` is a list containing either the character `a[0]` or the uppercase version of the first character of `a`; `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` if `template` contains `a[0]`, otherwise `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. If `match_a_b` is `True` and `match_c` is `False`, then `match_a_b` remains `True` and `match_c` remains `False`. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is `False` or `match_c` is `True` (or both).**
