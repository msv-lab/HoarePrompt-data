Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` â‰¤ 999; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is the string value of user input with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `b` is the new string value of user input with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `c` is the new string value of user input with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`; If `match_a_b` is `True` and `match_c` is `False`, then `match_a_b` remains `True` and `match_c` remains `False`. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is `False` or `match_c` is `True` (or both).**
