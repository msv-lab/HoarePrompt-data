Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` where each character at index `i` is either the character of `a[i]` or its uppercase version depending on whether `a[i]` equals `b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `False`; `match_c` is `True`; `i` is 0; `template[i]` is lowercase; either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`**

In this output state, the value of `match_a_b` has been changed to `False`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
