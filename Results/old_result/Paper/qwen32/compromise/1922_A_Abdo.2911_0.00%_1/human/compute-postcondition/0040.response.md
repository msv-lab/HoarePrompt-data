The `break` statement will exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `template`, `i`, and `match_a_b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is either the character from `a` if it matches the character from `b` at the same index, or the uppercase version of the character from `a` if it does not match; `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4; `match_a_b` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
