Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` â‰¤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is an index such that `0 â‰¤ i < n`; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` up to the `n`-th character, where each character at index `i` is either `a[i]` or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `True` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise it is `False`; `match_c` is `False`; `template[i]` is not a lowercase character; `c[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`**

In this output state, the only change from the initial state is that the variable `match_c` has been set to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
