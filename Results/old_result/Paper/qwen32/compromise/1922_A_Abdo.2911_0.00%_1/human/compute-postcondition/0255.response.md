Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(0 < t \leq 999\).
2. `n` is greater than 0.
3. `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
4. `i` is `n-1`.
5. `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` up to the `n`-th character, where each character at index `i` is either `a[i]` or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`.
6. `match_a_b` is `True`.
7. `match_c` is `False`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet directly outputs the string `'YES'`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `template`, `match_a_b`, and `match_c` do not affect the output of this specific print statement because it explicitly prints `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
