Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is either the character from `a` if it matches the character from `b` at the same index, or the uppercase version of the character from `a` if it does not match; `match_a_b` retains its original value; `match_c` is False; `i` is 4**.

In this output state, the value of `match_c` has been set to `False`, while all other variables retain their original values as described in the initial state.
