The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` should be 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` where each character at index `i` is either the character of `a[i]` or its uppercase version depending on whether `a[i]` equals `b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `False` if either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, or if `template[i]` is lowercase and `a[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, otherwise `match_a_b` remains `True`; `match_c` is `True`; `i` is 1.**
