Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is either the character from `a` if it matches the character from `b` at the same index, or the uppercase version of the character from `a` if it does not match; `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4. If `template[4]` is lowercase, `match_a_b` is set to `False` if `a[4]` is not equal to `template[4]` or `b[4]` is not equal to `template[4]`. If `template[4]` is uppercase, `match_a_b` is set to `False` if `a[4].lower()` is equal to `template[4].lower()` or `b[4].lower()` is equal to `template[4].lower()`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains unchanged.**
