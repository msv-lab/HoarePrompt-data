The code appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the list `template`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and the initial state of `template` remain unchanged. The only change is that `template` now includes an additional element, `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `b` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `c` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list that now includes an additional element `a[i]`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
