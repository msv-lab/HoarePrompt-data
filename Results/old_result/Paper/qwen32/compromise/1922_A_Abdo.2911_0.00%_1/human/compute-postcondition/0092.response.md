The code snippet `template = []` reassigns the `template` variable to an empty list, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `b` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `c` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is an empty list; `match_a_b` is `True` if no conditions within the loop caused it to be set to `False` during any of the `n` iterations. Otherwise, `match_a_b` is `False`; `match_c` is `True` if no conditions within the loop caused it to be set to `False` during any of the `n` iterations. Otherwise, `match_c` is `False`; `i` is `n`.**
