Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` â‰¤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is `n-1`; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` up to the `n`-th character, where each character at index `i` is either `a[i]` or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `True`; `match_c` is either `True` or `False`. If `match_c` is `False`, then `match_a_b` remains `True` and `match_c` is updated to `False`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True` and `match_c` remains `True`.**
