Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` â‰¤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values of user input with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is `n-1` (the last index of the range `n`); `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` up to the `n`-th character, where each character at index `i` is either `a[i]` or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `template` contains `a[i]` at that position. `match_a_b` is `True`; `match_c` is `False` or `True` (or both) based on the original condition.**

In simpler terms, the variable `match_a_b` has been set to `True`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, and `template` remain unchanged. The state of `match_c` is not specified to change, so it retains its original value.
