The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the first character of `a` and either the second character of `a` or its uppercase version depending on whether `a[i]` equals `b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `True`; `match_c` is `True`; `i` is 2.**
