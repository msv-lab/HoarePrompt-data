Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Template Construction**: For each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the program checks if the characters at position `i` in strings `a` and `b` are the same. If they are the same, it appends the lowercase version of that character to the template. If they are different, it appends the uppercase version of the character from `a` (or `b`, it doesn't matter which one since they are different) to the template.

2. **Matching Check**:
   - **Matching `a` and `b`**: The program checks if both `a` and `b` match the constructed template. If the character in the template is lowercase, both `a` and `b` must have the same character at that position. If the character in the template is uppercase, both `a` and `b` must have a different character at that position.
   - **Non-Matching `c`**: The program checks if `c` does not match the template. If the character in the template is lowercase, `c` must have the same character at that position. If the character in the template is uppercase, `c` must have a different character at that position.

3. **Output**: If both `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, the program outputs "YES". Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

The logic and implementation correctly follow the problem requirements, so the program is correct.
