### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a subarray can be split into more than one part such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal. The provided solution uses a prefix XOR array and a map to efficiently determine if such a split is possible for each query.

Let's break down the solution:

1. **Prefix XOR Array (`pf`)**:
   - The prefix XOR array `pf` is used to store the cumulative XOR from the start of the array up to each index. This allows us to quickly compute the XOR of any subarray `a[l-1:r]` using `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.

2. **Map (`mp`)**:
   - The map `mp` stores the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs. This helps in quickly finding if there are multiple occurrences of the same prefix XOR value, which is crucial for determining if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query defined by `l` and `r`, the XOR of the subarray `a[l-1:r]` is computed using `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
   - If this XOR value (`x`) is zero, it means the entire subarray can be considered as one part with XOR zero, and the answer is "YES".
   - Otherwise, the solution checks if there are indices in the map `mp` such that there are multiple occurrences of the prefix XOR values that could indicate a valid split. Specifically, it checks if there is an index `i` in the range `[l, r]` where `pf[i] == pf[r]` and another index `j` before `i` where `pf[j] == pf[l-1]`. If such indices exist, it means the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR, and the answer is "YES". Otherwise, the answer is "NO".

### Correctness:

The solution correctly implements the required logic to determine if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR. It efficiently uses the prefix XOR array and a map to handle the queries within the constraints provided.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
