### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to determine if a subarray can be split into `k > 1` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal. The program uses prefix XOR and a map (dictionary) to track the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem statement:

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR for the array `a`. The prefix XOR at index `i`, denoted as `pf[i]`, is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i`.
   - This is done in the loop:
     ```python
     for i in range(1, n + 1):
         a[i] = int(data[index])
         index += 1
         pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
         mp[pf[i]].append(i)
     ```

2. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query defined by `l` and `r`, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l-1:r]` using the prefix XOR values:
     ```python
     x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
     ```
   - If `x` is `0`, the subarray `a[l-1:r]` can be trivially split into two parts with equal XOR (both parts having XOR `0`), so the program appends 'YES' to the results.
   - If `x` is not `0`, the program checks if there exists an index `i` such that `l <= i < r` and `pf[i] == pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`. This is done using binary search (`bisect_left`) on the list of indices stored in the dictionary `mp` for the prefix XOR value `pf[r]` and `pf[l-1]`.

3. **Binary Search and Condition Check**:
   - The program uses binary search to find the appropriate indices in the lists of occurrences of prefix XOR values:
     ```python
     v1 = mp[pf[r]]
     v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
     it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
     it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
     ```
   - It then checks if there is an index `i` in `v1` that is less than the index `j` in `v2` such that `l <= i < r` and `pf[i] == pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`. If such an index exists, it means the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR, and the program appends 'YES' to the results. Otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray can be split into `k > 1` parts with equal XOR using prefix XOR and binary search. The execution summary confirms that the program processes the input as intended and uses the prefix XOR values and binary search to check the condition for each query.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
