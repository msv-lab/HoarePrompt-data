The code snippet `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list in the defaultdict `mp` at the key `pf[i]`. Given the initial state, `pf[4]` is 0, so `mp[0]` will have the value `4` appended to its list.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the split input values where the first element can be converted to an integer greater than 0; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `index` is 4; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data` and must be greater than or equal to 1; `q` is the integer value of the third element in `data`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[3]` which is `int(data[3])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[4]` which is 0; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` is `[0, 4]`.**
