The code snippet `a = [0] * (n + 1)` reassigns the list `a` to be a new list of `n + 1` zeros, effectively discarding the previous values in `a` that were set based on the input data. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the split input values; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1; `index` is `n + 5`; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is `int(data[n + 4])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list of indices `j` such that `pf[j]` equals `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries.**
