The code snippet simply increments the `index` variable by 1. Therefore, the value of `index` will be `2n + 5 + 2*q + 4`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing at least 2n + 5 elements, `data[index - 2]` is a string representing an integer value greater than or equal to 1, `n` is `int(data[index - 2])`, `q` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `index` is `2n + 5 + 2*q + 4`, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 2, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[index])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `int(data[index - 1])`, `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list, `mp[0]` contains the value `[0]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the value `[i]`, `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries, `i` is `n`.**
