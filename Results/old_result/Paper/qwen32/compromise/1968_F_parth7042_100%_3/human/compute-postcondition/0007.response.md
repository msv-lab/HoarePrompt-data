The code snippet assigns the integer value of the element at position `index + 1` in the list `data` to the variable `q`. Given the initial state, `index` is 1, so `q` will be assigned the integer value of the third element in `data`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the split input values where the first element can be converted to an integer greater than 0; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data`; `q` is the integer value of the third element in `data`.**
