### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided program and its annotations against the problem statement and the original assessment.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Mathematical Insight Recap:
The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) simplifies to finding pairs where \(a\) is a multiple of \(b\) and \(a + b\) is divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Essentially, \(a\) should be a multiple of \(b\) and \(a + b\) should be divisible by \(b^2\) when \(\gcd(a, b) = b\).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program initializes `ans` with `n`, which correctly counts the pairs where \(b = 1\) (since every \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) will satisfy the condition when \(b = 1\)). For each \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\), it adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b^2} \right\rfloor\) to `ans`. Let's understand why this works:

For a fixed \(b\), the number of multiples of \(b\) up to \(n\) is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor\). However, the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b^2\) restricts \(a\) further. Specifically, \(a\) must be such that \(a + b = kb^2\) for some integer \(k\). This means \(a = kb^2 - b\). The valid values of \(a\) are those that are multiples of \(b\) and also satisfy \(1 \leq a \leq n\).

The term \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b^2} \right\rfloor\) counts the number of valid multiples of \(b\) that satisfy the condition. This is because it effectively counts the number of \(k\) such that \(kb^2 - b \leq n\), which simplifies to \(k \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b^2} \right\rfloor\).

#### Annotations:
The annotations confirm that `ans` is initialized to `n` and then incremented by \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b^2} \right\rfloor\) for each \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\). This aligns with the mathematical insight derived above.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the derived mathematical insight. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
