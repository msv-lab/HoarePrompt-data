The code snippet provided does not actually change the values of `n` and `m` since they are already described as input integers. The line `[n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]` is redundant because `n` and `m` are already integers as per the initial state description.

Therefore, the only change in the state is the increment of `T` by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are the new input integers, `ans` is `n + Σ((n + b) // (b * b)) for b from 2 to min(n, m)`, `T` is incremented by 1**.
