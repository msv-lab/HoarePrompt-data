The given code snippet modifies the variable `ans` by adding the result of the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` to it. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, while `b` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's break down the changes:
- `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`.
- `b` is incremented by 1.

Since the exact values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and the previous value of `b` are not specified, we'll express the new state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that `min(n, m) ≥ 2`, `b` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`**.

In natural language: The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` to it. The value of `b` is incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
