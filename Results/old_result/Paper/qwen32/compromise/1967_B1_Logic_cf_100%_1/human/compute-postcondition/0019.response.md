To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`. The loop iterates over `b` starting from 2 up to `min(n, m)` inclusive.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `n` must be at least 2
- `m` must be at least 2
- `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`
- `T` is incremented by 1

We need to adjust the state for the next iteration of the loop. Since `b` is the loop variable, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop head.

Let's break it down:

1. **Variable `b`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `b` was some value (let's call it `b_prev`). At the start of the next iteration, `b` will be `b_prev + 1`.
2. **Variable `n`:** Remains unchanged.
3. **Variable `m`:** Remains unchanged.
4. **Variable `ans`:** This is recalculated based on the new value of `b` at the start of the next iteration.
5. **Variable `T`:** This is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, so it remains unchanged at the start of the next iteration.

Since we don't know the exact value of `b` at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote the new value of `b` as `b_new = b_prev + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `b` is `b_prev + 1`, `ans` is `n + (n + b_new) // (b_new * b_new)`, `T` is incremented by 1**

However, since we don't know `b_prev`, we can express the state in terms of `b` directly:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `b` is incremented by 1, `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is incremented by 1**

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `b` is incremented by 1, `ans` is recalculated as `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is incremented by 1**
