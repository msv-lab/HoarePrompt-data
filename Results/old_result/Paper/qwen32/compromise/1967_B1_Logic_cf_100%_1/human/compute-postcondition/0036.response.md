To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`n`** and **`m`**: Integers (their specific values are not provided).
3. **`ans`**: Calculated as:
   \[
   n + \sum_{b=2}^{\min(n, m)} \left(\frac{n + b}{b \times b}\right)
   \]
4. **`T`**: Incremented by 1 (this variable is not used in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Calculation of `ans`:
- The variable `ans` is computed as the sum of two parts:
  - The first part is simply `n`.
  - The second part is a summation from `b = 2` to `b = \min(n, m)` of the expression \(\left(\frac{n + b}{b \times b}\right)\).

### Explanation of the Summation:
- For each integer `b` from 2 up to the smaller of `n` and `m`, the term \(\left(\frac{n + b}{b \times b}\right)\) is calculated and added to the total sum.
- This term is an integer division, meaning it will yield an integer result.

### Final Output:
Given the above breakdown, the output of the `print(ans)` statement will be the computed value of `ans` based on the provided formula.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not specified, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given formula.

Output: **ans (where ans is calculated as n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1)))**
