To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`. The loop iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 (this variable does not affect the loop directly)
- `n` must be at least 2
- `m` must be at least 2
- `b` is incremented by 1
- `ans` is recalculated as `n + (n + b) // (b * b) + (n + b) // (b * b)`
- `T` is incremented by 1

Since `b` is the loop variable and it is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `b` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's denote the value of `b` at the end of the previous iteration as `b_end`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `b` will be `b_end + 1`.

The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop head.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `t` remains the same (though it doesn't affect the loop)
- `n` remains the same
- `m` remains the same
- `b` is incremented by 1 from its previous value

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `b` is incremented by 1, `ans` is recalculated as `n + (n + b) // (b * b) + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is incremented by 1**

However, focusing only on the variables in the loop head:
State: **`n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `b` is incremented by 1**
