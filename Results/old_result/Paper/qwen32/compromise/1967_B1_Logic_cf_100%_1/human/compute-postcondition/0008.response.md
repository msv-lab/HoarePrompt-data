Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that `min(n, m) ≥ 2, `b` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and the incremented `b` remain unchanged from their previous states.
