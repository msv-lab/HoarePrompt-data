Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
The goal is to find the maximum number of segments in an array `a` such that:
1. The first segment starts at index 1.
2. The last segment ends at index `n`.
3. Each segment is contiguous.
4. The bitwise OR of the bitwise XORs of all segments is less than or equal to `x`.

### Code Analysis:

The code provided seems to attempt to solve the problem using a recursive strategy that focuses on the bits of `x` from the most significant to the least significant. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calls `find_max` with the initial bit set to 31 (the most significant bit for a 32-bit integer, which is suitable given the constraints of `x < 2^30`).

2. **Function `find_max`:**
   - **Base Case:** If `bit` is -1, it means all bits have been processed, and the function returns the length of the current array `cur_arr`. This is because, at this point, all segments are valid (since all bits have been considered).
   - **XOR Calculation:** It calculates the cumulative XOR of elements in `cur_arr`.
   - **Segmentation:** It creates new segments whenever the current cumulative XOR does not have the `bit`-th bit set. This is done by appending the current XOR to `new_arr` and resetting the XOR to 0.
   - **Handling Remaining XOR:** If the remaining XOR has the `bit`-th bit set, it sets `thing1` to -1, indicating that it's not possible to form valid segments with the current configuration.
   - **Recursive Calls:**
     - If the `bit`-th bit of `x` is set, it returns the maximum of two values:
       1. The result of `find_max` with the next lower bit.
       2. The length of `new_arr` (which represents the number of segments formed so far).
     - If the `bit`-th bit of `x` is not set, it returns `thing1`, which is either the result of `find_max` with the next lower bit or -1.

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Incorrect Base Case Handling:**
   - The base case in `find_max` returns the length of `cur_arr` when all bits have been processed. This is incorrect because it does not check if the cumulative XOR of the entire array (or the last segment) satisfies the condition with `x`.

2. **Incorrect Segmentation Logic:**
   - The code segments the array based on whether the cumulative XOR has a specific bit set. However, it does not ensure that the bitwise OR of all segments' XORs is less than or equal to `x`.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining XOR:**
   - The code sets `thing1` to -1 if the remaining XOR has the `bit`-th bit set, but it does not correctly handle the case where the remaining XOR is valid when combined with other segments.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of valid segments based on the problem's constraints. The base case handling, segmentation logic, and handling of the remaining XOR are all incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
