### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated version against the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We have `n` children and `m` pairs of friends with associated friendship values.
- The teacher randomly selects pairs of children for `k` excursions.
- If a selected pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for subsequent excursions.
- We need to find the expected sum of friendship values of the pairs chosen for all excursions, expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) and output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program does the following:
1. Reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - Reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - Computes `c` as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - Initializes `s` (sum of expected friendship values) and `a` (sum of initial friendship values).
   - For each friend pair, adds the initial friendship value `f` to `a`.
   - For each excursion, updates the sum `s` with the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.

#### Issues in the Provided Program:
- The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect for calculating the expected sum of friendship values. It does not correctly account for the increase in friendship values over multiple excursions.
- The correct approach involves calculating the expected increase in friendship values for each friend pair over `k` excursions and then summing these contributions.

#### Correct Formula:
- For each friend pair, the expected increase in friendship value over `k` excursions is the sum of an arithmetic series: \( f + (f+1) + (f+2) + \ldots + (f+k-1) \).
- This sum can be calculated as \( k \cdot f + \frac{k \cdot (k-1)}{2} \).
- The expected contribution of each friend pair to the total sum is then this value multiplied by the probability of selecting that pair, which is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

#### Corrected Program:
The corrected program correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        total_sum = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            # Expected increase in friendship value for this pair over k excursions
            expected_increase = (k * f + (k * (k - 1) // 2)) % M
            # Probability of selecting this pair in one excursion
            probability = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)
            # Contribution of this pair to the total expected sum
            contribution = (expected_increase * probability) % M
            total_sum = (total_sum + contribution) % M
        print(total_sum)

func()
```

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. The formula used in the provided program is incorrect, and the original assessment accurately identifies this issue.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
