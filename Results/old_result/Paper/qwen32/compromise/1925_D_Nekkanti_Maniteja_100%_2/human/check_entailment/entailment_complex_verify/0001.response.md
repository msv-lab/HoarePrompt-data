### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to determine the correctness of the provided solution.

#### Problem Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (m), and the number of excursions (k).
   - It then reads the details of each pair of friends (a_i, b_i, f_i).

2. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The probability of selecting any particular pair of children during an excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
   - This probability is used to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion can be derived by considering the contribution of each friend pair.
   - The contribution of a pair with initial friendship value \( f_i \) after \( i \) excursions is \( f_i + i \) (if the pair is chosen in the \( i \)-th excursion).
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values over k excursions can be calculated using the probabilities and the friendship values.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes the modulus \( M \) as \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - It calculates the modular inverse of \( \binom{n}{2} \) (which is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \)) using the `pow` function. This is used to calculate the probability of selecting any pair.
   - It initializes `s` (sum of expected values) and `a` (sum of initial friendship values).

2. **Reading Friendships:**
   - The program reads the details of each pair of friends and adds their initial friendship values to `a`.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the expected value by iterating over the number of excursions (k).
   - The formula used in the loop is incorrect. The program uses \( s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a \), which does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation.

#### Correctness:

The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The formula used to update `s` is incorrect and does not account for the correct probabilities and contributions of each friend pair.

### Correct Formula:

The correct expected value for each excursion can be calculated as follows:
- The expected contribution of a pair with initial friendship value \( f_i \) after \( i \) excursions is \( \left( f_i + \frac{i(i+1)}{2} \right) \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
- The expected value for all pairs over k excursions can be calculated by summing the expected contributions of all pairs.

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect due to the incorrect formula used for calculating the expected value.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the analysis and the incorrect formula used in the program, the original assessment is accurate. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
