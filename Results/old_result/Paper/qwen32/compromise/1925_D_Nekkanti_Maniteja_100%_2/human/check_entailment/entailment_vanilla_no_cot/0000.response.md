Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of the friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's break down why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of the Probability**:
   - The program calculates `c` as the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2`. This represents the probability of choosing any specific pair of children out of all possible pairs.
   - However, it incorrectly uses this probability in the subsequent calculations.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of the Expected Value**:
   - The program incorrectly accumulates the expected value `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each iteration of `i` in the range of `k`. This does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation.
   - The expected value should be calculated based on the probability of choosing each pair and the cumulative increase in their friendship values over the k excursions.

3. **Logic Errors**:
   - The program does not correctly account for the fact that each friend pair's friendship value increases by 1 each time it is chosen.
   - It does not correctly compute the expected value as a fraction and then take the modular inverse of the denominator.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        prob = pow(total_pairs, -1, MOD)  # Probability of choosing any specific pair
        expected_value = 0
        
        # Sum of initial friendship values
        initial_sum = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            initial_sum += f
        
        # Expected value from initial friendship values
        expected_value += (initial_sum * k * prob) % MOD
        
        # Expected value from the increase in friendship values
        # Each pair has a probability of prob to be chosen in each of the k excursions
        # The expected increase in friendship value for each pair is the sum of the first k natural numbers
        expected_increase_per_pair = (k * (k + 1) // 2) * prob % MOD
        expected_value += (expected_increase_per_pair * m * prob) % MOD
        
        print(expected_value % MOD)

func()
```

This corrected program calculates the expected value correctly by considering the initial friendship values and the expected increase in friendship values due to the excursions.
