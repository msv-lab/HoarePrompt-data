### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step to determine its correctness.

**Program Analysis:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes the modulus `M` as \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It calculates the total number of possible pairs `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It initializes `s` (sum of expected friendship values) and `a` (sum of initial friendship values) to 0.

2. **Processing Friend Pairs:**
   - For each of the `m` friend pairs, it reads `u`, `v`, and `f`.
   - It adds the initial friendship value `f` to `a`.

3. **Updating Sum for Each Excursion:**
   - For each of the `k` excursions, it updates the sum `s` using the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.

**Issues in the Program:**

The formula used in the loop for updating `s` is incorrect. Specifically, the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` does not accurately reflect the expected increase in the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions. Here's why:

- The expected increase in friendship value for a friend pair `(u, v)` over `k` excursions is the sum of an arithmetic series: \( f + (f+1) + (f+2) + \ldots + (f+k-1) \). This sum can be calculated as \( k \cdot f + \frac{k \cdot (k-1)}{2} \).
- The probability of selecting a specific friend pair in one excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \), which is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- The expected contribution of each friend pair to the total sum is the product of the expected increase in friendship value and the probability of selecting that pair.

**Correct Formula:**

The total expected sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions can be calculated by summing the expected contributions of all friend pairs. For each friend pair `(u, v)` with initial friendship value `f`, the expected contribution is:

\[ \text{contribution} = \left( \left(k \cdot f + \frac{k \cdot (k-1)}{2}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \mod (10^9 + 7) \]

**Original Assessment:**

The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the provided program and provides a corrected version. The corrected program uses the correct formula to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions.

### Final Evaluation:

Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. The corrected version of the program, as provided in the original assessment, is the correct implementation.

**Final: False**
