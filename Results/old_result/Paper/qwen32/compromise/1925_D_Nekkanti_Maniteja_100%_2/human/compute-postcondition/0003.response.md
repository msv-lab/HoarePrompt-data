The code calculates `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`. Given that `M` is 1000000007, `c` will be the value such that `(n * (n - 1) // 2) * c â‰¡ 1 (mod M)`.

The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers, and `M` is 1000000007. The value of `c` is newly introduced and calculated based on the given formula.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`.**
