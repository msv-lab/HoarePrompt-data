Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, we need to calculate the new state after the execution of the code.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` greater than 0
- `M` is 1000000007
- `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`
- `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input
- `i` is 1
- `s` is `s + c * a`
- `m` iterations have been completed
- `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers read from the input for each of the `m` iterations

Code to be executed:
```
s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
```

The code modifies the value of `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Let's calculate the new value of `s`:
- The original value of `s` is `s + c * a`
- We add `c * i * c * m + c * a` to `s`

Thus, the new value of `s` is:
`s = (s + c * a) + (c * i * c * m + c * a) = s + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a = s + 2 * c * a + c * i * c * m`

Since `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to:
`s = s + 2 * c * a + c * c * m`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` greater than 0; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`; `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input; `i` is 1; `s` is `s + 2 * c * a + c * c * m`; `m` iterations have been completed; `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers read from the input for each of the `m` iterations.**
