The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` must be greater than 0; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`; `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input across all `m` iterations; `i` is 2; `s` is `2 * c * a + c^2 * m`**
