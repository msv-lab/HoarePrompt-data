The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state only specifies the variable `t`, which remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will include the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` as read from the input, and `t` will retain its initial value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.**
