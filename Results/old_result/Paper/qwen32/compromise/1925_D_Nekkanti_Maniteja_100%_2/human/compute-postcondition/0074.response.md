Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. It also receives `m` lines of three integers each, `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, representing edges and associated values in a graph. The function returns a value (or performs an action) based on these inputs, but the specific return type or action is not detailed in the provided information.**
