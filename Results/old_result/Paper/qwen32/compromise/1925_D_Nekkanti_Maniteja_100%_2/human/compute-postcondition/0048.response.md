To determine the output of the `print(s % M)` statement, let's break down the given information step-by-step:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\).
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` greater than 0.
   - `M` is a constant integer set to \(1000000007\).
   - `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\) modulo `M`.
   - `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations.
   - `i` is calculated as `k + m - 1`.
   - `s` is calculated as \(\frac{c \times k \times (c \times m \times (k-1) + 2 \times a)}{2}\).
   - `m` iterations have been completed, where for each iteration, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers read from the input.

2. **The print statement:**
   - `print(s % M)`

3. **Determining the value of `s % M`:**
   - `s` is a complex expression involving `c`, `k`, `m`, and `a`.
   - `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\) modulo `M`, meaning \(c \times \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2} \equiv 1 \pmod{M}\).
   - `s` is calculated using the formula \(\frac{c \times k \times (c \times m \times (k-1) + 2 \times a)}{2}\).
   - The final output is `s % M`.

Given the complexity of the expression for `s`, and without specific values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and the `f` values from the input, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `s`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the given variables and the formula.

Output: **s % M (where s is calculated as \(\frac{c \times k \times (c \times m \times (k-1) + 2 \times a)}{2}\) and c is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\) modulo 1000000007)**
