Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the conversion of 24-hour time to 12-hour time correctly for all cases. Specifically, the program incorrectly converts the time "00:00" to "12:00 PM" instead of "12:00 AM". Additionally, the program incorrectly converts "12:00" to "12:00 AM" instead of "12:00 PM". 

Here are the problematic cases:
- Input: "00:00" -> Expected Output: "12:00 AM" -> Actual Output: "12:00 PM"
- Input: "12:00" -> Expected Output: "12:00 PM" -> Actual Output: "12:00 AM"

These cases demonstrate that the program does not correctly handle the conversion of times at the boundaries of the 12-hour clock (midnight and noon).
