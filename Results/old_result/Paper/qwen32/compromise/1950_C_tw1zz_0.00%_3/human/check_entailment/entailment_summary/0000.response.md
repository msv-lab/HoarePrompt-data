Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format by using a series of if-elif statements. However, there is a logical mistake in the handling of the hour '00'. According to the problem description, '00:00' should be converted to '12:00 AM', but the program incorrectly converts it to '12:00 PM'. This is the only error in the logic for converting hours, and all other hours are correctly mapped.

To ensure the program's correctness, the line:
```python
elif h == '00':
    h1 = '12'
    time = 'PM'
```
should be corrected to:
```python
elif h == '00':
    h1 = '12'
    time = 'AM'
```

Since this single error exists, the program does not meet the problem requirements as specified.

Correctness: **False**
