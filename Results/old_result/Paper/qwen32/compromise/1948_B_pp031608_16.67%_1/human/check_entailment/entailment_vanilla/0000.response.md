Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem's requirements to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `list1`.

2. **Operation Logic**:
   - The program attempts to perform the described operation by iterating over the array and checking if it is sorted using the `func_1` function.
   - If the array is not sorted, it checks if the current element and the previous one are out of order and if the previous element is at least 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it replaces the previous element with its digits.

3. **Digit Insertion**:
   - The program uses integer division (`//`) and modulo (`%`) operations to split a number into its digits.
   - It inserts the tens digit at the current position and the units digit at the next position.

4. **Sorting Check**:
   - The program uses the `func_1` function to check if the array is sorted.
   - `func_1` sorts the list and compares it to the original list to determine if it is sorted.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing each test case, the program prints "Yes" if the array is sorted, otherwise "No".

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Loop Logic**:
   - The loop iterates over the array, but the condition to perform the operation is checked only after the first iteration (due to `p - 1`).
   - The program does not ensure that the entire array is checked and modified until it is sorted or no further modifications can be made.
   - The program does not handle cases where multiple splits are needed in sequence.

2. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**:
   - The program splits numbers into two digits using `// 10` and `% 10`, which is incorrect for numbers greater than or equal to 100.
   - The program should convert the number to a string and then insert each digit individually.

3. **Infinite Loop Possibility**:
   - If the array cannot be sorted by splitting, the program might enter an infinite loop as it does not handle the case where no further splits can be made.

4. **Sorting Check Timing**:
   - The program checks if the array is sorted after each split, but it should continue to check and modify the array until no further splits are needed or the array is sorted.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the program's logic, it is not guaranteed to correctly determine if the array can be sorted by performing the described operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
