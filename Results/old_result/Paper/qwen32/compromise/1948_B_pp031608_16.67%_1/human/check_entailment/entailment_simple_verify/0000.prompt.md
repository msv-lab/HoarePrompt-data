You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers representing the elements of the array a, where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99, and the length of lst, n, satisfies 2 <= n <= 50. Additionally, the function will be called multiple times (1 <= t <= 10^3) with different such lists.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns True if the list `lst` is already sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise it returns False.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the operations described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Logic Error in Splitting Numbers**:
   - The program attempts to split a number if it is greater than 10 and the previous number is greater than the current number. However, this logic is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of needing to split multiple numbers or numbers that are not adjacent to the current number.
   - The program only checks the previous number, but the problem allows splitting any number that is at least 10, regardless of its position.

2. **Inadequate Handling of Multiple Splits**:
   - The program only performs a single split operation per iteration of the outer loop. This is insufficient, as multiple splits might be needed to sort the array.

3. **Incorrect Placement of Split Digits**:
   - The program incorrectly inserts the digits of the split number. For example, if the number 12 is split, it should be replaced by the digits 1 and 2, but the current logic incorrectly places the digits in the wrong positions.

4. **Lack of Proper Loop Control**:
   - The program does not ensure that the entire array is checked and modified until it is sorted or no further splits are possible.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
4
30 2 10 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation:**
- Split 30 into 3 and 0, resulting in [3, 0, 2, 10, 5].
- Split 10 into 1 and 0, resulting in [3, 0, 2, 1, 0, 5].
- The array can then be sorted to [0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5].

However, the current program would not handle this case correctly because it does not perform enough splits or handle the splits correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
