Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Key Points of the Problem:
1. **Operation**: For any element in the array that is at least 10, it can be split into its individual digits and inserted back into the array in the same position.
2. **Objective**: Determine if it's possible to transform the array into a non-decreasing order using the above operation.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates over the array starting from the second element.
   - It checks if the array is sorted using the `func_1` function.
   - If the array is not sorted and the current element is greater than the previous one and greater than 10, it attempts to split the previous element.
   - The split operation is performed by removing the previous element and inserting its digits back into the array.

3. **Checking Sorted Order**:
   - After attempting to sort the array, the program checks if the array is sorted using the `func_1` function.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting**:
   - The program only considers splitting the previous element if it is greater than the current element and greater than 10.
   - This logic is flawed because it only attempts to split once and does not handle cases where multiple splits are needed or where the current element is less than the previous one.

2. **Inefficient Approach**:
   - The program does not consider all possible splits and their effects on the array.
   - It only checks the immediate neighbors, which is insufficient to determine if the array can be sorted through any number of splits.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the list is sorted, but it is not used effectively in the main logic.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted through the described operations. It fails to handle all possible scenarios and does not guarantee that the array will be checked in a way that considers all possible splits.

**Correctness: False**
