The code snippet `bonuses = list(func_2())` updates the `bonuses` variable by assigning it the list returned by the function `func_2()`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `combined` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice (where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`), `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is the maximum profit achieved, `current_profit` is the profit after processing all items, `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.`**
