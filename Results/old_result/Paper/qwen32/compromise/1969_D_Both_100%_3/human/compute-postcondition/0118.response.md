Output State: **`heap` contains all the original elements except the smallest one, plus `item`; `removed_item` holds the smallest element that was just popped from the heap; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the initial value minus the number of iterations; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `combined` is not empty (unless it had only one element, in which case it is now empty); `item` is the last element that was popped from `combined`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. If `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of `removed_item`.**

Explanation: The `combined` list loses its last element, which is now stored in the variable `item`. All other variables retain their previous values unless further operations are specified in subsequent code.
