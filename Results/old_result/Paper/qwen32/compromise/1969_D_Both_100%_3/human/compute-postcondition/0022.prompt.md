Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` paired together, sorted by the `bonuses` values, and `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(k):
    if combined:
        heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `heap` contains the last tuple from the original `combined` list if `combined` was non-empty; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()` and must be greater than 0; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is 0; `current_profit` is 0; `combined` is a list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` paired together, sorted by the `bonuses` values, and may have one less tuple if `combined` was non-empty; `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `heap` contains the last tuple from the original `combined` list if `combined` was non-empty, now it contains the tuple that was the last in `combined` after popping if `combined` was non-empty. `remaining_items` is an empty list. `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`. `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()` and must be greater than 0. `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`. `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `max_profit` is 0. `current_profit` is 0. `combined` is a list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` paired together, sorted by the `bonuses` values, and now has one less tuple if it was non-empty. `test_cases` must be greater than 0. If `combined` was empty, none of these changes occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `heap` contains the last tuple from the original `combined` list if `combined` was non-empty, now it contains the tuple that was the second-to-last in `combined` after popping if `combined` was non-empty. `remaining_items` is an empty list. `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`. `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()` minus 1 and must be greater than 0. `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`. `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `max_profit` is 0. `current_profit` is 0. `combined` is a list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` paired together, sorted by the `bonuses` values, and now has one less tuple if it was non-empty. `test_cases` must be greater than 0. If `combined` was empty, none of these changes occur.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
