In the given for loop, the loop head only contains the variable `_` which is a throwaway variable indicating the number of iterations. The loop will execute `k` times, where `k` is a predefined variable. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `k`.

Since the loop iterates `k` times, at the start of each iteration, `k` remains unchanged but the internal counter for the loop (which is not explicitly shown in the loop head) decreases by 1. However, since we are only concerned with the variables in the loop head, no change is needed to `k` itself.

Given the information, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop does not require any changes to `k` or any other variables outside the loop head.

State: **`heap` contains the last element that was in `combined` plus any previous elements if `combined` was not empty. `combined` has one less element than before if `combined` was not empty. `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`. `k` is greater than 0. `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `neg_prices` is the list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, specifically `neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]`. `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `test_cases` is one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration. `item` is the last element that was popped from `combined` during the last iteration if `combined` was not empty. `current_profit` is 0. `max_profit` is 0. `remaining_items` is an empty list. If `combined` was empty, none of these changes occur.**
