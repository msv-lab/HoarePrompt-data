Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: heap is an empty list; removed_item holds the smallest item that was just popped from the heap during the last iteration; n is the first value returned by `func_2()`; k is the second value returned by `func_2()`; prices is the list returned by `func_2()`; neg_prices is the list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, specifically `neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]`; bonuses is the list returned by `func_2()`; test_cases is one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration; combined is a list of tuples where each tuple contains corresponding elements from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple; item is the last element that was popped from `combined` during the last iteration; current_profit is 0; max_profit is 0; remaining_items is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(k):
    if combined:
        heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `heap` is an empty list unless `combined` was not empty, in which case `heap` contains the last element that was in `combined`. `combined` has one less element than before if `combined` was not empty. `removed_item` holds the smallest item that was just popped from the heap during the last iteration if `combined` was not empty. `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`. `k` is greater than 0. `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `neg_prices` is the list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, specifically `neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]`. `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `test_cases` is one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration. `item` is the last element that was popped from `combined` during the last iteration if `combined` was not empty. `current_profit` is 0. `max_profit` is 0. `remaining_items` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `heap` contains the last element that was in `combined` plus any previous elements if `combined` was not empty. `combined` has one less element than before if `combined` was not empty. `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`. `k` is greater than 0. `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `neg_prices` is the list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, specifically `neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]`. `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `test_cases` is one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration. `item` is the last element that was popped from `combined` during the last iteration if `combined` was not empty. `current_profit` is 0. `max_profit` is 0. `remaining_items` is an empty list. If `combined` was empty, none of these changes occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `heap` contains the last element that was in `combined` plus any previous elements it had; `combined` has one less element than before if it was not empty; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is greater than 0; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is the list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, specifically `neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `item` is the last element that was popped from `combined` during the last iteration if `combined` was not empty; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0; `remaining_items` is an empty list. If `combined` was empty, none of these changes occur.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
