The code sorts the `combined` list based on the second element of each tuple. This means that the order of the tuples in `combined` will change such that they are sorted by their bonus values (since the key used for sorting is `item[1]`).

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `combined`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice (where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`), `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.`**

In simpler terms: The `combined` list is now sorted by the bonus values, while all other variables retain their original values.
