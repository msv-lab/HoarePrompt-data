The code sorts the `combined` list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple (which corresponds to the `bonuses` values). This operation does not affect any other variables except for the order of elements within the `combined` list.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` paired together, sorted by the `bonuses` values, and `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**

In simpler terms: The `combined` list is now sorted by the `bonuses` values, while all other variables remain unchanged.
