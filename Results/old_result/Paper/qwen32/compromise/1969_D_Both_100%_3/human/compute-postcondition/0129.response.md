The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times (`test_cases`). Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `test_cases` itself.

At the end of the previous iteration, `test_cases` is one less than its value at the beginning of that iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must be decremented by 1 again, meaning it should be one more than its current value.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **heap contains the last `k` items processed, `removed_item` holds the smallest item that was just popped from the heap during the last iteration, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is `0`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is the list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `combined` is an empty list, `item` is the last element that was popped from `combined` during the last iteration, `current_profit` reflects the final profit after all iterations, and `max_profit` reflects the maximum profit encountered during the iterations.**
