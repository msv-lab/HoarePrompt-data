Output State: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements that were in `combined` (or all elements of `combined` if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements), excluding the smallest element, and excluding the item that was just popped from `combined`; `combined` contains at least one element less than before; `item` holds the value of the last element that was in `combined` before it was popped; `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `removed_item`, and `max_profit` remain unchanged; `current_profit` is decreased by the value of `item[1]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `current_profit` has been reduced by the second element of the `item` tuple. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
