The code snippet creates a list of tuples called `combined` by zipping together the elements of `neg_prices` and `bonuses`. This means each tuple in `combined` will contain one element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `combined`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` paired together, and `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**
