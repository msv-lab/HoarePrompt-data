The code snippet reassigns the `prices` variable to a new list returned by the function `func_2()`. This means the previous value of `prices` (which was also a list returned by `func_2()`) is replaced with the new list.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `combined` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is the maximum profit achieved, `current_profit` is the profit after processing all items, `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

In simpler terms, the `prices` list has been updated to the latest list returned by `func_2()`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
