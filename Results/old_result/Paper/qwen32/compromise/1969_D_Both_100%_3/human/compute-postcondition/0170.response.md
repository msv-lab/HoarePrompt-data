Postcondition: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements that were in `combined` (or all elements of `combined` if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements), excluding the smallest element, and including `item`; `combined` is either empty or contains the original elements minus the last one; `item` holds the value of the last element that was in `combined`; `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `removed_item` remain unchanged; `current_profit` remains unchanged; `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`.**
