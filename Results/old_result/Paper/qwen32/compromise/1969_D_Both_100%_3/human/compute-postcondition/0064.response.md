To determine what will be printed when the `print(max_profit)` statement executes, let's analyze the given initial state and the context:

- `heap` contains the last `k` processed items.
- `combined` is an empty list.
- `remaining_items` is an empty list.
- `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, which likely represents the total number of items.
- `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, which likely represents the number of items to keep in the heap.
- `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, which contains the prices of the items.
- `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice.
- `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, which likely contains bonuses associated with the items.
- `max_profit` is the maximum profit achieved.
- `current_profit` is the profit after processing all items.
- `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

Given these details, the `max_profit` variable holds the maximum profit that has been calculated based on the processing logic involving `heap`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses`.

Since the exact values of `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` are not provided, and the specific logic for calculating `max_profit` is not detailed, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `max_profit`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated `max_profit`.

Output: **max_profit (where max_profit is the maximum profit achieved based on the processing logic involving heap, prices, neg_prices, and bonuses)**
