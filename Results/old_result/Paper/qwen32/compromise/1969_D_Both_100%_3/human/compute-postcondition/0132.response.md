Output State: **heap is an empty list; removed_item holds the smallest item that was just popped from the heap during the last iteration; n is the first value returned by `func_2()`; k is the second value returned by `func_2()`; prices is the list returned by `func_2()`; neg_prices is the list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice; bonuses is the list returned by `func_2()`; test_cases is one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration; combined is an empty list; item is the last element that was popped from `combined` during the last iteration; current_profit reflects the final profit after all iterations; max_profit reflects the maximum profit encountered during the iterations; remaining_items is an empty list.**

Explanation: The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_2()`. All other variables remain unchanged.
