Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `heap` contains the last `k` elements of the original `combined` list (or all elements if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements). If `combined` is not empty, it indicates that `combined` originally had fewer than `k` elements, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the initial value minus the number of iterations (which is `0` if all iterations were completed), `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. `current_profit` retains its value. `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration in both cases.
Code of the loop:
while combined:
    item = combined.pop()
    if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
        current_profit -= item[1]
    else:
        current_profit += item[0]
    removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
    if removed_item:
        current_profit -= removed_item[0]
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `heap` contains `item` and the smallest element has been removed; `removed_item` holds the smallest element that was removed from the heap; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the initial value minus the number of iterations; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `combined` is an empty list; `item` is `some_value`. If `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is reduced by `removed_item[0]`. Additionally, if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `heap` contains all the original elements except the smallest one, plus `item`; `removed_item` holds the smallest element that was just popped from the heap; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the initial value minus the number of iterations; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `combined` is not empty but has one less element; `item` is the last element that was popped from `combined`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. If `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of `removed_item`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `heap` contains all the original elements except the smallest one, plus `item`, minus the smallest element; `removed_item` holds the smallest element that was just popped from the heap; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the initial value minus the number of iterations; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `combined` is not empty (unless it had only one element, in which case it is now empty); `item` is the last element that was popped from `combined`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
