The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` performs two main operations:
1. It pops the last element from the `combined` list.
2. It pushes this popped element into the `heap`.

Given the initial state, `combined` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple. After popping the last element from `combined`, the `combined` list will have one less element. The popped element is then pushed into the `heap`, which means the `heap` will now contain one more element.

Since `heap` was initially an empty list, after the operation, it will contain the last element of the `combined` list. The `combined` list will no longer include the last element that was popped.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`heap` contains the last element that was in `combined`; `combined` has one less element than before; `removed_item` holds the smallest item that was just popped from the heap during the last iteration; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` must be greater than 0; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is the list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, specifically `neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `item` is the last element that was popped from `combined` during the last iteration, `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list.**
