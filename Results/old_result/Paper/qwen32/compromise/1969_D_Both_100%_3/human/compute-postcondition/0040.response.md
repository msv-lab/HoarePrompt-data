Postcondition: **`heap` contains `item` instead of the smallest element it previously contained; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before `item` was pushed. If `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of `removed_item`. `combined` is not empty but has one less element than before; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice (each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`), `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` since `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`; `test_cases` must be greater than 0; `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`.**
