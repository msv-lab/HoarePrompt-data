The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` removes the last tuple from the `combined` list (since `pop()` without an index removes the last element) and pushes it onto the `heap`. This means that the `heap` will now contain one more element, and the `combined` list will have one less element.

Given the initial state, `heap` was an empty list, and `combined` was a non-empty list of tuples. After executing the code, `heap` will contain the last tuple from `combined`, and `combined` will no longer have that tuple.

Output State: **`heap` contains the last tuple from the original `combined` list; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()` and must be greater than 0; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is 0; `current_profit` is 0; `combined` is a non-empty list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` paired together, sorted by the `bonuses` values, with one less tuple than before; `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**
