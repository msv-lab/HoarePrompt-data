The code snippet provided increments the variable `o_l` by 1. No other variables are altered by this statement.

Given the initial state, `o_l` is incremented by 1, meaning if `o_l` was initially `x`, it will now be `x + 1`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string with at least one character, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least one integer, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `i` is `arr[pos]`, `z_l` and `z_r` are counts related to 0s, `o_l` is incremented by 1, `o_r` and `z_r` are counts related to 1s and 0s respectively, `dist`, `b_d`, and `ans` are adjusted based on the new value of `i`, `pos` is increased by 1.**
