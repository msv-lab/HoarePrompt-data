Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is updated to the input string; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string`; `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`; `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr`; `z_l` is 0; `o_l` is 0; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `ans` is 0; `pos` is 0; `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)` if `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, otherwise `b_d` is 30001.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string that can be converted to a list with at least one integer, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` with at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`. If `i` is 0, then `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr` minus 1, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 0. Otherwise, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr` minus 1, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 1. In both cases, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 1, and `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - pos)` if `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, otherwise `b_d` is 30001`. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is set to `pos`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string that can be converted to a list with at least one integer, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` with at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is incremented by 1, `z_l` is incremented by 1 and `z_r` is decremented by 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is incremented by 1 and `o_r` is decremented by 1. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is equal to `pos` and `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string that can be converted to a list with at least one integer, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` with at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `i` is the element at position `pos` in `arr`, `pos` is incremented by 1. If `i` was 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is incremented by 1 and `o_r` is decremented by 1. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `(b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))`, then `ans` is equal to `pos` and `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
