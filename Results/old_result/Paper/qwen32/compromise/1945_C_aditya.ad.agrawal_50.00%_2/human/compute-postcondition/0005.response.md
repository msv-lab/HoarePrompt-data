Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is an input string; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting a character from `input_string` to an integer; `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`.**

Natural Language: The variable `z` is now assigned the value representing the number of times the integer 0 appears in the list `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `input_string`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
