Postcondition: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new input string, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is 1, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr` minus 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr` minus 1 if `i` is not 0, otherwise `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 1. Additionally, `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2` when `i` is not 0, or `(z_r + o_r + 1) / 2` when `i` is 0, `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d` is greater than `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.**
