Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string with at least one character, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least one integer, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `i` is `arr[pos]`, `pos` is increased by 1, `dist`, `z_l`, `z_r`, `o_l`, `o_r`, and `ans` are adjusted based on the new value of `i`. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is incremented by 1 and `o_r` is decremented by 1. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `(b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))`, then `ans` is now equal to `pos` and `b_d` is now equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.**
