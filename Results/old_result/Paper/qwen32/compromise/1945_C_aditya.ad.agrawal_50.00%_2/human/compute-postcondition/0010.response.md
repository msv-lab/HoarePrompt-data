The code snippet provided only assigns the value `0` to the variable `o_l`. None of the other variables are modified. Therefore, the output state reflects this change while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is an input string; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting a character from `input_string` to an integer; `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`; `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o_r` is equal to `o`; `z_l` is 0; `o_l` is 0.**
