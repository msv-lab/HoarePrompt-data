Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases, and `cas_de_test`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers representing the scores of the three players in each test case. The function returns a list `resultats` containing the results of each test case after processing all the test cases.**
