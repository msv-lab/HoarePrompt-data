Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Grid and Diagonals**: 
   - We have a square grid of size `n x n`.
   - The total number of diagonals in this grid is `4n - 2`. These diagonals include both main and anti-diagonals of various lengths.

2. **Objective**:
   - Sasha wants to color the minimum number of cells such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - For the `n x n` grid, there are `2n - 1` diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right (main diagonals) and `2n - 1` diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left (anti-diagonals).
   - The longest diagonals in the grid have `n` cells, and the shortest diagonals have `1` cell.
   - To minimize the number of colored cells while covering the required number of diagonals, it's optimal to color cells in such a way that each colored cell covers as many diagonals as possible.

4. **Strategy**:
   - If `k` is equal to the total number of diagonals (`4n - 2`), then we need to color all diagonals. Since each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal), we need to color `ceil((4n - 2) / 2)` cells. This simplifies to `2n - 1` cells.
   - If `k` is less than `4n - 2`, we need to find the minimum number of cells such that at least `k` diagonals are covered. It can be shown that to cover `k` diagonals, we need to color `ceil(k / 2)` cells. This is because each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals.

### Program Analysis:

The provided solution follows the above strategy:

- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
- If `k` is equal to the total number of diagonals (`4n - 2`), it prints `(k // 2) + 1`.
- Otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`.

However, there's a mistake in the implementation of the first condition. When `k` is equal to `4n - 2`, the correct number of cells to color is `2n - 1`, not `(k // 2) + 1`.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because it incorrectly calculates the number of cells to color when `k` is equal to `4n - 2`. The correct implementation should be:

```python
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(2 * n - 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))

func()
```

Thus, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
