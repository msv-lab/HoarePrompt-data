Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. For each of the `t` test cases, `a`, `b`, and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b`, `m` <= 10^18.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. The constraints on `t` remain the same. The initial conditions for `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case are still valid and unchanged.
