### Reasoning

The original assessment is correct. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have two installations launching fireworks at different frequencies (`a` and `b` minutes).
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky simultaneously.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `a`, `b`, and `m`.
   - It calculates `A` as `int(m / a) + 1` and `B` as `int(m / b) + 1`.
   - It prints `A + B`.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary correctly describes the behavior of the program. It calculates the number of fireworks visible from each installation independently and sums them up.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the program: it does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations.
   - The example provided in the original assessment illustrates this flaw perfectly:
     - For the input `6 7 4`, the program calculates:
       - `A = int(4 / 6) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`
       - `B = int(4 / 7) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`
       - The program outputs `A + B = 2 + 1 = 3`.
     - However, the correct output should be `2` because at time `0`, both fireworks are visible, but they should be counted as one simultaneous event, not two.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program is incorrect because it does not handle the overlap of fireworks from both installations correctly. The original assessment accurately points out this flaw and provides a clear example to demonstrate it.
