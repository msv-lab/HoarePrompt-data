The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state describes the values of `t`, `n`, and `m`, but these values do not affect the output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` and will always output the string `'No'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `m`, but none of these variables are used within the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output of the code will be:
Output: **No**
