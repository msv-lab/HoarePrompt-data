Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, with `n` and `m` being the values from the most recent line of input.**

Explanation: The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The values of `n` and `m` are updated to be the integers from the most recent line of input.
