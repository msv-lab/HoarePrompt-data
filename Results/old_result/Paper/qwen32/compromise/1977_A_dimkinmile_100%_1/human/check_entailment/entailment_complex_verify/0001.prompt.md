You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if ((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, with `n` and `m` being the values from the most recent line of input. The difference between `n` and `m` is either even and non-negative, or not divisible by 2, or less than 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers `n` and `m` from each of `t` lines of input, where `1 <= t <= 100` and `1 <= n, m <= 100`. For each pair of integers, it prints "Yes" if the difference `n - m` is even and non-negative, otherwise it prints "No".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem as described. The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube in each move. We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

The key observation is that each move either increases or decreases the number of cubes by 1. Therefore, after `n` moves, the difference between the number of cubes we end up with (`m`) and the number of cubes we start with (0) must be an integer that can be achieved by a combination of adding and removing cubes.

Since the starting number of cubes is 0, the difference `n - m` must be even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and an even number of moves is required to achieve an even difference. Additionally, `n - m` must be non-negative because you can't have more cubes than moves.

The program correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n` (number of moves) and `m` (desired number of cubes).
- It checks if `n - m` is even and non-negative.
- If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

Thus, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
