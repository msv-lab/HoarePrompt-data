### Reasoning:
To determine if the program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic used in the program matches the problem requirements.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. This means after `n` moves, the net change in the number of cubes in the tower can be any even number between `-n` and `n` (inclusive), since each move either adds or subtracts one cube, and the sum of an even number of such moves will be even.

The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` in the program checks two things:
1. `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even, which is necessary for the net effect of the moves to result in exactly `m` cubes.
2. `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves `n` is at least as large as the number of cubes `m` desired in the final tower, which is necessary because Nikita can't end up with more cubes than the number of moves he has made.

However, the second condition `n - m >= 0` is not sufficient on its own. Nikita could still end up with `m` cubes even if `m > n` by first adding cubes and then removing some. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 3`, Nikita could add 3 cubes and then remove 2 cubes, resulting in a tower of 3 cubes. Therefore, the correct condition should only check if `n - m` is even.

The correct condition should be just `(n - m) % 2 == 0` without the `n - m >= 0` part. With the current condition, the program will incorrectly return "No" for cases where `m > n` but `n - m` is even.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it incorrectly rejects cases where `m > n` but `n - m` is even. The correct logic should only check if `n - m` is even.
