### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining whether it's possible to end up with a tower of `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube.

The core logic of the solution hinges on the difference `n - m`. The key points are:
1. **Even Difference**: If `n - m` is even, it means that the total number of moves `n` can be split into pairs where each pair consists of adding and removing a cube, which results in no net change. This allows for the possibility of reaching `m` cubes from `0` cubes.
2. **Non-negative Difference**: If `n - m` is non-negative, it means that the number of moves `n` is sufficient to reach `m` cubes, even if we need to remove some cubes (which can be compensated by adding cubes first).

The function `func_1` correctly implements this logic by checking if `n - m` is even and non-negative. If both conditions are met, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Correctness:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have a tower of `m` cubes after `n` moves. Given the constraints and the logic, the program will produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

**Correctness: True**
