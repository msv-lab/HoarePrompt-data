Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the problem and the program step-by-step to confirm this.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Initial State**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Moves**: In each move, Nikita can either add or remove exactly 1 cube.
3. **Objective**: Determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Key Observations:
- Each move changes the number of cubes by ±1.
- To end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, the net change in the number of cubes should be `m`.
- Since each move changes the count by 1, the net change (i.e., `m`) must be achievable by a combination of adding and removing cubes.
- The net change must be an even number because each move affects the count by 1, and an even number of such moves is required to achieve an even net change.
- Additionally, the number of moves `n` must be at least as large as the absolute value of the net change `m` because you can't have more cubes than moves.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`. It then checks if `n - m` is even and non-negative. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

- **Condition Analysis**:
  - **Even Difference**: `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the net change is even.
  - **Non-negative Difference**: `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves is sufficient to achieve the desired number of cubes.

### Validation:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 3`, `m = 3`
  - `n - m = 0` (even and non-negative) → Output: "Yes"
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 2`, `m = 4`
  - `n - m = -2` (even but negative) → Output: "No"
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 5`, `m = 3`
  - `n - m = 2` (even and non-negative) → Output: "Yes"

The logic in the program aligns perfectly with the problem requirements and correctly determines whether the desired number of cubes can be achieved after the given number of moves.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate, and the program correctly solves the problem as described.

Final: **True**
