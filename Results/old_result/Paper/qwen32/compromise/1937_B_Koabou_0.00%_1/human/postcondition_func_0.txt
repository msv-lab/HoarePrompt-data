The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. It constructs a new binary string `s` by finding the first position where the second string has a '1' and the first string has a '0', and then combines parts of the two strings. It also calculates an integer `t` based on the constructed string `s` and the first string. The function prints the constructed string `s` and the integer `t`.
