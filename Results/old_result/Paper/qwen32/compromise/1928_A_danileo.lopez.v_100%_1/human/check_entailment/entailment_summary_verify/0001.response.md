### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program based on the function summary and the original assessment.

**Problem Analysis:**
- Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b`.
- He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
- He then tries to form another rectangle from these two smaller rectangles.
- Two rectangles are considered the same if one is a 90-degree rotation of the other.
- We need to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

**Key Points:**
- If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of equal size along the even dimension.
- If `a` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two `a/2 x b` rectangles.
- If `b` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two `a x b/2` rectangles.
- After cutting, Bob can form a new rectangle by placing the two smaller rectangles side by side or one on top of the other.
- The new rectangle should have different dimensions compared to the original `a x b` rectangle when ignoring rotations.

**Program Analysis:**
- The program reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b`.
- It checks if either `a` or `b` is even.
- If `a` is even, it calculates two `a/2 x b` rectangles and checks if `a/2` is not equal to `b`.
- If `b` is even, it calculates two `a x b/2` rectangles and checks if `b/2` is not equal to `a`.
- If either condition is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

**Issues in the Program:**
- The program does not correctly handle the case where both `a` and `b` are even. It only checks one of the even conditions and prints "Yes" if that condition is met, even if the resulting rectangle has the same dimensions as the original when rotated.
- Specifically, if both `a` and `b` are even, Bob can always form a new rectangle with different dimensions by rearranging the smaller rectangles.

**Function Summary Analysis:**
- The function summary correctly states that the function checks if either `a` or `b` can be split into two equal parts such that neither part equals the other integer.
- However, it does not explicitly mention the case where both `a` and `b` are even, which should always result in "Yes".

**Correctness:**
- The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are even correctly.
- For example, a `4 x 4` rectangle can be cut into two `4 x 2` rectangles, and then these can be rearranged to form a `2 x 8` rectangle, which is different from `4 x 4`. However, the program will print "No" for a `4 x 4` rectangle because it only checks one of the even conditions.

**Conclusion:**
The provided program is indeed incorrect because it does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are even correctly.

### Final: **False**
