The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then prints "Yes" if either `a` or `b` can be split into two equal parts such that neither part equals the other integer, otherwise it prints "No". The function outputs `t` lines, each being either "Yes" or "No", depending on the values of `a` and `b` for each test case.
