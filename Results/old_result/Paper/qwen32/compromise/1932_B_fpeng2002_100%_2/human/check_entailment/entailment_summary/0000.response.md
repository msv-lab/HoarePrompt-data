Reasoning:
The given Python program is intended to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur based on the periodicities of the signs. The program iteratively calculates the next occurrence of each sign starting from the year after the previous sign's occurrence.

The key part of the program is the line:
```python
start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
```
This line calculates the next occurrence of the current sign (`nums[x]`) starting from `start_year + 1`. It effectively computes the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.

Let's break down the logic with the example provided:

1. For the first test case:
   - `n = 6`
   - `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
   - Iteration 1 (`x = 0`): `start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3` (first sign occurs in year 3)
   - Iteration 2 (`x = 1`): `start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4` (second sign occurs in year 4)
   - Iteration 3 (`x = 2`): `start_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8` (third sign occurs in year 8)
   - Iteration 4 (`x = 3`): `start_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10` (fourth sign occurs in year 10)
   - Iteration 5 (`x = 4`): `start_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18` (fifth sign occurs in year 18)
   - Iteration 6 (`x = 5`): `start_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36` (sixth sign occurs in year 36)

The output for this test case is 36, which matches the expected result.

The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement and produces the correct output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
