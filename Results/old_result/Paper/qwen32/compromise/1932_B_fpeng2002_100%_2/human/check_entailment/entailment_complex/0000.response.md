Reasoning:
The program provided is intended to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, and thus the apocalypse happens, based on the periodicity of each sign. The logic in the program, however, does not correctly compute the year for the n-th sign to occur sequentially as described in the problem statement.

The given program iterates through the list of periodicities and calculates `start_year` as `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each sign. This formula actually calculates the next occurrence of the i-th sign starting from `start_year`, but it does not ensure that the signs occur sequentially as required by the problem statement.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
1. Initialize `start_year` to 0.
2. For each sign, find the next occurrence of that sign after `start_year` and update `start_year` to that year.
3. Repeat step 2 for all signs.

The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` correctly finds the next occurrence of the i-th sign after `start_year`, which is what the program does. However, the description provided in the comments is misleading because it incorrectly states that `start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all the integers in the `nums` list, which is not the case.

The program actually performs the correct calculations based on the problem statement, so the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
