The code modifies the value of `start_year` based on the current value of `start_year`, `nums`, and `x`. Given that `start_year` is initially `2 * nums[1]` and `x` is `2`, the new value of `start_year` is calculated as `(start_year // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `start_year // nums[2]` performs integer division of `start_year` by `nums[2]`.
- Adding `1` to the result of the integer division.
- Multiplying the result by `nums[2]` to get the new `start_year`.

The values of `t`, `num_tests`, `n`, and `nums` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is a positive integer and is now reduced by 1 from its initial value; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must have at least 1 integer; `start_year` is `(2 * nums[1] // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`; `x` is 2.**
