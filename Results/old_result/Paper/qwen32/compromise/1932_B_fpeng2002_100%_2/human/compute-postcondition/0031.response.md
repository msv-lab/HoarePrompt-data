The code `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` by reading an integer from the input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is at least 0; `n` is the input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers; `start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all the integers in the `nums` list.**
