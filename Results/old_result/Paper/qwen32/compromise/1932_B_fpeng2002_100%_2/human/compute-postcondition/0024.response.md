Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is now `num_tests - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and has at least one integer; `start_year` is `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`; `x` is `x + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `start_year` is recalculated as `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, and `x` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
