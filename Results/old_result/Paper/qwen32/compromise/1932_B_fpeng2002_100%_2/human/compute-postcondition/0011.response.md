The only variables in the loop head are `x` and the length of `nums`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x` and the length of `nums`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1, and `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer. For the loop to execute again, `x` should be incremented by 1, and the length of `nums` should remain the same or greater than the new value of `x`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is a positive integer and is now reduced by 1 from its initial value; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must have at least 1 integer; `start_year` is `2 * nums[1]`; `x` is 2**
