The code modifies the value of `start_year` based on the current value of `x` and the list `nums`. Specifically, `start_year` is recalculated as `((start_year // nums[x]) + 1) * nums[x]`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `num_tests` is at least 0.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer.
- `x` is `x + 1`.

After the execution of the code, the value of `start_year` changes, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `num_tests` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `x` is `x + 1`, `start_year` is `((start_year // nums[x]) + 1) * nums[x]`.**
