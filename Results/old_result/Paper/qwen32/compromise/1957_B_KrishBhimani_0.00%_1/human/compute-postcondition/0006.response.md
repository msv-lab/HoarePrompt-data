To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `while k:`. The loop will execute if `k` is truthy, meaning `k` must be a non-zero integer.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
- `arr` is an empty list.
- `k0` is equal to `k`.
- `i` is 0.

The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we need to ensure that `k` is non-zero for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute if `k` is non-zero.
2. **Adjust the state of `k`**: Since `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, we need to ensure that this value is non-zero.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, `k` must be a non-zero integer. Given that `k` is derived from the second element of `l1`, we need to specify that this element must be a non-zero integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace where the second element must be a non-zero integer; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `i` is 0**
