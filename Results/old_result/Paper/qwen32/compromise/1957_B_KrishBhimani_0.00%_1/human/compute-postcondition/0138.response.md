To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the given loop and the provided output states after the first 3 iterations.

The loop iterates over the indices of set bits in the integer `k`. For each iteration:
- It checks if `c` (the iteration count) is equal to `n - 1`. If true, it appends `k0 - sum(ans)` to `ans` and breaks out of the loop.
- Otherwise, it appends `1 << i` to `ans` and increments `c` by 1.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations:
1. After the first iteration, `ans` contains `[1 << arr[0]]`.
2. After the second iteration, `ans` contains `[1 << arr[0], 1 << arr[1]]`.
3. After the third iteration, `ans` contains `[1 << arr[0], 1 << arr[1], 1 << arr[2]]`. If `c` equals `n - 1` after this iteration, `ans` would also include `k0 - sum(ans)` and the loop would terminate.

The loop will terminate either after `n` iterations or when `c` reaches `n - 1`. The final state of `ans` will be a list containing up to `n` elements, where each element is `1 << i` for the corresponding set bit index `i` in `arr`. If the loop completes `n` iterations without `c` reaching `n - 1`, it will simply have `n` elements in `ans`. If `c` reaches `n - 1` before `n` iterations, the final element will be `k0 - sum(ans)`.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations of the loop can be described as follows:

- `ans` will contain up to `n` elements, where each element is `1 << i` for the corresponding set bit index `i` in `arr`.
- If `c` reaches `n - 1` before `n` iterations, the last element in `ans` will be `k0 - sum(ans)`.

Given the format requirement, the final output state is:

Output State: **`ans` contains up to `n` elements where each element is `1 << i` for the corresponding set bit index `i` in `arr`. If `c` reaches `n - 1` before `n` iterations, the last element in `ans` will be `k0 - sum(ans)`.**
