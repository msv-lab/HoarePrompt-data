Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k0` is at least 4; `k` is the integer value of `k0 // 4` and must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `arr` is `[1, 2]` if `k0` is odd, or `arr` is `[2]` if `k0` is even.**

Explanation: The variable `arr` has been updated to include the value of `i` (which is 2). Therefore, if `k0` was odd, `arr` was initially `[1]` and is now `[1, 2]`. If `k0` was even, `arr` was initially `[]` and is now `[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
