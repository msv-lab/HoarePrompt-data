The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given that the initial state specifies `i` is 2, after executing the code, `i` will be 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is `k >> 1` (which is `k // 2`), `k0` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `ans` is [2, -2], and `c` is 2. If `k` (before the shift) is odd, `arr` is [0, 1, 2]. Otherwise, `arr` is [1, 2].**
