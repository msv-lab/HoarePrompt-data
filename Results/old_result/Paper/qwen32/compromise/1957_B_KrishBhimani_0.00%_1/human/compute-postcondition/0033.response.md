The code snippet appends the result of `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Let's break down the changes:

- `k0` is 1.
- `ans` is either `[1, 2]` or `[2]` depending on the value of `c` before the if statement.
- `sum(ans)` will be `3` if `ans` is `[1, 2]` and `2` if `ans` is `[2]`.

Let's compute the new value to be appended:
- If `ans` is `[1, 2]`, then `sum(ans)` is `3`, and `k0 - sum(ans)` is `1 - 3 = -2`.
- If `ans` is `[2]`, then `sum(ans)` is `2`, and `k0 - sum(ans)` is `1 - 2 = -1`.

So, `ans` will be updated to `[1, 2, -2]` if it was `[1, 2]` before, or `[2, -1]` if it was `[2]` before.

The other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `i`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is 1, `arr` is [0, 1], `i` is 1, `c` is `c + 1`, and `ans` is `[1, 2, -2]` if `c` was `n - 1` before the if statement, otherwise `ans` is `[2, -1]`.**
