The code snippet `k = k >> 1` performs a right bitwise shift on the variable `k`. This operation effectively divides `k` by 2 and truncates the result to an integer (i.e., performs integer division by 2).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace where the second element must be a non-zero integer
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`
- If `k` is odd, `arr` is a list containing the integer 0; otherwise, `arr` remains an empty list
- `k0` is equal to `k`
- `i` is 0

After executing `k = k >> 1`, the value of `k` is updated to `k // 2` (integer division by 2).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace where the second element must be a non-zero integer; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of `k0 // 2`; if `k0` is odd, `arr` is a list containing the integer 0; otherwise, `arr` remains an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k0`; `i` is 0.**
