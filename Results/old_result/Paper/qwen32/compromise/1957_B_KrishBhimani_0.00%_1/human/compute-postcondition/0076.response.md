Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is [0]. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, then `ans` is [k0] and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains [].**
