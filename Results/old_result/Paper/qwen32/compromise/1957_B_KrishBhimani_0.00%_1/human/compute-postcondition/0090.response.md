The code snippet appends `1 << i` to the list `ans`. The value of `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but based on the context, we can infer that `i` is a variable that is used in the bit shift operation. Since the value of `i` is not provided, we will keep it as `i` in the output state.

The other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `arr`, `c`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is `[0, 1]`, `c` is 3, `ans` is a list that includes `1 << i`. If `c` was equal to `n - 1`, `ans` would be `[k0, 1 << i, -(1 << i), 1 << i]` and we would break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `ans` remains as it was before the if statement.**
