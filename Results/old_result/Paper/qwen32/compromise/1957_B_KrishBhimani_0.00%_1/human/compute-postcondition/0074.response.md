The code snippet `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends the value of `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` is an empty list, so `sum(ans)` is 0. Therefore, the value being appended is `k0 - 0`, which is just `k0`.

After this operation, `ans` will contain one element, which is `k0`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is [0], `ans` is [k0], and `c` is equal to `n - 1`.**
