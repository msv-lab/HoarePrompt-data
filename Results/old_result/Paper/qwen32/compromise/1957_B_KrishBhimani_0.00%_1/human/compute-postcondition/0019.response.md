Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k0` is at least 4; `k` is the integer value of `k0 // 4` and must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `arr` is `[1, 2]` if `k` is odd and `k0` is odd, or `arr` is `[2]` if `k` is odd and `k0` is even, or `arr` remains an empty list if `k` is even.**
