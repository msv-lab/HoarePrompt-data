To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to carefully analyze the given loop and the provided states after the first three iterations. Let's break down the behavior of the loop and the variables involved.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over the list `arr`, which contains the indices where the corresponding bits in `k0` are set to 1. The variable `c` keeps track of the number of iterations. The loop appends values to the list `ans` based on the value of `c` and the condition `c == n - 1`.

### Given States
- **After 1 iteration:**
  - `arr` is `[0]`
  - `ans` is `[2]` if `c` was not `n - 1`, or `[1, 2]` if `c` was `n - 1`
  - `c` is incremented by 1

- **After 2 iterations:**
  - `arr` is `[0, 1]`
  - `ans` is `[2, -1, 2]` if `c` was not `n - 1`, or `[1, 2, -2, 2]` if `c` was `n - 1`
  - `c` is incremented by 1

- **After 3 iterations:**
  - `arr` is `[0, 1]`
  - `ans` is `[2, -1, 2, 2]` if `c` was not `n - 1`
  - `c` is incremented by 1

### Key Observations
- The loop will break if `c` equals `n - 1`.
- For `k0 = 1`, `arr` contains only `[0]`.
- For `k0 = 3`, `arr` contains `[0, 1]`.

Given that `arr` is `[0, 1]` after the second iteration, it implies `k0` has at least two bits set to 1. Therefore, the loop will iterate over each bit in `arr`.

### Final State Calculation
Let's assume `k0` has two bits set to 1 (i.e., `k0 = 3`). This means `arr` will be `[0, 1]` and the loop will iterate twice. Since `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, we need to determine `n` to know when the loop breaks.

If `n = 3`:
- After the first iteration: `ans` is `[2]`, `c` is 1
- After the second iteration: `ans` is `[2, 2]`, `c` is 2
- Since `c` is now `n - 1`, the loop breaks and `ans` becomes `[2, 2, -4]`.

If `n = 2`:
- After the first iteration: `ans` is `[2]`, `c` is 1
- Since `c` is now `n - 1`, the loop breaks and `ans` becomes `[2, -2]`.

Given the provided states and the behavior, we can infer that `n` is 2, as the loop breaks after the second iteration.

### Final Output State
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1` (which is 2), `k` is 0, `k0` is 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is [0], `ans` is [2, -2], and `c` is 2.**

In natural language, the final output state is that the list `ans` contains `[2, -2]`, and the loop has completed all its iterations with `c` equal to 2, which matches the condition `n - 1` when `n` is 2.
