The code provided will read a new input line, split it on whitespace, and assign the resulting list to `l1`. This will overwrite the previous value of `l1`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `arr`, `c`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the original `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`, `arr` contains the indices where the bits of some number (not necessarily `k`) were 1, `c` is `n`, `ans` is `[1 << arr[0], 1 << arr[1], ..., 1 << arr[n-1], k0 - sum(ans)]`.**
