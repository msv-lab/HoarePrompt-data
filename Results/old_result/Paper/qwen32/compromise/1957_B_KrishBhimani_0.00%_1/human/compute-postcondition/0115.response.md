The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `i` is 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the original `l1`, `k` is `k // 2` (where `k` was originally an odd number greater than 0), `k0` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`, `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]` if `k` was odd, otherwise `arr` is `[0, 1]`, `c` is `n`, `ans` is `[1 << arr[0], 1 << arr[1], ..., 1 << arr[n-1], k0 - sum(ans)]`, and `i` is 3**.
