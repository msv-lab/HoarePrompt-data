Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` must be at least 1, `k0` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is [2, -2], and `c` is 2. If `k` is odd, then `arr` is [0, 1]. Otherwise, `arr` is [1].**

In simple terms, the value of `arr` has been updated to include the value of `i` (which is 1). All other variables remain unchanged.
