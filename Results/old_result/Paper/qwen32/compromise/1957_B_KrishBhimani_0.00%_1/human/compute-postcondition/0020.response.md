The code `k = k >> 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on the variable `k`, effectively dividing `k` by 2 and discarding the remainder. This operation changes the value of `k`.

Let's break down the possible scenarios based on the initial state:

1. **Initial State:** `k` is the integer value of `k0 // 4` and must be greater than 0.
2. **After `k = k >> 1`:** The value of `k` is now `k // 2` (integer division).

Since the other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k0`, `i`, `arr`) are not modified by this operation, they retain their initial values.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k0` is at least 4; `k` is the integer value of `k0 // 8` and must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `arr` is `[1, 2]` if `k` (before the shift) is odd and `k0` is odd, or `arr` is `[2]` if `k` (before the shift) is odd and `k0` is even, or `arr` remains an empty list if `k` (before the shift) is even.**
