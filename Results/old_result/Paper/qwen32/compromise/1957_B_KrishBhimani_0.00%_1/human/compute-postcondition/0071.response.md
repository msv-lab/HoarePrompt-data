Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the original `k`, `arr` contains the indices where the bits of the original `k` were 1, `ans` is [], and `c` is 0.**

The value of `c` has been changed to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
