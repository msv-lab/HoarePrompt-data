Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable appears to be a loop counter or the number of test cases, but it is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
2. **`l1`**: A list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace.
3. **`n`**: The integer value of the first element of `l1`. This represents the number of elements in `arr` plus one (since `ans` has `n` elements from `arr` and one additional element `k0 - sum(ans)`).
4. **`k`**: Initialized to 0. However, it is not used in the provided code snippet.
5. **`k0`**: The integer value of the second element of `l1`. This is used to calculate the last element of `ans`.
6. **`arr`**: Contains the indices where the bits of some number (not necessarily `k`) were 1. This list determines the positions of the bits that are set to 1 in a binary representation.
7. **`c`**: Set to `n`. This variable is not used in the provided code snippet.
8. **`ans`**: A list constructed as `[1 << arr[0], 1 << arr[1], ..., 1 << arr[n-1], k0 - sum(ans)]`. This list is composed of powers of 2 corresponding to the indices in `arr` and an additional element which is `k0` minus the sum of the previous elements in `ans`.

### Code Analysis:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

### Calculation of `ans`:
- The first `n` elements of `ans` are calculated as \(1 \ll \text{arr}[i]\) for \(i = 0\) to \(n-1\). This means each element is \(2^{\text{arr}[i]}\).
- The last element of `ans` is calculated as \(k0 - \sum(\text{first } n \text{ elements of } \text{ans})\).

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `l1` is `['3', '10']` and `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]` for simplicity:
- `n` would be 3.
- `k0` would be 10.
- The first three elements of `ans` would be:
  - \(1 \ll \text{arr}[0] = 1 \ll 0 = 1\)
  - \(1 \ll \text{arr}[1] = 1 \ll 1 = 2\)
  - \(1 \ll \text{arr}[2] = 1 \ll 2 = 4\)
- The sum of these elements is \(1 + 2 + 4 = 7\).
- The last element of `ans` would be \(k0 - 7 = 10 - 7 = 3\).

Thus, `ans` would be `[1, 2, 4, 3]`.

### General Case:
Given the general form of `ans`, the output will be:
- The first `n` elements are powers of 2 corresponding to the indices in `arr`.
- The last element is `k0` minus the sum of the first `n` elements.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 << arr[0], 1 << arr[1], ..., 1 << arr[n-1], k0 - (1 << arr[0] + 1 << arr[1] + ... + 1 << arr[n-1]) (where each 1 << arr[i] is 2 raised to the power of arr[i] and k0 is the second element of l1)**
