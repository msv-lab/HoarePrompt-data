The code snippet `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the value of `1` left-shifted by `i` bits to the list `ans`. This operation does not affect any other variable except `ans`.

Given the initial state, `ans` includes an additional element `1 << i` after the code is executed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the original `l1`, `k` is an integer with at least one set bit, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`, `arr` is a list containing the indices of the set bits in the original `k`, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `c` is incremented by 1, and `ans` includes an additional element `1 << i`. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` also includes an additional element `k0 - sum(ans)`, and the loop or switch statement is exited. Otherwise, the loop or switch statement continues.**
