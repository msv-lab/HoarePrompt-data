Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the original `l1`, `k` is an integer with at least one set bit, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`, `arr` is a list containing the indices of the set bits in the original `k`, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `c` is incremented by 1, `ans` includes an additional element `1 << i` and an additional element `k0 - sum(ans)`**

Natural Language: The value of `ans` is updated to include an additional element which is `k0 - sum(ans)`. All other variables retain their previous values.
