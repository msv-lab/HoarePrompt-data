The code snippet provided sets the value of `i` to 0. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `i` is 0, `arr` is [], `ans` is [2, -2], and `c` is 2.**
