Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace.
- `n` is 2.
- `k` is 0.
- `k0` is 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `arr` is \([0]\).
- `ans` is \([2, -2]\).
- `c` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*ans)
```

### Explanation:
The `print(*ans)` statement uses the unpacking operator `*` to print the elements of the list `ans` as separate arguments to the `print` function. This means that each element of the list `ans` will be printed on the same line, separated by spaces.

Given that `ans` is \([2, -2]\), the unpacking operator will pass `2` and `-2` as separate arguments to the `print` function.

### Output:
The output will be the elements of the list `ans` printed on the same line, separated by a space.

Output: **2 -2**
