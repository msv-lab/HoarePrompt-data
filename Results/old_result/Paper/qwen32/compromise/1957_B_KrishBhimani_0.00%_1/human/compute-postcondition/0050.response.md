The code snippet `arr = []` reassigns the variable `arr` to an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `k0` is 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is [], `ans` is [2, -2], and `c` is 2.**

In natural language: The variable `arr` is now an empty list, while all other variables retain their initial values.
