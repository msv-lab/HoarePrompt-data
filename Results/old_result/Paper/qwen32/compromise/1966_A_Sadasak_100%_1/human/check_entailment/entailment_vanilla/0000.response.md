Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to minimize the number of cards in hand by repeatedly exchanging `k` cards of the same number for `k-1` cards of any numbers. We need to find the minimum possible number of cards left.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of cards) and `k` (number of cards to exchange).
   - It then reads the list of card numbers.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `k > n`, no operations can be performed, so the program correctly prints `n`.

3. **Core Logic**:
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to create a frequency table of the card numbers.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to limit the frequency of each card to `k`. However, this does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the number of cards.
   - The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table and prints `k-1` if true. This logic is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal way to minimize the number of cards.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem, we need to use the frequencies of each card number and apply the operation to reduce the count of cards optimally.
   - The correct approach would be to use the formula `(count_of_card % (k-1))` for each card and sum these results, adding 1 if the sum is 0 (to handle the case where all cards can be completely removed).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. The core logic is flawed, and the function `func_1` does not serve the purpose intended.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
