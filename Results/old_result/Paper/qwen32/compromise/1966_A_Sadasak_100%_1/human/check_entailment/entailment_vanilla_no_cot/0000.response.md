Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the allowed operations. Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Frequencies**: The function `func_1` is supposed to create a frequency table of the numbers, but it incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`. This is not necessary and does not help in determining the minimum number of cards.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cards**: The program checks if `k` is in the frequency values and prints `k - 1` if it is. This is not a correct approach to solve the problem. The logic should focus on how many groups of `k` cards can be formed for each number and how many cards will be left after performing the operations.

3. **General Approach**: The correct approach should involve calculating the remainder of the frequency of each number when divided by `k`. The sum of these remainders will give the minimum number of cards left because each group of `k` cards can be reduced to `k-1` cards, but you cannot reduce a group smaller than `k`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    freq = {}
    
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards += count % k
    
    if min_cards == 0:
        min_cards = k
    
    print(min_cards)
```

This corrected program calculates the remainder of the frequency of each number when divided by `k` and sums these remainders to get the minimum number of cards that can be left. If the sum of remainders is zero, it means all cards can be grouped into sets of `k` and reduced to `k-1` cards each, but at least one card will be left, hence the result is set to `k`.
