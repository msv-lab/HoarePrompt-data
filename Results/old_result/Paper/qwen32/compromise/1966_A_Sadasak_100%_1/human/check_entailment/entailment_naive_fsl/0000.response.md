Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the described operations. There are several issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Frequencies**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the frequency of each card number, but it incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`. This is not what the problem requires. The frequency should not be capped; it should be the actual count of each card number.
   
2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Minimum Cards**:
   - The code checks if `k` is in the frequency table values and then prints `k - 1` if it is. This is not a correct way to determine the minimum number of cards left. The correct approach involves using the frequencies to determine how many cards can be reduced based on the operations allowed.

3. **No Proper Reduction Logic**:
   - The code does not properly perform the reduction of cards based on the operations described. For example, if there are `x` cards with the same number, and `x >= k`, you can reduce `x` to `x - k + 1` by performing the operation. This logic is not implemented.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def min_cards_left(n, k, nums):
    # Calculate the frequency of each card number
    from collections import Counter
    freq = Counter(nums)
    
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        # For each card number, reduce the count based on the operations
        min_cards += count % (k - 1) if count % (k - 1) != 0 else k - 1
    
    # Ensure that the minimum number of cards is at least 1
    return max(min_cards, 1)

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(min_cards_left(n, k, nums))
```

This corrected version calculates the frequency of each card number and then determines the minimum number of cards left by reducing the counts based on the allowed operations. It ensures that the minimum number of cards is at least 1, as no operations can reduce the count to 0.
