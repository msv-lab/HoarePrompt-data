The code snippet `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `cp` is 0, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than the previous element plus 1, `i` is 2**.
