Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `x` is less than `y` and `x` is not equal to `y`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` is a list with the `i`-th element of `lit` appended to it. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` contains `lit[i]` as its last element. If `lit[i]` is not greater than `y` and `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, then `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. The condition `x < y` remains true, and `x` is less than `lit[i]` which is less than or equal to `y`. If `b` is an empty list, then `x` is `float('inf')` and `y` is `float('inf')`. If `b` is not an empty list, then `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` (before appending) is an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a` (before appending), and `y` is the last element of `b`.**
