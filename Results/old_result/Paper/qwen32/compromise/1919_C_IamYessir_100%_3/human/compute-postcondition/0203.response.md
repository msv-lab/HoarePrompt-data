The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This means that the list `a` will now have one more element, which is `lit[i]`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:
- `a` now includes the new element `lit[i]` at the end of the list.
- `i` is incremented by 1, as specified in the initial state.
- The variables `t`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, `s`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged unless `a` was empty before this operation, in which case `x` would be updated to `lit[i]` because `a` is no longer empty.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers including the new element `lit[i]`, `b` is a list that is modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer incremented based on certain conditions, `i` is incremented by 1. If `b` is empty, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of the list `b`. If `a` had no elements before this operation, `x` is `lit[i]`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of the list `a`.**
