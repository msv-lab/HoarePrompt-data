Postcondition: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list. `b` is an empty list. Since `len(b) == 0`, `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` remains unchanged. `i` is -1 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` remains unchanged. `n` is greater than 0. `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `cp` is 0. `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` remains the last element of `a`.**
