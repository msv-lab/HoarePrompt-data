The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This will change the state of `a` by adding a new element to it. The other variables remain unchanged unless their values depend on the new state of `a`.

Given the initial state, `a` could be either an empty list or not an empty list. After the operation, `a` will definitely have at least one element, specifically `lit[i]`. 

Here's the updated state of the variables:
- `a` will now include `lit[i]` as its last element.
- `b`, `s`, `i`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a` is a list that includes `lit[i]` as its last element; `b` is a list that may or may not have `lit[i]` appended based on conditions; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b)`; `n` is greater than `i`; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cp` is 0; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `len(b) == 0`, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.**
