The code appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This means the list `a` will now contain one more element, which is `lit[i]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, `s`, `i`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged unless `a` was previously empty, in which case `x` would now be set to `lit[i]` instead of `float('inf')`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers with the new element `lit[i]` appended, `b` is a list that is modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer incremented based on certain conditions, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is `lit[i]` if `a` was empty before, otherwise `x` is the last element of the list `a`, `y` is an integer or `float('inf')` based on the conditions.**
