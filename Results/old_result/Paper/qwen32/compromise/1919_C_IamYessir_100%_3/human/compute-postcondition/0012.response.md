Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is `float('inf')`.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is explicitly set to `float('inf')`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
