Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, `b` is a list (either empty or not empty), `cp` is 0, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element, `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list or the last element of `a` if `a` is not an empty list, and `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty or the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty. Additionally, `x` is greater than `y`, and `y` is less than `lit[i]`. The current value of `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.**
