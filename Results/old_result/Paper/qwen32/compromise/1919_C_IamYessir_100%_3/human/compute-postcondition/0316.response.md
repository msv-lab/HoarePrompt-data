The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` modifies the list `a` by appending the element `lit[i]` to it. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Since `a` was either empty or not empty initially, after appending an element, `a` is guaranteed to not be empty. The value of `x` was initially `float('inf')` if `a` was empty, or the last element of `a` if `a` was not empty. After the append operation, `x` becomes the last element of `a`, which is `lit[i]`. The other variables `b`, `s`, `i`, `n`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is not an empty list, `b` is a list that may or may not have `lit[i]` appended based on conditions, `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i`, `x` is `lit[i]`, `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.**
