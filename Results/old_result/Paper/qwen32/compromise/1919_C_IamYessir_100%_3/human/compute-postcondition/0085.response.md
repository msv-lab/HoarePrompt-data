The code snippet provided appends the `i`-th element of the list `lit` to the list `a`. Therefore, the list `a` will have an additional element, which is `lit[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged unless `a` was previously empty, in which case `x` would be updated to the newly added element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is set to the last element of the list `a` (previously `x` was positive infinity if `a` was empty, otherwise it was the last element of `a`), `y` is positive infinity if the list `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of the list `b`, `a` is a list with an additional element `lit[i]` appended to it.**
