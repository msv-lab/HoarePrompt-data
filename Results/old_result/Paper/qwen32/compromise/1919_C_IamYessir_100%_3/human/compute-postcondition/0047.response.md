The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must remain the same.

Given that `i` is the loop variable and `n` is the upper limit of the loop, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `i` incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1**.
