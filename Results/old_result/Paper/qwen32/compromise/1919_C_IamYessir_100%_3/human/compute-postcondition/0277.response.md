The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This will change the list `b` by adding one more element to it. No other variables are directly affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list.
- `b` is a list (either empty or not).
- `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element.
- `i` is -1 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b) - 1`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `cp` is 0.
- `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`.
- `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.
- `x` is not equal to `y`.
- `x` is less than `y`.
- `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`.
- `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.

After executing `b.append(lit[i])`:
- `b` will have one more element, specifically `lit[i]` will be added to the end of `b`.
- `y` will now be the last element of `b`, which is `lit[i]` (since `lit[i]` is appended to `b`).

Output State: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is a list with `lit[i]` appended to it; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is -1 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b) - 2`; `n` is greater than 0; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cp` is 0; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `lit[i]`; `x` is not equal to `y`; `x` is less than `y`; `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`; `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.**
