The code snippet assigns the last element of the list `b` to the variable `y`. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is set to positive infinity if the list `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is set to the last element of the list `a`, and `y` is the last element of the list `b`.**
