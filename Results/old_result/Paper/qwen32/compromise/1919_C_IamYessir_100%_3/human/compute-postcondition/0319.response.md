Postcondition: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is a list that may or may not have `lit[i]` appended; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is greater than `i`; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a` if `lit[i]` was not greater than `x`, or `lit[i]` if `lit[i]` was greater than `x`; `y` is `lit[i]`. If `y >= lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is appended to `b`. If `y < lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, `x` is updated to `lit[i]`.**
