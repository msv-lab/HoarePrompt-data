Output State: **`a` is not an empty list (lit[i] has been appended); `b` is a list that may or may not have lit[i] appended based on conditions; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is greater than `i`; `x` is the last element of `a` (which is lit[i]); `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.**

In simpler terms, `a` now contains at least one element (lit[i]). The other variables remain unchanged except for `x`, which is now the last element of `a`.
