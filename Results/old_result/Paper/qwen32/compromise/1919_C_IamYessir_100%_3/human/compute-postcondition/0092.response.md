Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `x` was originally greater than `y`, the following occurs: If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, the list `b` includes an additional element `lit[i]`. Otherwise, if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, the list `b` includes the element `lit[i]`. If `x` was originally greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` has `lit[i]` appended to it, `x` is set to `lit[i]`, and `y` remains as the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, or positive infinity if `b` is empty. Otherwise, `x` and `y` retain their original values. If `x` is not greater than `y`, `x` is set to the last element of the list `a` (previously `x` was positive infinity if `a` was empty, otherwise it was the last element of `a`), and `y` is positive infinity if the list `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of the list `b`. If `x` equals `y`, `a` now contains all its previous elements plus `lit[i]`. If `x` is not equal to `y`, for each `lit[i]` in `lit`, if `x` >= `lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is added to the end of the list `a`. If `x` < `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` > `y`, `lit[i]` is added to the end of the list `a`. If `x` < `lit[i]` and `y` >= `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` > `x`, `lit[i]` is added to the end of the list `b`.**
