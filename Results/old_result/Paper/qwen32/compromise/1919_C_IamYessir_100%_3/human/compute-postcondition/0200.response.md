Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1. If `lit[i] > x`, then `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element. If `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`, then `a` has `lit[i]` appended to it and `x` is set to `lit[i]`. The value of `y` remains the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`. If the condition `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y` is not met, `a` and `x` remain unchanged. `b` and `s` are modified based on certain conditions as per the original precondition.**
