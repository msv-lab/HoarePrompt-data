Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a, b = [], []` reassigns both `a` and `b` to be empty lists, while all other variables remain unchanged.
