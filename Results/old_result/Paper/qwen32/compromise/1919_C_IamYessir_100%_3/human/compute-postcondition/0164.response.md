Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `x` was equal to `y`, `a` now includes `lit[i]`, `x` is updated to `lit[i]`, and `y` remains the same. Otherwise, `a` includes `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i]` or `lit[i] > y`, `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element if `y >= lit[i] > x` and `lit[i]` is greater than the last element of the previous `b`, `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[i]` is greater than the last element of the previous `b` and `y >= lit[i] > x`, `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i]`, and `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `b` was empty or the last element of `b` after the append operation if `b` was not empty, with the condition that `x` is less than `y`. If `x` is not less than `y`, the state of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, `s`, `x`, and `y` remains unchanged.**
