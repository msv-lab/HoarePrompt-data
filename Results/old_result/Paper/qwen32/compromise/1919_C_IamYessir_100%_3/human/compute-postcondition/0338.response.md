Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `s` is 2 if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` (originally 1), otherwise `s` remains 1, `i` is `len(b)`, `n` is the input integer, `lit` is the list of integers obtained from the input, and `cp` is 0.**
