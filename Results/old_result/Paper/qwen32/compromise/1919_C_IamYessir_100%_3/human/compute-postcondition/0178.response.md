Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are lists that are modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer incremented based on certain conditions, `i` is incremented by 1 if `y < lit[i]` and remains the same if `y >= lit[i]`. If `y >= lit[i]`, `b` has `lit[i]` appended to it. If `y < lit[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and if `lit[i] > x`, `b` includes the element `lit[i]` appended to it. If `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`, `a` has the `i`-th element of `lit` appended, `x` is set to `lit[i]`, and `y` is updated to the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`. If the condition `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y` is not met, `a` remains unchanged, and `x` and `y` retain their original values. If `a` is empty, `x` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If `b` is empty, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is updated to the last element of `b`.**
