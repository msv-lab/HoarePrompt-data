The code snippet assigns the value `float('inf')` to the variable `y`. None of the other variables are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are lists that are modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer incremented based on certain conditions, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a` is empty, `x` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of the list `a`. `y` is `float('inf')`.**
