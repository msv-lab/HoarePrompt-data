The provided code snippet appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This operation modifies the list `b` by adding a new element to it. No other variables are explicitly changed by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` and `b` are lists that are modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer that is incremented based on certain conditions, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a` is empty, `x` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If `b` is empty, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is updated to the last element of `b`. The list `b` now includes the element `lit[i]` appended to it.**
