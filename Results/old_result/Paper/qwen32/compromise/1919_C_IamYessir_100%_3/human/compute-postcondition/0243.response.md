Postcondition: **`a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element (which is 0 since `b` is empty), `i` is `len(b) - 1` (which is -1, but will be overwritten by the loop to 0), `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0. The condition `len(a) == 0` is true.**
