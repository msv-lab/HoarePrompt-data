Postcondition: **`a` is a list, and if `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, then `a` includes the element `lit[i]` at the end. `b` is a list (either empty or not). `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element. `i` is -1 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b) - 1`. `n` is greater than 0. `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `cp` is 0. `x` is `lit[i]` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`. `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`. `y` is less than `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`. If the condition `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y` is not met, the list `a` remains unchanged.**
