The code appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This affects the list `a` by adding a new element to it. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `x`, and `y`) are not directly modified by this line of code, so their values remain as they were in the initial state.

Since `a` has a new element appended to it, if `a` was previously empty, it is no longer empty, and `x` would no longer be set to positive infinity. Instead, `x` would be set to the last element of `a`, which is `lit[i]`. If `a` was not empty, `x` would still be set to the last element of `a`, which is now `lit[i]`.

The Output State is described as follows:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `lit` is a list of integers.
- `cp` is 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `a` has a new element `lit[i]` appended to it.
- `x` is set to `lit[i]`.
- `y` remains the same (positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise the last element of `b`).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` has `lit[i]` appended to it, `x` is `lit[i]`, `y` is positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise the last element of `b`.**
