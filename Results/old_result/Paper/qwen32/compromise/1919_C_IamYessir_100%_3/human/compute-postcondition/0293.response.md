The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. 

Given the initial state:
- `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list.
- `b` is a list that may or may not have `lit[i]` appended based on conditions.
- `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element.
- `i` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b)`.
- `n` is greater than `i`.
- `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `cp` is 0.
- `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`.
- `y` is `float('inf')` if `len(b) == 0`, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.

After executing `a.append(lit[i])`, the list `a` will have one more element, which is `lit[i]`. The value of `x` will now be `lit[i]` since `x` is updated to the last element of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list with `lit[i]` appended; `b` is a list that may or may not have `lit[i]` appended based on conditions; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b)`; `n` is greater than `i`; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cp` is 0; `x` is `lit[i]`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `len(b) == 0`, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.**
