The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This affects the list `a` by adding a new element to it. 

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, `s`, `i`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged unless the state of `a` impacts them directly. Since `x` is set based on the last element of `a`, and `a` has just been modified, `x` will be updated to the newly appended value from `lit[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list with the new element `lit[i]` appended, `b` is a list that is modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer incremented based on certain conditions, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the last element of the list `a` which is `lit[i]`, and `y` is set to the last element of the list `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`.**
