Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is set to the last element of the list `a` (previously `x` was positive infinity if `a` was empty, otherwise it was the last element of `a`), and `y` is positive infinity if the list `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of the list `b`. If `x` equals `y`, `a` now contains all its previous elements plus `lit[i]`. If `x` is not equal to `y`, for each `lit[i]` in `lit`, if `x` >= `lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is added to the end of the list `a`. If `x` < `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` > `y`, `lit[i]` is added to the end of the list `a`. If `x` < `lit[i]` and `y` >= `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` > `x`, `lit[i]` is added to the end of the list `b`.**
