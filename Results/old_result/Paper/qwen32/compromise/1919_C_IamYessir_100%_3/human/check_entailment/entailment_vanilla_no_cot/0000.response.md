Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the total penalty. The program attempts to split the array into two subsequences based on some conditions, but these conditions do not guarantee that the subsequences will have the minimum penalty sum.

The key issue is that the program does not consider an optimal strategy for splitting the array. The optimal strategy involves finding the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LIS) of the array. The minimum penalty is then `n - length of LIS`, where `n` is the length of the array. The remaining elements that are not part of the LIS can be placed in the other subsequence, and the penalty for these elements would be zero.

Here's an outline of a correct approach:

1. Find the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LIS) of the array.
2. The penalty for the LIS is `length of LIS - 1` (because there are `length of LIS - 1` increasing pairs).
3. The penalty for the remaining elements is `0` because they can be placed in the other subsequence in any order.
4. The total penalty is `length of LIS - 1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program using this approach:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    import bisect

    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, input[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        
        # Find the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence
        lis = []
        for num in arr:
            pos = bisect.bisect_right(lis, num)
            if pos == len(lis):
                lis.append(num)
            else:
                lis[pos] = num
        
        # The minimum penalty is n - len(lis)
        penalty = n - len(lis)
        results.append(penalty)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected program reads the input, computes the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence for each test case, and calculates the minimum penalty accordingly.
