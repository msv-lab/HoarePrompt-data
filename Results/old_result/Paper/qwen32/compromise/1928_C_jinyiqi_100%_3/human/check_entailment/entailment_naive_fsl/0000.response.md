Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of valid `k` values for each test case. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not defined in the given code snippet, which leads to a NameError. Additionally, the logic for determining valid `k` values seems flawed and does not accurately reflect the problem description.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Undefined Function**: The function `func_1` is used but not defined in the given code. This will cause a runtime error.

2. **Logic for Determining Valid `k`**: The logic for determining the valid `k` values is not correctly implemented. The problem requires checking for each `k` whether the position `n` corresponds to the number `x` in the described sequence.

Here is a corrected version of the program that should work correctly:

```python
def count_valid_ks(n, x):
    count = 0
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        period = 2 * k - 2
        position_in_period = (n - 1) % period
        if position_in_period < k - 1:
            if position_in_period + 1 == x:
                count += 1
        else:
            if 2 * k - 2 - position_in_period == x:
                count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_ks(n, x))
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible `k` values from 2 to `n` and checks whether the position `n` corresponds to the number `x` in the described sequence. This ensures that the program correctly handles all potential cases as per the problem description.
