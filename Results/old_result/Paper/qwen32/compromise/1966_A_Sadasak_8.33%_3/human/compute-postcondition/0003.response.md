Output State: **The program returns `frequency_table`, which is a dictionary where each key is a unique number from the list `arr` and each value is the minimum of the count of that number in `arr` and `k`.**

In simpler terms, the program returns a dictionary (`frequency_table`) where each key is a unique number from the list `arr`, and the value for each key is the smaller of two things: how many times that number appears in `arr`, or the number `k`.
