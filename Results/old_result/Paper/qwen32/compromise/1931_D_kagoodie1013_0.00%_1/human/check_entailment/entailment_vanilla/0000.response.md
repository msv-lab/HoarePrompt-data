Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
We need to find the number of beautiful pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) in the array where:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it processes the array to count the beautiful pairs. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The input is read in one go and split into a list of strings.
   - The number of test cases `t` is extracted from the first element.
   - For each test case, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are read, followed by the array `arr` of length `n`.

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - For each test case, two dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are initialized to keep track of the remainders of the elements when divided by `x` and `y` respectively.
   - The program iterates over each element `num` in the array `arr`:
     - It calculates the negative modulo of `num` with `x` (`mod_x = -num % x`) and the positive modulo of `num` with `y` (`mod_y = num % y`).
     - It then adds the counts of these remainders from the dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` to the `count` of beautiful pairs.
     - It updates the dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` with the positive modulo of `num` with `x` and `y` respectively.

### Issues in the Program

The main issue in the program is the calculation of `mod_x` as `-num % x`. This is incorrect because:
- The condition for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) being beautiful requires \(a_i + a_j\) to be divisible by `x`. This translates to \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\). But the negative modulo should be handled correctly. Instead of `-num % x`, it should be `(x - num % x) % x` to ensure the remainder is in the range \([0, x-1]\).

### Correct Approach

The correct approach should be:
- Calculate `mod_x` as `(x - num % x) % x` to ensure the remainder is non-negative.
- Calculate `mod_y` as `num % y`.
- Use these values to update the count of beautiful pairs and the dictionaries.

### Conclusion

Given the incorrect calculation of `mod_x`, the program does not correctly count the beautiful pairs as per the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
