The only variable in the loop head is `num` and the iterable `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable `arr`. If `arr` has at least one element, the loop can execute. The current state does not specify what `arr` is, so we need to adjust it to ensure the loop can execute. Additionally, `num` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts since it will be assigned the first element of `arr` during the first iteration.

State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; `arr` must be a list with at least one element**
