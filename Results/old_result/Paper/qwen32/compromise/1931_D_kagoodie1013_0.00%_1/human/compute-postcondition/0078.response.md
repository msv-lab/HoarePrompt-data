The code snippet `mod_y_key = num % y` updates the value of `mod_y_key` based on the current values of `num` and `y`. Given the initial state, `num` is the second element of `arr`, and `y` is 8. 

Since `test_cases` contains tuples where the fourth element is `arr`, we need to determine the value of `num` for each test case:
- For the first test case, `arr` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, so `num` is `2`.
- For the second test case, `arr` is `[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, so `num` is `7`.

Now, let's calculate `mod_y_key` for each test case:
- For the first test case where `num` is `2` and `y` is `8`, `mod_y_key` becomes `2 % 8`, which is `2`.
- For the second test case where `num` is `7` and `y` is `8`, `mod_y_key` becomes `7 % 8`, which is `7`.

Since the problem statement does not specify which test case is being executed, we consider both possibilities. Therefore, `mod_y_key` can be either `2` or `7`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is [(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]; `results` is [6, 13]; `count` is either 0, 1, or 2; `mod_x_map` is {1: 1} or {6: 1} or {1: 2} or {6: 2}; `mod_y_map` is {1: 1} or {6: 1} or {1: 2} or {6: 2}; `n` is 6; `x` is 4; `y` is 8; `arr` is a list with at least two elements; `num` is the second element of `arr`; `mod_x` is either 2 or 1; `mod_y` is either 2 or 7; `mod_x_key` is 1; `mod_y_key` is either 2 or 7.**
