The only object in the loop head is the variable `num` from the list `arr`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `num` to reflect the start of the next iteration of the loop. Since `arr` must be a list with at least one element, we need to ensure that `num` is set to the next element in the list during the next iteration.

Given that `arr` is a list with at least one element, and assuming the loop has just completed an iteration where `num` was the first element of `arr`, the next iteration should set `num` to the second element of `arr`.

Since we do not have the specific elements of `arr` beyond the first one, we can only describe the state in terms of the next element in the list.

State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is `{2: 1}`; `mod_y_map` is `{2: 1}`; `arr` must be a list with at least two elements; `mod_x` is 2; `mod_y` is 3; `mod_y_key` is 2; `num` is the second element of `arr`**
