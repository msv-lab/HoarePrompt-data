The code snippet `mod_y_key = num % y` calculates the modulus of `num` with `y` and assigns the result to `mod_y_key`. Given the initial state, `num` is `10` and `y` is `8`. Therefore, `mod_y_key` becomes `10 % 8`, which is `2`.

Here is the updated output state with only the affected variable changed:

Output State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]`; `results` is `[6]`; `count` is `1`; `mod_x_map` is `{2: 1}`; `mod_y_map` is `{5: 1}`; `n` is `6`; `x` is `4`; `y` is `8`; `arr` is `[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`; `mod_x` is `2`; `mod_y` is `2`; `mod_x_key` is `2`; `mod_y_key` is `2`; `num` is `10`.**
