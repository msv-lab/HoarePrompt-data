The code snippet `mod_x_key = num % x` updates the value of `mod_x_key` based on the current values of `num` and `x`. Given the initial state, `num` is 3 and `x` is 2. Therefore, `mod_x_key` is updated to `3 % 2`, which equals 1.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 4; `mod_x_map` is `{2: 2}`; `mod_y_map` is `{2: 1, 0: 1}`; `arr` must be a list with at least two elements; `mod_x` is 2; `mod_y` is `3 % y`; `mod_y_key` is 0; `num` is 3; `mod_x_key` is 1**.
