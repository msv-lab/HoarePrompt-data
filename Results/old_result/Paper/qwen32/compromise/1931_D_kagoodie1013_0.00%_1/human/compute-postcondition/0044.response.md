The value of `mod_x` is recalculated as `-num % x`. Given `num` is `10` and `x` is `4`, the expression `-10 % 4` evaluates to `-2 % 4` which is `2`. Therefore, `mod_x` is updated to `2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]`; `results` is `[6]`; `count` is `0`; `mod_x_map` is `{2: 1}`; `mod_y_map` is `{5: 1}`; `n` is `6`; `x` is `4`; `y` is `8`; `arr` is `[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`; `mod_x` is `2`; `mod_y` is `6`; `mod_x_key` is `2`; `mod_y_key` is `5`; `num` is `10`**.
