The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, which is being iterated over from the list `arr`. Therefore, we need to adjust `num` to the next element in `arr` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]`
- `results` is an empty list
- `count` is 1
- `mod_x_map` is `{2: 2}`
- `mod_y_map` is `{2: 1, 0: 1}`
- `arr` must be a list with at least two elements
- `mod_x` is 0
- `mod_y` is 2
- `mod_y_key` is 0
- `num` is the second element of `arr` (which is `2`)
- `mod_x_key` is 2

Since `num` is currently the second element of `arr` (which is `2`), for the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be updated to the third element of `arr` (which is `3`).

State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 1; `mod_x_map` is `{2: 2}`; `mod_y_map` is `{2: 1, 0: 1}`; `arr` must be a list with at least two elements; `mod_x` is 0; `mod_y` is 2; `mod_y_key` is 0; `num` is the third element of `arr`; `mod_x_key` is 2**
