To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `low + 1 < high`.

Given the state:
- `n` is the return value of `func_1()`
- `k` is the return value of `func_1()`
- `arr` is the return value of `func_2()`
- `pos` is the index of the first element in `arr` that matches `k`, or `-1` if no match is found
- `low` is `0`
- `high` is `n`
- `st` is an empty set

We need to ensure that `low + 1 < high` is true for the loop to execute.

### Analysis:
- `low` is initialized to `0`.
- `high` is initialized to `n`, which is the return value of `func_1()`.

For the loop condition `low + 1 < high` to be true:
- `0 + 1 < n` must be true, which simplifies to `1 < n`.

### Conclusion:
The only variable we can adjust within the loop head is `n` (since `low` is fixed at `0`). Therefore, `n` must be greater than `1` for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` remains the return value of `func_1()`, `arr` remains the return value of `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first element in `arr` that matches `k`, or `-1` if no match is found, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is an empty set**
