In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range it iterates over is defined by `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variables `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and `st` are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted in order for the loop to execute.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the return value of `func_1()`, `arr` is the return value of `func_2()`, `pos` is -1, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search boundaries in the binary search algorithm, and `st` is a set used to keep track of the midpoints visited during the binary search.**
