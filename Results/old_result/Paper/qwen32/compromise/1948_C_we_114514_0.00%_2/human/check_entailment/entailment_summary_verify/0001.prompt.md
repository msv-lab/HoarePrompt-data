You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:

    t = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input().strip()
        row2 = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, (row1, row2)))

                    reachable_first_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
        if reachable_second_row:

            results.append('NO')
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` containing only '<' and '>' characters. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to reach the end of the second string starting from the beginning of the first string, moving only to the right ('>') or switching to the corresponding position in the other string if the current character is '<'. The function returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether the end of the second string is reachable.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program against the problem description step by step to determine its correctness.

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.
   - It stores these values in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes two boolean variables:
     - `reachable_first_row` is set to `True` (since the robot starts at (1, 1)).
     - `reachable_second_row` is set to `False`.
   - The program then iterates through each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Logic for Reaching the Second Row:**
   - If the robot is in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in `row1[j]` points right (`'>'`):
       - If `j` is the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` because the robot can move to (2, n).
       - Otherwise, it does nothing, indicating the robot stays in the first row and moves right.
     - If the arrow in `row1[j]` points left (`'<'`):
       - It sets `reachable_first_row` to `False` because the robot can't stay in the first row.
       - If `j` is not the last column and the arrow in `row2[j]` points right (`'>'`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` because the robot can move to the second row and then right.
   - If the robot is in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in `row2[j]` points right (`'>'`):
       - If `j` is the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (redundant, but does no harm).
       - Otherwise, it does nothing, indicating the robot stays in the second row and moves right.
     - If the arrow in `row2[j]` points left (`'<'`), it does nothing because the robot stays in the second row and moves left.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all columns for a test case, the program checks if `reachable_second_row` is `True`.
   - If `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it appends 'YES' to `results`.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'NO' to `results`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The program prints the results for all test cases.

**Correctness Analysis:**
- The program correctly handles the movement of the robot according to the rules.
- It correctly sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` if the robot can reach the last column of the second row.
- The logic for handling the arrows and transitions between rows is accurate based on the problem description.

**Conclusion:**
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
