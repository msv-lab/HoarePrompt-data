### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if a robot can reach the cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1) in a 2-row grid. The robot's movement is constrained by the arrows in each cell, which can point either left ('<') or right ('>'). The robot must follow the arrows after each move and cannot move outside the grid.

Let's break down the program's logic to see if it correctly implements the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of columns `n` and the two rows of the grid, `row1` and `row2`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - `reachable_first_row` is initialized to `True`, indicating that the robot starts in the first row.
   - `reachable_second_row` is initialized to `False`, indicating that the robot has not yet reached the second row.
   - The program iterates over each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Movement Logic:**
   - If the robot is in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the current cell of `row1` points right ('>'):
       - If the robot is at the last column (`j == n-1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` because the robot can move to the second row at the last column.
     - If the arrow in the current cell of `row1` points left ('<'):
       - The robot cannot stay in the first row, so `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`.
       - If the robot is not at the last column (`j < n-1`) and the arrow in the corresponding cell of `row2` points right ('>'), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` because the robot can move to the second row and continue moving right.
   - If the robot is in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the current cell of `row2` points right ('>'):
       - If the robot is at the last column (`j == n-1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` because the robot has reached the target cell (2, n).

4. **Result:**
   - After processing all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, the robot can reach the target cell, and the program appends 'YES' to the results list.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

The logic appears to correctly simulate the robot's movement and determine if it can reach the target cell (2, n). The program handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement.
