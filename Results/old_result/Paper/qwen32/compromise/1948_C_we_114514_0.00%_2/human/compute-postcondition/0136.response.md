Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is `False`, and `results` contains `'NO'`. If `reachable_second_row` is `True`, then if `row2[j]` equals `'>'` and `j` is equal to `n - 1`, the current value of `j` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged. If `reachable_second_row` is `False`, the state remains unchanged, `j` is 0.**

In simpler terms, the value of `reachable_first_row` has been changed to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
