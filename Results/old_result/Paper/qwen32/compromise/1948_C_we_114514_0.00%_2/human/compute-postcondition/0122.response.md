Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is `False`, `reachable_second_row` is `True`, and `results` contains `'NO'`. The character at index `j` in `row1` is not `'>'`. Additionally, `j` is less than `n - 1` and the character at index `j` in `row2` is `'>'`.**

In simpler terms, `reachable_second_row` has been set to `True`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
