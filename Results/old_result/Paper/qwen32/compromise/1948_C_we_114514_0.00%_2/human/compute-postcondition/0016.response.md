Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters. If `row1[j]` is '>', then `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is True if `j` equals `n - 1`, otherwise `reachable_second_row` remains False, and `j` is equal to `n - 1` if the if condition is met, otherwise `j` remains unchanged. If `row1[j]` is not '>', then `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True if `j < n - 1` and `row2[j]` is equal to '>', otherwise `reachable_second_row` remains False, and `j` is 0.**
