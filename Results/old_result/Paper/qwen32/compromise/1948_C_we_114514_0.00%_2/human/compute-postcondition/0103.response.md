To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the logic of the loop and how the variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` change based on the conditions specified.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `reachable_first_row` is set to `True`.
   - `reachable_second_row` is set to `False`.

2. **Loop Iteration:**
   - For each `j` in the range `n`:
     - If `reachable_first_row` is `True`:
       - If `row1[j] == '>'`:
         - If `j == n - 1`, set `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
       - If `row1[j] != '>'`:
         - Set `reachable_first_row` to `False`.
         - If `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`, set `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
     - If `reachable_second_row` is `True`:
       - If `row2[j] == '>'` and `j == n - 1`, set `reachable_second_row` to `True`.

### Key Points:
- The loop iterates `n` times.
- `reachable_first_row` is initially `True` and can only be set to `False` if an element in `row1` is not `'>'`.
- `reachable_second_row` can be set to `True` if:
  - `reachable_first_row` is `True` and the last element of `row1` is `'>'`.
  - `reachable_first_row` is `False` and an element in `row2` is `'>'` before the last element.
  - `reachable_second_row` is already `True` and the last element of `row2` is `'>'`.

### Final Output State:
- After all iterations, `reachable_first_row` will be `True` only if every element in `row1` is `'>'`.
- `reachable_second_row` will be `True` if:
  - The last element of `row1` is `'>'` and all previous elements in `row1` are `'>'`.
  - There is a `'>'` in `row2` before the last element and `reachable_first_row` becomes `False`.
  - The last element of `row2` is `'>'` and `reachable_second_row` was already `True`.

### Conclusion:
The final state of `reachable_second_row` will determine the final result for the test case, which will be added to the `results` list as either `'YES'` or `'NO'`.

Output State: **`reachable_first_row` is `True` if all elements in `row1` are `'>'`; otherwise, it is `False`. `reachable_second_row` is `True` if any of the conditions mentioned above are met; otherwise, it is `False`.**

In natural language: After all iterations, `reachable_first_row` will be `True` only if every character in `row1` is `'>'`. `reachable_second_row` will be `True` if the last character in `row1` is `'>'` and all previous characters are `'>'`, or if there is a `'>'` in `row2` before the last character, or if the last character in `row2` is `'>'` and `reachable_second_row` was already `True`.
