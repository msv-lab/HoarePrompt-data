Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` can be either `True` or `False`, and `results` contains `'NO'`. If `reachable_first_row` is `True` and `row1[j]` equals `'>'`, then `j` is 0 unless `reachable_second_row` is `True` and `j` was originally `n - 1`, in which case `j` remains `n - 1`. If `reachable_first_row` is `False`, then `j` is 0 unless `reachable_second_row` is `True` and `row2[j]` equals `'>'` and `j` is less than `n - 1`, in which case `j` is incremented by 1. If `reachable_second_row` is `False`, `j` remains 0.**
