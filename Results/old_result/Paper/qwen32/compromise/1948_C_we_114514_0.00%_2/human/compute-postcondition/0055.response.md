The only variable in the loop head is `test_case`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If there are more test cases in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_case` was the last test case processed, which means we need to move to the next test case in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `reachable_second_row` is True, or the string `'NO'` if `reachable_second_row` is False, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, and `reachable_first_row` is True or False based on the characters in `row1`. The next `test_case` will be the next element in the `test_cases` list.**

Since `test_case` is the loop variable, the next iteration will automatically take the next element from `test_cases`. We don't need to specify the values of `n`, `row1`, `row2`, `reachable_first_row`, or `reachable_second_row` again unless they are part of the `test_case` itself.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `reachable_second_row` is True, or the string `'NO'` if `reachable_second_row` is False. The next `test_case` will be the next element in the `test_cases` list.**
