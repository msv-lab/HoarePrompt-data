The code attempts to append the string `'NO'` to the variable `results`. However, `results` is initially a string, not a list, so this operation would result in an AttributeError in Python. Assuming the intention was for `results` to be a list, we can proceed with that assumption.

Given that `results` is initially the string `'NO'`, if we were to treat it as a list and append `'NO'` to it, `results` would become `['NO', 'NO']`.

Output State: **`reachable_first_row` is `False` or `True` based on `row1` and `row2`, `reachable_second_row` is `False`, `results` is `['NO', 'NO']`**
