The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `j + 1`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Given that `j` was `j + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the value of `j` at the start of the next iteration should be `j + 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, or the string `'NO'` if `reachable_second_row` is `False`, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is `True`, `j` is `j + 2`. If `reachable_second_row` is `True` and `row2[j] == '>'` and `j` equals `n - 1`, then `reachable_second_row` is `True`. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` retains its original value. If `reachable_second_row` is `False`, it retains its original value.**
