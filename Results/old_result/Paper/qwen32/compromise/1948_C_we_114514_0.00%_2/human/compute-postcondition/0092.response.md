The given Python code snippet sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. This change affects the variable `reachable_second_row` directly. No other variables are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, or the string `'NO'` if `reachable_second_row` is `False`, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is `True`, `j` is `j + 2`, `reachable_second_row` is `True`.**
