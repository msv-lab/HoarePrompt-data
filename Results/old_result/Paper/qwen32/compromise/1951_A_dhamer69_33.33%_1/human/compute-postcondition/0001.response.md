To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition `t > 0`. The variables `start` and `end` are not part of the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted.

The loop condition is dependent solely on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given that `t` is an input integer, we can adjust its state to ensure the condition is met.

State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than 0**
