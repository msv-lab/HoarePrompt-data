### Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect based on the provided problem description and execution summary. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of the Product**:
   - The problem requires calculating the product of all elements of the array `a` at each step and then taking the remainder when divided by `m`. 
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly constructs a list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the commands in `s` and then calculates the product of the elements in the reversed `b`. This does not match the requirement of calculating the product of the current state of `a` at each step.

2. **Ignoring `m`**:
   - The variable `m` is provided as input and should be used to take the remainder of the product at each step. However, `m` is not used in the function `func_1`.

3. **Incorrect Order of Operations**:
   - The function calculates the product of the elements in the reversed `b` list and then reverses the result to get the final answer. This is not the correct order of operations as per the problem statement. The product should be calculated in the order of the commands, and the remainder should be taken at each step before the array is modified.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It does not calculate the product of the current state of `a` at each step, take the remainder when divided by `m`, and then modify the array based on the commands. Instead, it constructs a new list `b` based on the commands and calculates the product of `b` in reverse order, which is not the intended behavior.
