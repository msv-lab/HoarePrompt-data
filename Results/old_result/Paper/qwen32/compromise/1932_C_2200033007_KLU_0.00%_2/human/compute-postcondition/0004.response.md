To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop iterates through each character in the string `s` of length `n`. Depending on whether the character is 'L' or 'R', it appends either the leftmost or rightmost element of the list `a` to the list `b`, and then adjusts the pointers `l` and `r` accordingly.

- If `s[i]` is 'L', the leftmost element `a[l]` is appended to `b`, and `l` is incremented by 1.
- If `s[i]` is 'R', the rightmost element `a[r]` is appended to `b`, and `r` is decremented by 1.

After `n` iterations, `b` will contain `n` elements, and `l` and `r` will have moved through the list `a` according to the instructions in `s`.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the output state will be:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is the number of test cases.
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are the dimensions of the current test case.
- `a` remains unchanged as the elements are not modified, only selected.
- `s` remains unchanged as it dictates the selection process.
- `b` will be a new list of length `n` with elements selected from `a` based on `s`.
- `l` will be equal to `r + 1` because `l` increments and `r` decrements, and they will eventually meet or cross each other after `n` iterations.
- `r` will be equal to `l - 1` for the same reason as above.

Thus, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for each i; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list of `n` integers selected from `a` based on `s`; `l` is `n`; `r` is `n - 1`.** 

However, to be more precise about the final values of `l` and `r` after the loop, they should be:
- `l` is `n` if `n` is even, or `n//2 + 1` if `n` is odd.
- `r` is `-1` if `n` is even, or `n//2 - 1` if `n` is odd.

But since the problem asks for a general description and not specific values of `l` and `r` after the loop, we can describe it as:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for each i; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list of `n` integers selected from `a` based on `s`; `l` is equal to `r + 1`; `r` is equal to `l - 1`.**
