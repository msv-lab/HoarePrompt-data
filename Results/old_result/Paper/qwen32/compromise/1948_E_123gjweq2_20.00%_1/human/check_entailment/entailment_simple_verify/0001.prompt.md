You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic and output against the problem requirements. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Graph Construction**: We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to vertices numbered from 1 to n. An edge is added between vertices i and j if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| ≤ k.
2. **Clique Partitioning**: The graph must be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques, where each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
    - Computes the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
    - Initializes two arrays: `arr` for vertex labels and `cliquess` for clique assignments.
    - Iterates over each clique and calls `make_array` to populate `arr` and `cliquess` for that clique.

2. **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
    - Assigns values from `left + 1` to `right + 1` to vertices in the range `[left, right]`.
    - Assigns the same clique number to all vertices in the range `[left, right]`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Global Arrays**: The `arr` and `cliquess` arrays are used globally in `make_array`, but they are not declared as global in the function. This will lead to a `NameError` because Python treats variables defined in the outer scope as read-only unless explicitly declared as global.
   
2. **Vertex Labeling**: The function `make_array` assigns labels in a sequential manner within each clique, which might not guarantee that the edge condition |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| ≤ k is satisfied for all pairs of vertices within the same clique. For example, if `k` is small, the labels might be too far apart, violating the edge condition.

3. **Clique Count**: The formula `ceil(n / k)` for the number of cliques may not always yield the minimum number of cliques required. The optimal partitioning strategy is not clearly defined in the program.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints the results for each test case, but the format is not validated against the problem requirements.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the provided program with the first test case: `n = 2`, `k = 3`.
- The program calculates `cliques = ceil(2 / 3) = 1`.
- It assigns `arr = [1, 2]` and `cliquess = [1, 1]`.
- The edge condition |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| ≤ 3 is satisfied for the pair (1, 2), so the output is correct for this case.

However, the program may not work correctly for all test cases due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with global variable usage, the vertex labeling strategy, and the clique count formula, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all valid inputs.
