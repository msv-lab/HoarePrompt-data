Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program contains several issues that prevent it from meeting the problem description correctly. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Global Variables**: The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess` without defining them within the functions. This can lead to undefined behavior if the variables are not properly initialized in the global scope before calling these functions.

2. **Logic Errors in `make_array`**:
   - The logic for filling the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays in `make_array` is flawed. The calculation of `mid` and `not_mid` does not ensure that the values assigned to `arr` are distinct integers from 1 to n.
   - The way elements are assigned to `arr` and `cliquess` does not guarantee that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| ≤ k` is satisfied for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.

3. **Incomplete Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to print the values assigned to the vertices, the number of cliques, and the partition of the graph into cliques. However, it does not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques.
   - The function `make_array` does not handle all edge cases correctly, especially when `k` is small relative to `n`.

4. **Example of Incorrect Output**:
   - Consider the test case `n = 5` and `k = 4`. The program might output something like:
     ```
     1 2 3 4 5
     1
     1 1 1 1 1
     ```
     This output is incorrect because the graph with `n = 5` and `k = 4` can be partitioned into fewer than 1 clique. For example, a valid output could be:
     ```
     1 3 5 2 4
     2
     1 1 1 2 2
     ```
     Here, the vertices are partitioned into two cliques, and the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| ≤ k` is satisfied for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.

5. **Lack of Input Handling**:
   - The provided code does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It only defines functions but does not read input or process multiple test cases.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality and fails to meet the problem description for various potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
