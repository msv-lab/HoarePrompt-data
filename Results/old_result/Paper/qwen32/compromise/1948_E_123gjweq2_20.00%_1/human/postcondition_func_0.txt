The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is between 2 and 40 inclusive, and `k` is between 1 and 2n inclusive. It divides a list of size `n` into segments of size `k` (or smaller for the last segment), fills each segment with a unique value starting from 1 up to the number of segments (`cliques`), and prints the modified list, the number of unique values used, and another list that mirrors the first list's segmentation.
