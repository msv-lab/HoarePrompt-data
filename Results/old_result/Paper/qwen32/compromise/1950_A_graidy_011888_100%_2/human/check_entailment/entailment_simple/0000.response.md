### Reasoning:
The given program is designed to read multiple test cases, each consisting of three digits \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). For each test case, the program checks:
1. If \(a < b < c\), it prints "STAIR".
2. If \(a < b\) and \(b > c\), it prints "PEAK".
3. Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

Let's break down the logic:
- The condition `a < b < c` directly checks if the digits form a stair.
- The condition `a < b and b > c` checks if the digits form a peak.
- If neither of these conditions is met, the digits do not form a stair or a peak, so the program correctly prints "NONE".

The program is structured to handle multiple test cases by iterating `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided as the first input. For each iteration, it reads the three digits and applies the logic described above.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **Input:** `1 2 3`
   - \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\), \(c = 3\)
   - Condition: `a < b < c` is true, so it prints "STAIR".

2. **Input:** `3 2 1`
   - \(a = 3\), \(b = 2\), \(c = 1\)
   - Neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b and b > c` is true, so it prints "NONE".

3. **Input:** `1 5 3`
   - \(a = 1\), \(b = 5\), \(c = 3\)
   - Condition: `a < b and b > c` is true, so it prints "PEAK".

4. **Input:** `3 4 1`
   - \(a = 3\), \(b = 4\), \(c = 1\)
   - Condition: `a < b and b > c` is true, so it prints "PEAK".

5. **Input:** `0 0 0`
   - \(a = 0\), \(b = 0\), \(c = 0\)
   - Neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b and b > c` is true, so it prints "NONE".

6. **Input:** `4 1 7`
   - \(a = 4\), \(b = 1\), \(c = 7\)
   - Neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b and b > c` is true, so it prints "NONE".

7. **Input:** `4 5 7`
   - \(a = 4\), \(b = 5\), \(c = 7\)
   - Condition: `a < b < c` is true, so it prints "STAIR".

The program correctly handles all the test cases as per the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The logic and implementation of the program are correct based on the problem description and the example provided.

Correctness: **True**
