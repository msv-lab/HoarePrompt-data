The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` based on the integer input provided. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `n` is an input integer.**
