The code snippet `a = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `a`. This variable `a` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we can assume it is being introduced here. The initial state mentions `t`, `x`, and `y` but does not specify their values or roles in this specific code snippet. Since `a` is the only variable being modified, we update the state to include `a` as the input integer.

Output State: **The function receives an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99) representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively. `a` is an input integer.**
