You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Example

Input

    6
    
    3
    
    3 2 7
    
    2
    
    3 3
    
    5
    
    5 5 5 5 5
    
    6
    
    7 9 3 17 9 13
    
    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

- Annotated Code: 
from math import gcd

cases = int(input())
for n in range(cases):
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers greater than or equal to 1.
def func_1(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the least common multiple (LCM) of integers 'a' and 'b'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are greater than or equal to 1, and returns their least common multiple (LCM).

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer representing the number of outcomes such that 1 <= N <= 50, vals is a list of integers where each integer k_i represents the multiplier for the i-th outcome such that 2 <= k_i <= 20, and the length of vals is equal to N.
def func_2():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    den = vals[0]
    for x in vals:
        den = func_1(den, x)
        
    #State: N is the integer value provided by the user input, vals is a list of integers where each integer k_i represents the multiplier for the i-th outcome such that 2 <= k_i <= 20, and the length of vals is equal to N, with vals now holding the specific integers read from the input; den is the product of all elements in vals.
    vprod = [(den // r) for r in vals]
    den = den - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `N` is the integer value provided by the user input, `vals` is a list of integers where each integer \( k_i \) represents the multiplier for the i-th outcome such that \( 2 \leq k_i \leq 20 \), and the length of `vals` is equal to `N`, with `vals` now holding the specific integers read from the input; `den` is the product of all elements in `vals` minus the sum of `vprod`; `vprod` is a list where each element is `den // r` for each `r` in `vals`; `den` is greater than 0.
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: vprod (where vprod is a list of integers calculated as den // r for each r in vals)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `N` and a list `vals` of integers from the user, calculates a product of all elements in `vals`, then computes a list `vprod` where each element is the product divided by each respective element in `vals`. It then subtracts the sum of `vprod` from the product. If the result is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string. The function returns `None`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Let's analyze why:

The program uses the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers to distribute the bets. It then calculates the bets based on the LCM divided by each multiplier and adjusts the total to ensure it's positive. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total bet is strictly less than the return for each winning outcome.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3
2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
Since all multipliers are 2, any valid distribution of bets such that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome is acceptable. For example:
```
1 1 1
```
This is valid because the total bet is 3, and the return for each winning outcome is 4.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program will calculate the LCM of 2, 2, and 2 which is 2. Then it will calculate the bets as 1, 1, 1, and the total bet will be 3. The remaining value `den` will be 2 - (1 + 1 + 1) = -2, which is not greater than 0. Therefore, the program will output `-1`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not handle all cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
