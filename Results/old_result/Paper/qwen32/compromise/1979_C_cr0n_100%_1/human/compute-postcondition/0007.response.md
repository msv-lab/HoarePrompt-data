Postcondition: **`N` is the integer value provided by the user input, `vals` is a list of integers where each integer k_i represents the multiplier for the i-th outcome such that 2 <= k_i <= 20, and the length of `vals` is equal to `N`, with `vals` now holding the specific integers read from the input. `den` is the product of all elements in `vals` minus the sum of `vprod`, and `den` is less than or equal to 0. `vprod` is a list where each element is `den // r` for each `r` in `vals`.**
