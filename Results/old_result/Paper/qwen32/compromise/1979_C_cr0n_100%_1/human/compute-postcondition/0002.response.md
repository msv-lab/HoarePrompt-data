Output State: **`N` is the integer value provided by the user input, `vals` is a list of integers where each integer k_i represents the multiplier for the i-th outcome such that 2 <= k_i <= 20, and the length of vals is equal to N, with `vals` now holding the specific integers read from the input; `den` is assigned the value of `vals[0]`.**

In simpler terms, `N` and `vals` remain unchanged, and `den` is now set to the first element of the `vals` list.
