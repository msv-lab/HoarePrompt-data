### Reasoning:
To determine the winner of the game, we need to analyze the game mechanics and the players' optimal strategies.

1. **Game Mechanics:**
   - Alice and Bob take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or not.
   - They must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Optimal Play:**
   - If the number of coins in both wallets is the same, the player who is about to move is forced into a losing position if the opponent plays optimally. This is because any move by the player will make the number of coins unequal, and the opponent can always mirror the move to keep the counts equal until the player is forced to take the last coin from a wallet with one coin.
   - If the number of coins in the wallets is different, the player can always make a move that leaves the opponent in a losing position by ensuring the difference in coins remains odd after their turn. This is because the opponent will then be forced to make a move that leaves the difference even, and the cycle continues until the opponent is forced to take the last coin from a wallet with one coin.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - If the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, Bob wins because Alice will always be forced into a losing position.
   - If the absolute difference is odd, Alice wins because she can always force Bob into a losing position.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd and then printing "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly.
