Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and contains at least two elements, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and equals 0, `v` is an even number or 0, `op` is `1 ^ (a[1] >> i & 1)`. If `op` is 0, then `t` is a list containing the updated `ai` (which is now `ai ^ val`) and `ai`, and `ai` is 0. Otherwise, `t` remains either an empty list or a list containing the updated `ai` (which is now `ai ^ val`).**
