You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function calculates and returns the maximum value between the number of times a specific bitwise operation results in zero during its execution and the length of a transformed list `a`. It processes an array `a` of non-negative integers and a non-negative integer `x` to determine this maximum value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the maximum number of segments \( k \) such that:
- The segments cover the entire array from index 1 to \( n \).
- Each segment's XOR result, when OR-ed together, does not exceed \( x \).

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program uses bitwise operations to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the key parts:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1()` reads a line of integers.
   - `func_2()` reads a single integer.
   - `func_3()` reads two integers (likely \( n \) and \( x \)).
   - `func_4()` reads a line of text.

2. **Main Logic (`func_5`):**
   - For each bit position from 29 down to 0 (since \( 0 \le a_i < 2^{30} \)), it checks the contribution of that bit to the solution.
   - It calculates whether the bit is set in \( x \) (`u`) and how many times it appears in the array (`v`).
   - If neither \( u \) nor \( v \) is set, it skips to the next bit.
   - If \( u \) is not set but \( v \) is odd, it returns `-1` because it's impossible to split the array into valid segments.
   - If \( u \) is not set and \( v \) is even, it tries to partition the array based on this bit.
   - If \( u \) is set and \( v \) is odd, it skips to the next bit.
   - If \( u \) is set and \( v \) is even, it counts how many segments can be formed with this bit being zero.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum number of segments found.

### Issues in the Program:
The logic seems overly complex and doesn't directly address the problem requirements. Specifically:
- The approach of checking each bit individually and trying to partition the array based on that bit is not straightforward or guaranteed to work correctly.
- The program does not clearly ensure that the segments cover the entire array from 1 to \( n \) without gaps.
- The handling of the OR condition between segments is not explicitly checked; it relies on the bit-level analysis which might not be sufficient.

### Correctness Evaluation:
Given the complexity and the indirect approach used in the program, it is not clear that it will always produce the correct result for all possible inputs. The problem requires a more direct approach to ensure that segments are formed correctly and that their XOR results satisfy the OR condition with \( x \).

Therefore, the provided program does not seem to correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
