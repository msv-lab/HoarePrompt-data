The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's denote it as `i_end`), and `k` is greater than 0. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i_end + 1` must be less than `k`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1, the new state of `i` will be `i + 1`. The value of `k` remains the same as it is the loop's boundary condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers as read from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `s + c * c * i * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input during the loop, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`**
