Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers as read from the input; `M` is 1000000007.**

In this output state, the variable `M` has been assigned the value `10 ** 9 + 7`, which is `1000000007`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
