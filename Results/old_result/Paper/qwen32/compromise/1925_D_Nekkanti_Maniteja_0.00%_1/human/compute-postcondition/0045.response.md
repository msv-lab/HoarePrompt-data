The code snippet updates the value of `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to it. The values of `c`, `i`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged. 

Given that `i` is `m + 2`, the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a` can be simplified to `c * (m + 2) * c * m + c * a`. 

The other variables such as `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `M` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers as read from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, `i` is `m + 2`, `k` must be greater than `m + 2`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input, `s` is updated to `s + c * (m + 2) * c * m + c * a`.**
