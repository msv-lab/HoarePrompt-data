The code snippet provided initializes a variable `s` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`) are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers as read from the input; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`; `s` is 0.**
