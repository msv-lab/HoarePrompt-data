Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Here are some key issues with the program:

1. **Combinatorial Counting**: The program incorrectly calculates the probability of choosing a specific pair of friends. The probability of picking any specific pair out of all possible pairs is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, not `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 1)`.

2. **Incrementing Friendship Values**: The program does not correctly account for the increment of friendship values over subsequent excursions. The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time it is chosen, and this needs to be considered in the expected value calculation.

3. **Expected Value Calculation**: The program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values. It incorrectly sums the contributions of each pair over k excursions without properly accounting for the increasing friendship values.

4. **Modular Inverse**: The program attempts to compute the modular inverse of the number of pairs, but it does not correctly use this inverse in the expected value calculation.

Here's a sketch of a correct approach:

1. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability of choosing any specific pair of friends is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
2. **Expected Contribution**: For each pair of friends with initial friendship value `f`, the expected contribution to the sum over `k` excursions is `f + (f + 1) + ... + (f + k - 1)`, which is `k * f + (0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (k - 1)) = k * f + k * (k - 1) // 2`.
3. **Sum Over All Pairs**: Sum the expected contributions of all pairs of friends.
4. **Modular Arithmetic**: Use modular arithmetic to compute the final result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

The provided program does not follow these steps, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
