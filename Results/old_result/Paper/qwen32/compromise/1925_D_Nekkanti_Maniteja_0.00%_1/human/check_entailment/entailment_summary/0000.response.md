### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the problem requirements step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding:
- We have `n` children and `m` pairs of friends, each with an initial friendship value `f_i`.
- The teacher randomly selects a pair of children `k` times.
- If the selected pair are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for subsequent selections.
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen, expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and return \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(M\). This seems intended to represent the probability of selecting any specific pair of children.
   - `s` is initialized to 0, which will hold the sum of expected friendship values.
   - `a` is initialized to 0, which will accumulate the sum of initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.

2. **Reading Friendships**:
   - For each of the `m` pairs, the friendship value `f` is read and added to `a`.

3. **Calculating Expected Sum**:
   - The loop runs `k` times, and for each iteration, `s` is updated using the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
   - This formula seems to be an attempt to calculate the expected sum of friendship values over `k` selections, but it is incorrect.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect. It does not correctly account for the increment in friendship values over multiple selections.
- The expected value calculation should consider the increasing friendship values for each selection, which is not properly handled in the current implementation.
- The program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values considering the dynamic changes in friendship values over `k` selections.

#### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values by considering the probability of selecting each pair and the effect of increasing friendship values over multiple selections.
- This typically involves more complex combinatorial and probabilistic calculations, which are not implemented in the current program.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
