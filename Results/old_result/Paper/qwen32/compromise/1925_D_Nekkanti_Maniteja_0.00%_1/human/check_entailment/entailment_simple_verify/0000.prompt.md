You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's analyze the issues in the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The code calculates `c` as the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `10^9 + 7`. This is correct for the probability of selecting any particular pair.
   - However, the way the sum `s` is calculated is incorrect. The sum `s` should account for the expected sum of the friendship values of all pairs chosen over `k` excursions.

2. **Incorrect Update of Sum `s`**:
   - The loop `for i in range(k)` incorrectly updates `s` with `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. This formula does not correctly reflect the expected sum of friendship values.
   - The expected value calculation should consider the probability of selecting each pair and the incremental increase in friendship values due to previous selections.

3. **Handling of Friendship Values**:
   - The code sums up all initial friendship values in `a` but does not account for the incremental increase in friendship values correctly.
   - The expected sum should be calculated by considering the probability of selecting each pair and the cumulative increase in friendship values over `k` excursions.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - While the code uses modular arithmetic correctly for the inverse, the overall sum `s` should be calculated correctly first before taking the modulo.

Here is a corrected version of the program that correctly calculates the expected value:

```python
def func():
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        prob = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)  # Probability of selecting any pair
        initial_sum = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            initial_sum = (initial_sum + f) % M
        
        # Expected sum of friendship values over k excursions
        expected_sum = (initial_sum * k) % M
        expected_sum = (expected_sum + (k * (k - 1) // 2) * prob * m) % M
        
        print(expected_sum)

func()
```

This corrected version calculates the expected sum of friendship values by considering the initial sum of friendship values and the expected increase in friendship values over `k` excursions. It correctly handles the probability of selecting each pair and the incremental increase in friendship values.
