n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 3 <= n <= m <= min((n*(n - 1))/2, 2 * 10^5). The graph is defined by a list of edges, where each edge is a tuple (u, v, w) with 1 <= u, v <= n, u != v, and 1 <= w <= 10^6. There is at most one edge between each pair of vertices, and the graph does not contain loops. The number of edges m satisfies the condition 3 <= m <= min((n*(n - 1))/2, 2 * 10^5). The sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
