The function `func_6` constructs an undirected graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges, identifies the smallest edge weight in any connected component of the graph, and performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from one of the nodes of the smallest edge. It then prints the smallest edge weight and the number of nodes visited during the DFS, followed by the list of nodes visited.
