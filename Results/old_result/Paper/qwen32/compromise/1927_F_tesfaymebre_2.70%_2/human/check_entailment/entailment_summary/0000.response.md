Reasoning: 

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding a simple cycle in an undirected weighted graph where the weight of the lightest edge is minimal. The program uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure to identify cycles and keep track of the minimum edge weight in each connected component. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: 
   - `func_1` reads an integer from the input, which is the number of test cases.
   - `func_3` reads three integers from the input, representing an edge in the graph (two vertices and the weight of the edge).
   - `func_6` uses these functions to read each test case, constructing the graph and a list of edges.

2. **Union-Find (DSU) for Cycle Detection**:
   - The `DSU` class is used to manage the connected components of the graph. It supports `find` and `union` operations, with path compression and union by size optimizations.
   - The `union` method also keeps track of the minimum edge weight in each connected component using the `min_edge` array.

3. **Identifying Cycles**:
   - `func_6` sorts the edges in descending order of weight.
   - It then iterates over the edges, using the DSU to detect cycles. When it finds an edge that connects two nodes already in the same component, it identifies a cycle and updates the minimum edge weight if the current edge is lighter than the previously recorded minimum edge weight for that component.

4. **Depth-First Search (DFS) for Cycle Reconstruction**:
   - Once a cycle is detected, `func_6` performs a DFS starting from one of the nodes in the cycle (`node_u`).
   - The `dfs` function (`func_7`) traverses the graph, marking nodes as visited and reconstructing the cycle when it finds the other endpoint of the lightest edge (`node_v`).

5. **Output**:
   - After reconstructing the cycle, `func_6` prints the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle and the sequence of vertices in the cycle.

6. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - `func_7` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_6` for each test case, ensuring that the program processes all inputs correctly.

The program logic appears to correctly implement the required functionality. It efficiently identifies cycles using the DSU structure and reconstructs the cycle with the minimum lightest edge weight using DFS. The program handles multiple test cases as specified.

Correctness: **True**
