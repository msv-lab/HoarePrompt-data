Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect due to several reasons:

1. **Graph Representation**: The program uses a `defaultdict` to represent the graph, but it does not maintain the weights of the edges in this representation. This makes it difficult to reconstruct the cycle with the correct weights for the DFS part.

2. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Implementation**: The code references a `DSU` class which is not defined in the provided code snippet. This class is crucial for the union-find operations needed to find cycles in the graph.

3. **DFS Function**: The DFS function `dfs` is supposed to find the cycle, but it uses a global variable `graph` which is not defined within its scope. Additionally, `node_v` is also a global variable that is not defined in the scope of `dfs`.

4. **Cycle Detection**: The program attempts to find a cycle by using the DSU to detect when two vertices are part of the same component (indicating a cycle). However, the logic for finding the minimum-weight edge in the cycle and then reconstructing the cycle is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly handle the cycle reconstruction once a cycle is detected.

5. **Edge Sorting**: The edges are sorted in descending order of weight, which seems counterintuitive for finding the cycle with the minimal weight edge. The logic should be adjusted to find the cycle with the smallest weight edge.

6. **Output Handling**: The program prints the cycle and its weight, but it does not ensure that the cycle is simple (i.e., it does not revisit any vertex or edge).

To correct the program, the following changes are necessary:
- Define and implement the `DSU` class properly.
- Ensure that the graph representation includes edge weights.
- Correct the logic for cycle detection and reconstruction.
- Adjust the sorting of edges to find the cycle with the minimal weight edge.
- Ensure that the cycle is simple and correctly output the vertices in the cycle.

Given these issues, the program as provided is not correct for the given problem.
