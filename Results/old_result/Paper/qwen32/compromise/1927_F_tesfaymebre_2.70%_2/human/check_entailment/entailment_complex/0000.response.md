### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of finding a simple cycle in an undirected weighted graph such that the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle is minimal. Let's break down the program and its functions to understand if it meets the problem requirements.

1. **Input Handling (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`)**:
   - These functions are responsible for reading input from standard input. They correctly parse integers and strings from the input, which is necessary for processing the graph data.

2. **Graph Construction and Union-Find (`func_6`)**:
   - The function `func_6` reads the graph's vertices and edges, constructs the graph using an adjacency list, and sorts the edges in descending order by weight.
   - It then uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to find a cycle by attempting to union the vertices of each edge. If two vertices are already connected, it identifies a cycle and records the edge with the smallest weight.
   - The DSU structure keeps track of the minimum edge weight in each connected component, which helps in identifying the smallest edge in the cycle.

3. **Depth-First Search (`dfs`)**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to find the actual cycle starting from one of the vertices of the smallest edge identified by the DSU. It performs a DFS to traverse the graph and returns the cycle once it detects a back edge (a connection to a previously visited node that is not the parent of the current node).

4. **Main Execution (`func_7`)**:
   - The function `func_7` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_6` for each test case. It reads the number of test cases and processes each one accordingly.

### Issues and Corrections:
- **Global Variables**:
  - The `graph` variable used in the `dfs` function is not passed as a parameter. This means that `graph` is assumed to be a global variable, which is not explicitly defined within the functions. This could lead to issues if the graph is not properly initialized or if multiple test cases are processed in a way that affects the global state.
  
- **DFS Implementation**:
  - The `dfs` function modifies the `path` list in place and uses a global `colors` list to keep track of visited nodes. This is generally acceptable if the global state is managed correctly, but it should be ensured that the state is reset between test cases if necessary.
  
- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - The program assumes that the graph always contains at least one simple cycle, which is guaranteed by the problem statement. However, the implementation should be robust enough to handle any graph that meets the input constraints.

### Conclusion:
Given the provided implementation and the problem statement, the program seems to be logically correct in terms of finding a cycle with the smallest edge weight. However, the use of global variables and the assumption that the `graph` and `colors` lists are correctly managed between test cases could potentially lead to issues if not handled properly.

Since the problem guarantees that the graph always contains at least one simple cycle and the provided implementation correctly identifies and prints such a cycle, we can conclude that the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
