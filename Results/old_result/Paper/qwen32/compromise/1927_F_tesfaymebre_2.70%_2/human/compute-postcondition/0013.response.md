To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the `dfs` function call on the variables. The `dfs` function likely performs a Depth-First Search starting from `node_u` with `-1` as the parent node and an empty list as an initial path. The result of this function call is stored in the variable `res`.

Since the specific implementation of `dfs` is not provided, we can infer some general outcomes:
- `res` will hold the result returned by `dfs`.
- The variables `n`, `m`, `graph`, `edges`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `node_u`, `node_v`, and `colors` are not directly modified by the `dfs` function call, so they retain their initial values.

Given this, the output state can be described as follows:
Output State: **`n` and `m` remain the values returned by `func_3()`, `graph` is unchanged, `edges` is unchanged, `dsu` reflects the connected components, `_min_edge` is the smallest edge weight in any connected component, `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes of the edge with the smallest weight in the connected component, `colors` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `res` holds the result of `dfs(node_u, -1, [])`.**
