In the provided task, the only variable in the loop head is `test_cases`, which determines whether the loop can execute. The loop will execute as many times as the value of `test_cases`. 

To ensure that the loop executes, `test_cases` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` in the loop head is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `test_cases` to ensure that it is greater than 0.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**
