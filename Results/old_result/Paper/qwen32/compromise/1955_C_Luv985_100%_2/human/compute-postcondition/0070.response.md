The only variable in the loop head is `T`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is truthy (non-zero), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `T-1` indicates that `T` was decremented, so to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `T` must be set back to a truthy value (greater than 0).

No other states need to be adjusted as the question specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `t` (possibly modified), `n`, `k` (0 or positive), `a` (with some elements potentially 0), `l` (first non-zero index), `r` (last non-zero index), `ans` (count of fully consumed elements)**
