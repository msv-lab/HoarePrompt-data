Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 or `t` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` has been adjusted by subtracting `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `a[r]` has been adjusted by subtracting `mi`, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the conditions, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the adjustment, `ans` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the variable `l` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
