Postcondition: **`T` is greater than `number_of_iterations` minus 1, `t` is modified, `n` is at least 2, `k` is greater than 0 minus `mi * 2`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi` and `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[r]`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `l` remains 0. If `a[r]` is 0, then `ans` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decreased by 1.**
