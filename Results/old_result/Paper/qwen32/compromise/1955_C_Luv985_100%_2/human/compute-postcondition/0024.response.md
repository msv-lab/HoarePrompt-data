Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0 and `k` is now `k - mi * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi` and `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `r` is now `n - 2`, `ans` is 1 if `a[l]` is not 0, otherwise `ans` is 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is 0 if `a[l]` is not 0, otherwise `l` is 1, and `a[r]` is 0. Additionally, if `a[l]` is 0, then `a[l]` remains 0.**

Explanation: The value of `r` is decremented by 1, so `r` is now `n - 2`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
