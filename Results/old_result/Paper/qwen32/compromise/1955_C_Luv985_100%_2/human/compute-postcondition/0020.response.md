Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0 and `k` is now `k - mi * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi` and `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, and `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`. Additionally, `a[l]` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
