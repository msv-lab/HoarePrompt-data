To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state of the variable `T` since it is the only variable in the loop head. The loop condition is `while T:`, which means the loop will execute as long as `T` is not zero.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `T` is an input integer.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.
- The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

To make sure the loop executes at least once, `T` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `T` is a positive integer.

State: **`T` is a positive integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
