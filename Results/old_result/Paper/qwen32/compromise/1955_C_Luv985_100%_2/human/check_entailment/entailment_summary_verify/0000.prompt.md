You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, a large integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of elements in the list `a` that can be fully consumed by repeatedly subtracting pairs of elements from `k` until `k` is exhausted or no more valid pairs can be found. An element is considered fully consumed if its value is reduced to zero.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has a logical error that causes it to not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the code does not correctly account for all scenarios where the Kraken's attacks can sink ships, especially when the number of attacks `k` is large and the durability of the ships is such that multiple ships can be sunk in a single attack cycle.

Let's consider a specific test case to demonstrate the issue:

#### Test Case:
```
1
5 20
2 7 1 8 2
```

#### Expected Output:
```
5
```

#### Explanation of Expected Output:
- The Kraken attacks the first ship (durability 2), reducing it to 0. Ships: [7, 1, 8, 2].
- The Kraken attacks the last ship (durability 2), reducing it to 0. Ships: [7, 1, 8].
- The Kraken attacks the first ship (durability 7), reducing it to 0. Ships: [1, 8].
- The Kraken attacks the last ship (durability 8), reducing it to 0. Ships: [1].
- The Kraken attacks the first ship (durability 1), reducing it to 0. Ships: [].

All 5 ships are sunk, so the output should be 5.

#### Actual Output of the Code:
The code may not correctly handle this scenario because of the logic in the `else` block where it handles the remaining attacks when `mi * 2 > k`. The logic in the `else` block is flawed and does not correctly account for the number of ships that can be sunk in the remaining attacks.

Here's a simplified version of the problematic part of the code:
```python
else:
    t = k % 2
    if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
        ans += 1
    break
```

This part of the code does not correctly handle the situation where multiple ships can be sunk in the remaining attacks. It only checks if the first ship can be sunk with the remaining attacks, but it does not account for the possibility of sinking additional ships.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly handle all cases, specifically when the number of attacks `k` is large and multiple ships can be sunk in the remaining attacks. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
