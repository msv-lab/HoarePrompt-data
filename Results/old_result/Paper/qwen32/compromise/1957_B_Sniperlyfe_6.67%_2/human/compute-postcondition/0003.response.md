The last element of the list `nums` is incremented by the value of `k`. The other elements of `nums` and the value of `k` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`nums` is a list of `n` elements, each equal to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, except the last element which is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`, and `k` is reduced by `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` for each of the `n` iterations.**
