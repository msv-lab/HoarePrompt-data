To determine the output state, let's carefully analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet.

Initial State:
- `nums` is a list of `n` elements.
- Each element of `nums` except the last one is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
- The last element of `nums` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`.
- `k` is reduced by `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` for each of the `n` iterations.

Given the code:
```
return nums
```
The code simply returns the list `nums` as it is.

To describe the output state:
- The first `n-1` elements of `nums` are all `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
- The last element of `nums` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`.
- `k` has been reduced by `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` for each iteration, but this reduction does not affect the final state of `nums` since `nums` is already constructed based on the initial value of `k`.

Output State: **The program returns a list `nums` where the first `n-1` elements are `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the last element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`.**
