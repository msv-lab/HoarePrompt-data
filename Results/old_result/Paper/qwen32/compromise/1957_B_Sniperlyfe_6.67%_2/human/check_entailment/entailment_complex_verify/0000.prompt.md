You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and k where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `nums` is a list of `n` elements, each equal to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and `k` is reduced by `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` for each of the `n` iterations.
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` where the first `n-1` elements are `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the last element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of length `n`. The first `n-1` elements of `nums` are all equal to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and the last element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Let's analyze why the code is incorrect with an example.

The function `func_1` is supposed to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. However, the current implementation does not achieve this goal.

### Issue with the Code:
1. **Incorrect Bitwise OR Maximization**: The code attempts to set each element of the array to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`. This strategy does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the entire sequence.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Sum**: After setting the first `n-1` elements, the code adds the remaining sum `k` to the last element. This does not take into account the goal of maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Example to Demonstrate the Issue:
Consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 3`.

- The correct output could be `1 2` because `1 | 2 = 3` and `3` in binary is `11`, which has 2 ones.
- However, the current code will set the first element to `(1 << 3.bit_length() - 1) - 1 = (1 << 2) - 1 = 3` and the second element to `3 - 3 = 0`. Thus, the output will be `3 0` and `3 | 0 = 3` which is correct in terms of sum but not optimal for maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR, you should distribute the sum `k` in such a way that the binary representation of the resulting sequence has the maximum number of 1s. One way to achieve this is to use the highest possible powers of 2 that sum up to `k`.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation does not guarantee the maximum number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
