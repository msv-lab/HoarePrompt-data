Reasoning: 

The provided program does not correctly address the problem statement. The program seems to attempt to adjust the array `a` by inserting elements from `b` and removing the largest element in `a` when necessary. However, the approach and the implementation are incorrect.

Here is a breakdown of the issues in the program:

1. **Incorrect Insertion and Removal Logic:**
   - The program attempts to insert elements from `b` into `a` when `b[j] < a[i]`. However, the insertion logic is flawed. The line `a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i + 1:]` does not correctly insert `b[j]` into `a` and then sort `a` to maintain the non-decreasing order. Instead, it shifts elements and inserts `b[j]` at position `i`, which does not guarantee the non-decreasing order.
   - The line `a.pop(-1)` removes the last element of `a`, but the subsequent operations do not ensure that `a` remains sorted after the insertion.

2. **Incorrect Loop Logic:**
   - The loop increments `i` and `j` in both the `if` and `else` blocks. This logic is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the scenario where an insertion and removal are required. The correct approach would be to only increment `j` when an element from `b` is used, and increment `i` when the current element in `a` is within the expected range.

3. **Sorting Requirement:**
   - The problem requires that after each insertion, the array `a` must be sorted in non-decreasing order. The current implementation does not ensure this requirement is met.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined but not used in the main program. It attempts to sort the list in descending order, which is not relevant to the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Iterate through the elements of `a` and `b`.
- For each element in `b`, check if it is less than the current element in `a`.
- If it is, insert the element from `b` into `a` and sort `a` to maintain the non-decreasing order.
- Remove the largest element from `a` after insertion.
- Count the number of such operations required.

Given the above issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
