Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Understanding:
You need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) that maximizes the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Key Observations:
1. The function \(\gcd(x, y)\) is maximized when \( y \) is the largest possible divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x \).
2. If \( x \) is a prime number, the only divisors are 1 and \( x \) itself, so the best choice for \( y \) is 1.
3. For composite numbers, the largest divisor less than \( x \) is \( x - 1 \) if \( x - 1 \) divides \( x \). Otherwise, it's the next largest divisor.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The provided program always sets \( y = x - 1 \) and prints it for each test case. Let's check if this approach always works:

- **For prime numbers**: If \( x \) is prime, then \( \gcd(x, x-1) = 1 \). The expression \( \gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = 1 + (x-1) = x \).
- **For composite numbers**: If \( x \) is composite, \( x - 1 \) might not be a divisor of \( x \). However, choosing \( y = x - 1 \) is often a good candidate because:
  - If \( x - 1 \) is not a divisor of \( x \), the next largest divisor will be smaller, leading to a smaller \( \gcd(x, y) \).
  - If \( x - 1 \) is a divisor of \( x \), then \( \gcd(x, x-1) = x - 1 \), and the expression \( \gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = (x-1) + (x-1) = 2(x-1) \), which is usually the maximum possible value.

### Testing with Examples:
Let's test the program with the provided examples:

1. For \( x = 10 \), \( y = 9 \). \(\gcd(10, 9) = 1\), \( 1 + 9 = 10 \).
2. For \( x = 7 \), \( y = 6 \). \(\gcd(7, 6) = 1\), \( 1 + 6 = 7 \).
3. For \( x = 21 \), \( y = 20 \). \(\gcd(21, 20) = 1\), \( 1 + 20 = 21 \).
4. For \( x = 100 \), \( y = 99 \). \(\gcd(100, 99) = 1\), \( 1 + 99 = 100 \).
5. For \( x = 2 \), \( y = 1 \). \(\gcd(2, 1) = 1\), \( 1 + 1 = 2 \).
6. For \( x = 1000 \), \( y = 999 \). \(\gcd(1000, 999) = 1\), \( 1 + 999 = 1000 \).
7. For \( x = 6 \), \( y = 5 \). \(\gcd(6, 5) = 1\), \( 1 + 5 = 6 \).

In all these cases, the program's output is correct because \( y = x - 1 \) leads to a maximum possible value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Conclusion:
The provided program works correctly for the given problem constraints and examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
