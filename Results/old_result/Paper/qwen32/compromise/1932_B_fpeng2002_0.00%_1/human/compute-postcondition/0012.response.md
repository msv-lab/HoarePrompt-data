To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the `start_year` is updated in each iteration. The loop iterates over each element in the `nums` list, updating `start_year` according to the formula:

\[ \text{start\_year} = \left(\left(\frac{\text{start\_year} + 1}{\text{nums}[x]} + 1\right) \times \text{nums}[x]\right) \]

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that after all iterations, `start_year` will be updated based on all elements in the `nums` list. Let's formalize this:

1. **Initial State**: `start_year` is set to 0.
2. **After 1st iteration**: `start_year` becomes `nums[0]`.
3. **After 2nd iteration**: `start_year` becomes `((nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`.
4. **After 3rd iteration**: `start_year` becomes `((start_year + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`.

Following this pattern, after the loop has executed for all elements in the `nums` list, `start_year` will be updated to:

\[ \text{start\_year} = \left(\left(\frac{\text{start\_year} + 1}{\text{nums}[\text{len(nums)}-1]} + 1\right) \times \text{nums}[\text{len(nums)}-1]\right) \]

Where `start_year` is the value computed from the previous iterations.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`start_year` is the value computed after processing all elements in the `nums` list according to the given formula, `num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers, and `x` is the last index of the `nums` list.**

In simpler terms, `start_year` will be the final computed value after all iterations of the loop, and all other variables will remain as described in the initial state except that `num_tests` will have been decremented by 1.
