To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in the provided code is:

```python
for x in range(0, len(nums)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables in the loop head are `x` and the result of `len(nums)`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `len(nums)` is greater than 0. Therefore, the key variable to adjust is `nums` to ensure it has at least one element. The variable `x` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function, so it does not need to be adjusted in the initial state.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`start_year` is 0, `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `x` is 0**

Note that `x` is set to 0 because that is the starting value of the loop variable as defined by the `range(0, len(nums))`. However, since `x` is re-initialized by the loop, its initial value before the loop doesn't affect the loop's execution.
