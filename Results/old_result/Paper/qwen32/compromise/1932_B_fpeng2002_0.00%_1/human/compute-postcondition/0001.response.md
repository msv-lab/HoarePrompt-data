To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `num_tests > 0` is satisfied. The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one.

Given the state right before the loop is that `num_tests` is an integer representing the number of test cases, we need to ensure that `num_tests` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`num_tests` must be greater than 0**
