Output State: **`start_year` is `((nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`, `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `x` is 1`**

In natural language: The value of `start_year` has been updated to `((nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`. The value of `num_tests` is still `num_tests - 1`, `n` remains an input integer, `nums` retains its list of integers, and `x` remains 1.
