The code snippet decrements the value of `num_tests` by 1. The other variables (`start_year`, `n`, `nums`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start_year` is the result of the last iteration's formula, `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and `x` is `len(nums) - 1`**.
