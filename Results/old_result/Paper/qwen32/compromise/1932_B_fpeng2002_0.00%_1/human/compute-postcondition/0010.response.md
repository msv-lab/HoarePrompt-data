The only variables in the loop head are `x` and the range parameters `0` and `len(nums)`. Since the range parameters do not change during the loop, we only need to adjust the value of `x` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was 1. Since `x` is the loop variable that is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the next iteration, `x` should be 2. The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, `start_year`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted.

State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `start_year` is `((nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`, `x` is 2**
