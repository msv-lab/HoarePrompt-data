The code updates the value of `start_year` based on its previous value, the value of `nums[x]`, and the integer division and addition operations. The other variables (`num_tests` and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state, `start_year` is 0, and `nums[x]` is some integer from the list `nums`. The expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` calculates the new value of `start_year`.

Let's break down the expression:
- `start_year + 1` is `1` because `start_year` is `0`.
- `1 // nums[x]` will be `0` because `1` divided by any integer greater than `1` will result in `0` (integer division).
- Adding `1` to the result gives `1`.
- Multiplying `1` by `nums[x]` gives `nums[x]`.

Therefore, the new value of `start_year` is `nums[x]`.

Output State: **`start_year` is `nums[x]`, `num_tests` is a positive integer less than its previous value, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element**.
