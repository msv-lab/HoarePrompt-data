To determine what will be printed by the `print(start_year)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state:

- `start_year` is the result of the last iteration's formula.
- `num_tests` is a positive integer less than its previous value.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element.
- `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.

However, the initial state does not provide an explicit value for `start_year` or the result of the last iteration's formula. Therefore, we can only describe `start_year` based on the information given.

Given that `start_year` is the result of the last iteration's formula, its exact value depends on the specific computation performed in the last iteration. Since this information is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of the context given.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the result of the last iteration's formula)**
