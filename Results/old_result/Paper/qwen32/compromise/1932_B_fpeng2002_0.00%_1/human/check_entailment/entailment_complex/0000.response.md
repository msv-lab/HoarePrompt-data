Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to solve the problem by simulating the sequential occurrence of signs based on their periodicities. The logic used in the program is to start from year 0 and, for each sign, determine the next occurrence year that is strictly after the previous sign's occurrence year. This is done by calculating the smallest multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is greater than the current year.

Let's break down the logic:
1. `start_year = 0`: Initializes the starting year to 0.
2. For each sign's periodicity `nums[x]`, it calculates the next occurrence year using the formula `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
   - `start_year + 1`: Ensures we are looking for the next occurrence strictly after the current `start_year`.
   - `(start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1`: Finds the next multiple of `nums[x]` after `start_year`.
   - `* nums[x]`: Converts the multiple back to the actual year.

This logic correctly simulates the sequential occurrence of signs based on their periodicities. The program iterates through each test case and calculates the year for the n-th sign's occurrence correctly as per the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
