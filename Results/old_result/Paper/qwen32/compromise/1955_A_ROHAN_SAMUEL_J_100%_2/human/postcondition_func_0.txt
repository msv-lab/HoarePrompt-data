The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it computes and prints a value based on the relationship between `n`, `a`, and `b`. Specifically, it prints the minimum cost to achieve a certain configuration, either by using `a` for each unit or using `b` for pairs, considering whether `n` is odd or even.
