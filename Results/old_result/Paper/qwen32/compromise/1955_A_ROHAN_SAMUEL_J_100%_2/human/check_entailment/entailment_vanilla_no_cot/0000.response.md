Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts under promotion). The goal is to determine the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

The logic in the program is as follows:
- If `n` is odd, it checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`b`) is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`). If it is cheaper, it calculates the cost as `(n // 2) * b + a` (buying `n // 2` pairs at `b` and one yogurt at `a`). If not, it calculates the cost as `a * n` (buying all yogurts at the regular price).
- If `n` is even, it similarly checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`b`) is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`). If it is cheaper, it calculates the cost as `(n // 2) * b`. If not, it calculates the cost as `a * n`.

This logic is correct. It effectively checks the cost for both buying yogurts individually and in pairs and chooses the cheaper option.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
