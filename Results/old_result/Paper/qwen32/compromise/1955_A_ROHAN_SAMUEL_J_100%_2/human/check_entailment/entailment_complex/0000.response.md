### Reasoning:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts, considering the promotion for buying two yogurts at a discount.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts with promotion).

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n` is odd:
     - It checks if the cost of buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`b`) is cheaper than buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying yogurts individually is cheaper. Therefore, the cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and buys the remaining yogurt individually. The cost is `n // 2 * b + a`.
   - If `n` is even:
     - It again checks if the cost of buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`b`) is cheaper than buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying yogurts individually is cheaper. Therefore, the cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it buys all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price. The cost is `n // 2 * b`.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

The program handles all edge cases, including:
- When `n` is 1.
- When `n` is even.
- When `n` is odd.
- When the promotion price (`b`) is cheaper than buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`).
- When buying yogurts individually is cheaper than the promotion price.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case based on the given conditions and constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
