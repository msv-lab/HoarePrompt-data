You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it computes and prints a value based on the relationship between `n`, `a`, and `b`. Specifically, it prints the minimum cost to achieve a certain configuration, either by using `a` for each unit or using `b` for pairs, considering whether `n` is odd or even.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The program's logic is as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts `n`, the price of one yogurt `a`, and the price of two yogurts on promotion `b`.
3. It then determines the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts:
   - If `n` is odd, it checks if buying two yogurts separately (2 * a) is cheaper than the promotion price `b`. If it is, it buys all yogurts at the regular price. Otherwise, it buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and buys the remaining single yogurt at the regular price.
   - If `n` is even, it again checks if buying two yogurts separately (2 * a) is cheaper than the promotion price `b`. If it is, it buys all yogurts at the regular price. Otherwise, it buys all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.

Let's verify this logic with the example provided in the problem:

1. For `n = 2, a = 5, b = 9`:
   - Since `n` is even, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 9), which is false. So, it buys both yogurts at the promotion price, resulting in `9` burles.

2. For `n = 3, a = 5, b = 9`:
   - Since `n` is odd, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 9), which is false. So, it buys one pair of yogurts at the promotion price and one yogurt at the regular price, resulting in `9 + 5 = 14` burles.

3. For `n = 3, a = 5, b = 11`:
   - Since `n` is odd, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 11), which is true. So, it buys all yogurts at the regular price, resulting in `5 * 3 = 15` burles.

4. For `n = 4, a = 5, b = 11`:
   - Since `n` is even, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 11), which is true. So, it buys all yogurts at the regular price, resulting in `5 * 4 = 20` burles.

The program's logic seems to correctly compute the minimum cost for each test case as per the examples provided.

Therefore, the program is correct.
