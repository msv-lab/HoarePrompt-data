### Reasoning:
To determine if the program is correct, we need to verify that it correctly computes the minimum cost for each test case based on the given rules:

1. **When `n` is even**:
   - If the cost of buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`b`) is less than buying them individually (`2 * a`), then the cost should be `(n // 2) * b`.
   - Otherwise, the cost should be `n * a`.

2. **When `n` is odd**:
   - If the cost of buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`b`) is less than buying them individually (`2 * a`), then the cost should be `(n // 2) * b + a` (buying `n - 1` yogurts in pairs and the last one individually).
   - Otherwise, the cost should be `n * a`.

The provided program follows these rules correctly:
- It checks if `n` is odd or even.
- It compares `2 * a` and `b` to decide whether to use the promotion price for pairs or not.
- It calculates the cost accordingly and prints it.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the example provided:

1. **Test case: `n = 2, a = 5, b = 9`**
   - Since `n` is even, it checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 9 is False).
   - Therefore, it uses the promotion price: `2 // 2 * 9 = 9`.

2. **Test case: `n = 3, a = 5, b = 9`**
   - Since `n` is odd, it checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 9 is False).
   - Therefore, it uses the promotion price for two yogurts and buys one individually: `3 // 2 * 9 + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14`.

3. **Test case: `n = 3, a = 5, b = 11`**
   - Since `n` is odd, it checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 11 is True).
   - Therefore, it buys all yogurts individually: `3 * 5 = 15`.

4. **Test case: `n = 4, a = 5, b = 11`**
   - Since `n` is even, it checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 11 is True).
   - Therefore, it buys all yogurts individually: `4 * 5 = 20`.

The program produces the correct output for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts based on the given conditions.

### Correctness: **True**
