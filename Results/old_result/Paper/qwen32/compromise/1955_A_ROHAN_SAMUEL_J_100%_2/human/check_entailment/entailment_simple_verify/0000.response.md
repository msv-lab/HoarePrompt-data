### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the program using the provided annotations and the original assessment.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts.
   - The price for one yogurt is `a` burles.
   - The price for two yogurts in promotion is `b` burles.
   - The goal is to find the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It checks if `n` is odd or even.
   - If `n` is odd:
     - It checks if `2 * a < b`. If true, it prints `a * n` (buying all yogurts individually).
     - Otherwise, it prints `(n // 2) * b + a` (buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and one yogurt individually).
   - If `n` is even:
     - It checks if `2 * a < b`. If true, it prints `a * n` (buying all yogurts individually).
     - Otherwise, it prints `(n // 2) * b` (buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price).

3. **Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment claims that the program does not handle all cases correctly, specifically when `n` is even.
   - It argues that the program does not consider the promotion for even `n` if `2 * a >= b`.

4. **Verification Using Annotations:**
   - Let's verify the problematic part of the code with annotations.
   - For `n` odd:
     - `if n % 2`: The program correctly checks if `2 * a < b` and handles both cases.
   - For `n` even:
     - `elif 2 * a < b`: The program checks if `2 * a < b` and buys all yogurts individually if true.
     - `else`: The program buys all yogurts in pairs if `2 * a >= b`.

5. **Counterexample Analysis:**
   - The counterexample given is:
     - Input: `4 5 9`
     - Expected Output: `18`
     - Actual Output: `20`
   - The program correctly computes `20` because `2 * 5 = 10` is not less than `9`, so it buys 2 pairs at `9` burles each, resulting in `18` burles.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment is incorrect because the program does handle both odd and even `n` correctly.
   - The program correctly computes the minimum cost by considering the promotion for even `n` when `2 * a >= b`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
