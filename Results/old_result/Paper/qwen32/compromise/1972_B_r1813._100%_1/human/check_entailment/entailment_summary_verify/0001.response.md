### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a circular arrangement of coins, each of which can be either facing up ("U") or facing down ("D").
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins.
   - The game ends when no more facing-up coins are left, and the player who cannot make a move loses.
   - We need to determine if Alice (the first player) will win if both players play optimally.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game's outcome depends on the number of facing-up coins ("U").
   - If the number of "U" coins is odd, Alice will always win.
   - If the number of "U" coins is even, Bob will always win.

3. **Explanation for the Insight:**
   - Each move removes one "U" coin and potentially flips adjacent coins, which can change the count of "U" coins.
   - If the count of "U" coins is odd, Alice can always make the last move, leaving Bob with an even count of "U" coins, which will eventually lead to Bob's loss.
   - Conversely, if the count of "U" coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice is left with an even count of "U" coins, leading to Alice's loss.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it counts the number of "U" coins in the string.
   - If the count of "U" coins is odd, it prints "YES" (indicating Alice wins).
   - If the count of "U" coins is even, it prints "NO" (indicating Bob wins).

5. **Verification Against Example:**
   - For the first test case (`UUDUD`), there are 3 "U" coins (odd), so the output is "YES".
   - For the second test case (`UDDUD`), there are 2 "U" coins (even), so the output is "NO".
   - For the third test case (`UU`), there are 2 "U" coins (even), so the output is "NO".

6. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads multiple test cases and processes each one by counting the number of "U" coins.
   - It then prints "YES" if the count is odd and "NO" if the count is even, which aligns with the key insight.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic based on the number of "U" coins and produces the expected results for the given examples.

Final: **True**
