You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function receives two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

    #State: The output state consists of `T` lines, each containing either 'Alice' or 'Bob', determined by the comparisons of the input pairs `a` and `b` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have, respectively. It then prints "Alice" or "Bob" based on specific conditions related to the values of `a` and `b`. The final state of the program is that it outputs `t` lines, each indicating the winner ("Alice" or "Bob") for the corresponding test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Program Analysis

The problem involves a game where Alice and Bob take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins until one of them cannot make a move. The key to solving this problem is understanding the optimal strategy for both players.

#### Key Points:
1. **Optimal Strategy**:
    - If `a == b`, the player who starts (Alice) will always lose because no matter what they do, they will eventually reach a state where both wallets have the same number of coins, and the opponent will force them to lose.
    - If `a == 1` or `b == 1`, the player who starts with 1 coin will lose because they cannot remove a coin from their wallet.
    - If `a % 2 == 1` (odd) and `b % 2 == 0` (even), Alice can always force Bob into a losing position.
    - If `a % 2 == 0` (even) and `b % 2 == 1` (odd), Bob can always force Alice into a losing position.
    - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the strategy is more complex, but generally, the player who starts with the larger number of coins can force a win.
    - If both `a` and `b` are even and `a > b`, Bob can force Alice into a losing position by mirroring her moves.
    - If both `a` and `b` are even and `a < b`, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by mirroring his moves.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Condition for `a % 2 == 1`**: This condition is incorrect. If `a` is odd and `b` is even, Alice can force Bob into a losing position, not Bob.
2. **Condition for `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`**: This condition is also incorrect. If `a` is even and `b` is odd, Bob can force Alice into a losing position, not Alice.
3. **Conditions for `a > b` and `a < b` when both are even**: These conditions do not properly account for the mirroring strategy that can force a win for the larger number of coins.

### Correctness: **False**

### Explanation of Incorrectness:
The provided program incorrectly handles cases where `a` and `b` have different parities (odd/even) and when both are even but not equal. Here is a counterexample:

- **Counterexample**: `a = 3`, `b = 2`
    - According to the program, the output will be `Bob` because `a % 2 == 1`.
    - However, Alice can swap wallets, making `a = 2` and `b = 3`. Then, Bob will be forced into a losing position because he will always be left with an odd number of coins while Alice can always mirror his moves until Bob cannot make a move.

Thus, the program does not correctly determine the winner for every potential case, making it incorrect.
