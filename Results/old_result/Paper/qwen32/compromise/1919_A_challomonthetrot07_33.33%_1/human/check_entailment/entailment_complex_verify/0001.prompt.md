You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function receives two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

    #State: The output state consists of `T` lines, each containing either 'Alice' or 'Bob', determined by the comparisons of the input pairs `a` and `b` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have, respectively. It then prints "Alice" or "Bob" based on specific conditions related to the values of `a` and `b`. The final state of the program is that it outputs `t` lines, each indicating the winner ("Alice" or "Bob") for the corresponding test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the logic of the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Base Case: a == b**
   - If Alice and Bob have the same number of coins, Alice will always lose if both play optimally. This is because no matter what Alice does, Bob can mirror her moves, and Alice will end up in a position where she cannot make a move first. Hence, the program correctly prints 'Bob'.

2. **Case: a == 1**
   - If Alice has only one coin, she will lose because she can only take one coin out of her wallet, leaving Bob with the same number of coins as before. Bob can then mirror Alice's moves and win. The program correctly prints 'Alice'.

3. **Case: b == 1**
   - If Bob has only one coin, the logic is similar to the previous case. Alice can swap wallets with Bob, leaving Bob with no coins and Alice with the same number of coins. Alice can then mirror Bob's moves and win. The program correctly prints 'Bob'.

4. **Case: a % 2 == 1 (a is odd)**
   - If Alice has an odd number of coins, she can always leave Bob with an even number of coins after her first move by swapping wallets if necessary. Bob will then be in a position where he has an even number of coins, and Alice can always mirror his moves to ensure that she wins. The program correctly prints 'Bob'.

5. **Case: a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1 (a is even and b is odd)**
   - If Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins, Alice can always leave Bob with an even number of coins after her first move by swapping wallets if necessary. Bob will then be in a position where he has an even number of coins, and Alice can always mirror his moves to ensure that she wins. The program correctly prints 'Alice'.

6. **Case: a > b**
   - The program prints 'Bob' if Alice has more coins than Bob. However, this does not necessarily mean Bob will win. If Alice has more coins, she can swap wallets to put Bob in a more disadvantageous position, but the logic needs to consider the parity (odd/even nature) of the coins, which is already handled by the previous cases. This case does not cover all scenarios and can lead to incorrect results.

7. **Case: else (a < b)**
   - The program prints 'Alice' if Bob has more coins than Alice. Similar to the previous case, this does not necessarily mean Alice will win. Bob can swap wallets to put Alice in a more disadvantageous position, but the logic needs to consider the parity (odd/even nature) of the coins, which is already handled by the previous cases. This case does not cover all scenarios and can lead to incorrect results.

**Conclusion:**
The program does not correctly handle all scenarios, especially when comparing `a > b` and `a < b` without considering the parity of the coin counts. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
