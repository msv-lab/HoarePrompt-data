Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins. The second line contains a string `s` of length `n`, consisting only of characters "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin facing up and "D" indicates a coin facing down.**

Explanation: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first input, which is the number of test cases. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged as the code provided only reads the first line of input.
