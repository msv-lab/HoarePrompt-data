Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`.**

In this context, `cats_to_add` represents the count of positions where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1', and `cats_to_remove` represents the count of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'. The program returns the larger of these two counts.
