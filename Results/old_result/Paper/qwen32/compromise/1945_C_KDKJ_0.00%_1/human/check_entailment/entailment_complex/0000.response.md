### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the optimal position to place a road that divides the village into left and right sides such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side. The residents' preferences are given as a binary string where '0' indicates a preference for the left side and '1' indicates a preference for the right side.

#### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - **Input**: Reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n`.
    - **Process**:
        - Constructs a list `S` where `S[i]` contains the cumulative count of '0's and '1's up to the `i`-th house.
        - Iterates over possible positions `i` to place the road.
        - For each position `i`, calculates the number of '0's (`left`) and '1's (`right`) on the left and right sides of the road, respectively.
        - Checks if the conditions for satisfaction are met on both sides (i.e., at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied).
        - Tracks the position `i` that is closest to the middle of the village while satisfying the conditions.
    - **Output**: Prints the position `ans` where the road should be placed.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - **Process**: Reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
    - **Output**: The output for each test case is handled within `func_1`.

#### Analysis:
- The code correctly constructs the cumulative count list `S` to efficiently determine the number of '0's and '1's on both sides of the road for any given position `i`.
- The conditions for satisfaction are correctly implemented by checking if the number of '0's on the left side is at least half of the total number of houses on the left side and if the number of '1's on the right side is at least half of the total number of houses on the right side.
- The code correctly identifies the position `i` that is closest to the middle while satisfying the conditions.
- The code handles multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided code meets all the requirements of the problem statement and correctly determines the optimal position to place the road.
