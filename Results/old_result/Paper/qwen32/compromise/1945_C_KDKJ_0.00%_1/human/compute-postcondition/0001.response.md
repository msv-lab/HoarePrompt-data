To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided loop and understand its behavior. The loop is defined as follows:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

Here, the loop will execute the function `func_1()` a number of times equal to the integer value provided by the user input. The loop variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't intend to use within the loop body. Since the loop variable `_` is not used inside the loop, it does not affect the state of the program in any meaningful way. The only action taken in each iteration of the loop is the execution of `func_1()`.

However, since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided code, we cannot determine its side effects or how it modifies the state. Therefore, based on the information given, the only thing we can conclude is that `func_1()` will be called a certain number of times, but we cannot determine what specific changes, if any, this will cause to the program's state.

Given that no variables are present in the function signature of `func_2` (which is not even used in the provided code), and no other variables are mentioned, the output state can only be described in terms of the execution of `func_1()`.

Output State: **The function `func_1()` is executed `int(input())` times, but the specific state changes depend on the implementation of `func_1()`. No other variables are affected.**
