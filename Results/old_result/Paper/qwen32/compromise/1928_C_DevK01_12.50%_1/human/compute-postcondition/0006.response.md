To address the problem, let's first correct the issues in the provided code snippet and then determine the final state after the loop executes.

### Issues in the Provided Code:
1. **TypeError**: The code attempts to call `math.sqrt()` with a list, which causes a `TypeError`. However, `math.sqrt()` is not actually present in the snippet, so we'll focus on the rest of the code.
2. **Loop Head**: The loop head `for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):` is problematic. The expression `int(w // 1)` is equivalent to `int(w)`, which means the loop will iterate from 1 to `w - 1`. If `w` is 1, the loop will not execute at all.
3. **Variable `q`**: The variable `q` is a list of tuples, but the loop uses `q` as if it were an integer. This will cause an error because you cannot use the modulus operator `%` with a list and an integer.
4. **Variable `x`**: The variable `x` is used inside the loop, but it is not defined within the loop scope. It should be derived from the tuple in the list `q`.

### Corrected Code:
To correct the code, we need to iterate over each tuple in the list `q` and perform the operations on the individual `n` and `x` values. We will also need to handle the list `M` correctly based on the conditions provided.

Here is the corrected version of the loop:

```python
import math

# Assuming q is a list of tuples (n, x)
q = [(10, 3), (20, 5)]  # Example input
M = []

for n, x in q:
    w = int(math.sqrt(n))  # Example value for w, derived from n
    for i in range(1, w):
        if n % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M.append(i)
            if n // i >= x - 1:
                M.append(n // i)

# Output State
Output State: **M is a list containing the divisors of n that meet the conditions.**
```

### Explanation:
- For each tuple `(n, x)` in the list `q`, we calculate `w` as the integer square root of `n`.
- We then iterate over all integers `i` from 1 to `w - 1`.
- If `n` is divisible by `i`, we check if `i` or `n // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, we add them to the list `M`.

### Output State:
After the loop executes, the list `M` will contain all the divisors of `n` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

Output State: **M is a list containing the divisors of n that meet the conditions.**
