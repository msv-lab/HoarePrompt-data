The code snippet `M += [w]` appends the value of `w` to the list `M`. The initial state indicates that `M` is an empty list, and `w` is an integer. After the execution of the code, `M` will contain one element, which is the value of `w`.

Output State: **The program raises a TypeError because `math.sqrt()` is called with a list instead of a number. `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is a list containing the integer `w`; `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
