Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step to determine if the given program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Understanding the Settling Process**:
   - The sequence of numbers repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - The first `k` numbers are `1, 2, 3, ..., k`.
   - The next `k - 2` numbers are `k-1, k-2, ..., 2`.
   - This pattern repeats.

2. **Objective**:
   - Given Vasya's position `n` and the number `x` he received, find all possible values of `k` that could generate this sequence.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - For a given `k`, Vasya's position `n` and number `x` must satisfy the sequence pattern.
   - The sequence length is `2k - 2`, so `n` must fit within these cycles.
   - The value of `x` within a cycle depends on the position `n` modulo `2k - 2`.

### Code Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`.
   - If `y` is odd, the program immediately prints `0` because the sequence length `2k - 2` must be even.
   - If `y` is even, the program calls `func_1` to find possible `k` values.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it calls `func_1` again with a different argument.
   - The results from `func_1` are combined, duplicates are removed, and the length of the resulting list is printed.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function finds divisors of `q` that are at least `x - 1`.
   - It includes both the divisor and its complement if they are valid.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding `k`**:
   - The logic for finding `k` is not directly related to the sequence pattern described in the problem.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find divisors of `q` that fit the pattern, but it does not consider the position `n` within the sequence cycle.

2. **Incorrect Handling of `n` and `x`**:
   - The program does not correctly map the position `n` and number `x` to the sequence pattern.
   - It does not consider the cycle length `2k - 2` and how `n` fits within these cycles.

3. **Incorrect Use of `y`**:
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`, but it is not clear how this value is used to determine `k`.
   - The condition `y % 2 != 0` is correct for ensuring the sequence length is even, but the subsequent logic is flawed.

### Correctness

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find all possible values of `k` based on the given position `n` and number `x`.

**Correctness: False**

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly determine the number of possible `k` values that fit the given constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
