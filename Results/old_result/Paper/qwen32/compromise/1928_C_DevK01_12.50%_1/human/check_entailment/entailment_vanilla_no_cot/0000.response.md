To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The task involves determining the number of possible values of `k` such that a person in position `n` receives number `x` in a specific numbering pattern. The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and it alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of numbers from `1` to `k` and back down to `2`.

### Key Points:
1. **Pattern Repetition**: The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
2. **Position Calculation**: For a given position `n`, we need to determine if `x` can be the number assigned to that position in the pattern for any `k`.
3. **Constraints**: `k > 1`, `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses the following approach:
1. **Input Parsing**: Reads the number of test cases and the values of `n` and `x` for each test case.
2. **Initial Check**: Checks if `n + x` is even. If not, it immediately returns `0` because the pattern can only produce even sums of positions and numbers in certain configurations.
3. **Helper Function `func_1`**: This function calculates potential values of `k` based on the given formula and conditions.
4. **Combining Results**: Combines results from `func_1` for different conditions and counts unique values of `k`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Logic in `func_1`**: The logic for calculating potential `k` values seems flawed. The function calculates divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2`, but the conditions for adding these values to the list `M` are not clearly derived from the problem constraints.
2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly, especially when `n` and `x` are large.
3. **Correctness of `func_1`**: The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to find all valid `k` values based on the given problem description.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. The helper function `func_1` and the way it is used in the main loop do not accurately reflect the required conditions for determining valid `k` values.

**Correctness: False**
