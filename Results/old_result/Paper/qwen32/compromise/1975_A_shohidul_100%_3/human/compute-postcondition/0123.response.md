To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case based on the provided logic.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Loop Iteration**: The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Input Processing**: For each iteration, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers.
3. **Check Sorted Order**: It checks if the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order using `check_all`.
4. **Decision Making**:
   - If `check_all` is `True`, it prints 'YES'.
   - If `check_all` is `False`, it checks two conditions:
     - `check_all_new`: Whether the first element of `a` is greater than or equal to every element in the sublist `new` (which starts from the first element where the order breaks).
     - `new_all`: Whether the sublist `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
     - If both conditions are `True`, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the inner loop.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the inner loop.

After processing all `t` test cases, the loop will have printed either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.

### Final Output State
The final output state will reflect the results of all `t` test cases. Since the loop processes each test case independently and prints the result immediately, the final output state is simply the concatenation of the outputs ('YES' or 'NO') for each of the `t` test cases.

Output State: **The final output state consists of `t` lines, each containing either 'YES' or 'NO', corresponding to the result of each test case.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the program will have printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each of the `t` test cases, and there are no additional changes to the state of any variables outside of the loop.
