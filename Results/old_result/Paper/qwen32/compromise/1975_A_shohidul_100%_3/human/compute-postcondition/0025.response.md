The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides several variables and conditions but does not influence the output of this specific `print` statement. Here's a breakdown:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `check_all` is set to False.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `new` is a list containing elements from index 2 to the end of `a`.
- `check_all_new` is determined based on whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`.
- `new_all` is determined based on whether each element in `new` is greater than or equal to the preceding element.

However, none of these variables or conditions affect the `print('YES')` statement directly. The statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
