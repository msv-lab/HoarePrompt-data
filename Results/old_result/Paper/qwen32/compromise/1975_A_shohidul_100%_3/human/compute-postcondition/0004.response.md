The code checks if the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing each element with its predecessor. The variable `check_all` is assigned the result of this check.

Given the initial state, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is a list of integers. The variable `check_all` is introduced and assigned a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order.**
