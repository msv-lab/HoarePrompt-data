Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, then `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end of `a`, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of regardless of whether `check_all_new` and `new_all` are true or false.**
