Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
    if check_all:
        print('YES')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                new = a[i:]
                check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))]
                    )
                new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len
                    (new))])
                if check_all_new and new_all:
                    print('YES')
                    break
                else:
                    print('NO')
                    break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `check_all` is True, it confirms that the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `check_all` is False, it indicates that the list `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 1; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `check_all` is True, the program continues with the existing state of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `check_all`. If `check_all` is False, `i` is set to the value of `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `check_all` is `True` if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `check_all` is `False`. If `check_all` is `True`, the program may perform certain actions (not specified in the if part). If `check_all` is `False`, the loop completes all iterations without printing 'YES'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
