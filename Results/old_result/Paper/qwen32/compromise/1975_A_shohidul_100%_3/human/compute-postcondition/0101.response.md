To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `check_all` is `False` if `a[i - 1] > a[i]`.
- If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, `i` is an index where `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, and `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end.
- The most internal loop or if statement is broken if both `check_all_new` (where `a[0] >= new[j]` for all `j` in the range of `len(new)`) and `new_all` (where `new` is non-decreasing) are `True`. Otherwise, either `check_all_new` or `new_all` is `False`, and the most internal loop or if statement is also broken.
- If `a[i - 1] <= a[i]`, the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

Since `n` does not change throughout the loop, it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**

However, since we don't have the specific value of `i_prev`, we can generalize it as follows:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**

If we assume `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`. Since we don't have `i_prev`, we can just say `i` is incremented by 1.

So the final state can be written as:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**

For clarity, let's assume `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3. But since we don't have the exact value, we use the generalized form.

Final Answer:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**
