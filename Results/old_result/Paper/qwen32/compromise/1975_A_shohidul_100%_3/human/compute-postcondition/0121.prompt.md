Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `check_all` is `True` if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `check_all` is `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, and `check_all` is `False` if `a[i - 1] > a[i]`. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, `i` is an index where `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, and `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end. The most internal loop or if statement is broken if both `check_all_new` (where `a[0] >= new[j]` for all `j` in the range of `len(new)`) and `new_all` (where `new` is non-decreasing) are `True`. Otherwise, either `check_all_new` or `new_all` is `False`, and the most internal loop or if statement is also broken. If `a[i - 1] <= a[i]`, the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of `a`, `check_all_new` is a boolean indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, `new_all` is `True` if every element in `new` is less than or equal to the next element, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of regardless of whether `check_all_new` and `new_all` are true or false. If `a[i - 1] <= a[i]`, no additional changes are made to `new`, `check_all_new`, or `new_all`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of `a`, `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of whether `check_all_new and new_all` is true or false.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
