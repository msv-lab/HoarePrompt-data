Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `i` is `i + 1`; `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end; `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`; `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
