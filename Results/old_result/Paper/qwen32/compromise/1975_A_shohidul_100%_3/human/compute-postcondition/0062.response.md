The code snippet `new = a[i:]` creates a new list `new` that contains all elements of the list `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list `a`. 

Given the initial state, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, so the slice `a[i:]` will start from the element at the new index `i`.

Since `a` is a list of integers and `i` is incremented by 1, the new list `new` will contain all elements of `a` starting from the element at the new index `i` to the last element of `a`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `check_all`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end of `a`.**
