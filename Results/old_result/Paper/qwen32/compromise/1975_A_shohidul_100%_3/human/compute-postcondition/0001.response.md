In the given for loop, the loop variable is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use inside the loop. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases.

To ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `_` does not need to be initialized or adjusted because it is automatically assigned values from the range during each iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure that it is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
