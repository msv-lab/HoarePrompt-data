Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 1; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `a[i-1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then `new` is a list containing elements from `a[i:]`, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, and `new_all` is False. The most internal loop or if statement is broken due to either `check_all_new` being False or `new_all` being False (or both). If `a[i-1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, no changes are made to `new`, `check_all_new`, or `new_all`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, then `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end of `a`, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of regardless of whether `check_all_new` and `new_all` are true or false.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, then `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end; `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`; `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order; and the most internal loop or if statement is exited regardless of whether `check_all_new and new_all` is true or false.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
