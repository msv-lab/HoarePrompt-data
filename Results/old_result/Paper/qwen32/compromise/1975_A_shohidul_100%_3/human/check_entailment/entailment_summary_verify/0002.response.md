### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem described.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where we split the array into two parts and swap them. Specifically, we need to check if there exists a way to split the array such that:
1. The first part (prefix) is less than or equal to the second part (suffix) when concatenated in reverse order.
2. The second part (suffix) is already sorted in non-decreasing order.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve this problem with the following logic:
1. **Check if Already Sorted**: The program first checks if the array is already sorted using `check_all`. If true, it prints "YES".
2. **Finding the Split Point**: If the array is not sorted, the program iterates through the array to find the first point where `a[i-1] > a[i]`. Once found, it considers the suffix starting from index `i` (`new = a[i:]`).
3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - `check_all_new`: Checks if the first element of the original array (`a[0]`) is greater than or equal to every element in the suffix.
   - `new_all`: Checks if the suffix itself is sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. **Decision Making**:
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Multiple "NO" Outputs**: The program might print "NO" multiple times if there are multiple points where `a[i-1] > a[i]`, which is incorrect.
2. **Logic Flaw**: The condition `check_all_new` is insufficient. It only checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to every element in the suffix, but it doesn't ensure that the entire prefix (before the split point) is greater than or equal to the suffix.
3. **Single Check**: The program should only print "NO" once after checking all possible split points, not immediately after finding one invalid split point.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Check if the array is already sorted.
2. If not, iterate through all possible split points and check if the array can be split such that:
   - The suffix is sorted.
   - The entire prefix is less than or equal to the suffix when concatenated in reverse order.

#### Revised Program Logic:
Here is a revised version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if already sorted
        if all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)):
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        # Try all possible split points
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                # Check if the suffix is sorted
                if all(a[j] <= a[j + 1] for j in range(i, n - 1)):
                    # Check if the entire prefix is less than or equal to the suffix
                    if all(a[k] <= a[i] for k in range(i)):
                        print('YES')
                        break
                else:
                    continue
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
# func()
```

#### Conclusion:
The original program has significant logical flaws and does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the program as incorrect.

**Final: False**
