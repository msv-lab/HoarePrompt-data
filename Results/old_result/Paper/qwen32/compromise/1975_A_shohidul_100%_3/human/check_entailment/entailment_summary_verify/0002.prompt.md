You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the array is non-decreasing or can be made non-decreasing by removing a prefix. It outputs 'YES' if either condition is met, otherwise 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to determine if the array `a` can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where we split the array into two parts and swap them.

### Key Observations:
1. **Already Sorted**: If the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, the answer is trivially "Yes".
2. **Split and Swap**: For the array to be sortable by splitting and swapping, there must exist a point where the array can be split such that:
   - The first part (prefix) is greater than or equal to the first element of the second part (suffix).
   - The second part (suffix) is already sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:
Let's go through the provided code and see if it correctly implements the above logic.

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Check if Already Sorted**:
   - The code checks if the entire array is already sorted using `check_all`. If true, it prints "YES".
   
2. **Finding the Split Point**:
   - If the array is not sorted, the code iterates through the array to find the first point where `a[i-1] > a[i]`.
   - Once found, it considers the suffix starting from index `i` (`new = a[i:]`).
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - `check_all_new`: Whether the first element of the original array (`a[0]`) is greater than or equal to every element in the suffix.
     - `new_all`: Whether the suffix itself is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Multiple "NO" Outputs**: The current implementation might print "NO" multiple times if there are multiple points where `a[i-1] > a[i]`, which is incorrect.
- **Logic Flaw**: The condition `check_all_new` is not sufficient. It only checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to every element in the suffix, but it doesn't ensure that the entire prefix (before the split point) is greater than or equal to the suffix.
- **Single Check**: The program should only print "NO" once after checking all possible split points, not immediately after finding one invalid split point.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations.

**Correctness: False**

To fix the program, we would need to ensure that we check all possible split points and verify that the entire prefix is greater than or equal to the suffix, not just the first element of the prefix.
