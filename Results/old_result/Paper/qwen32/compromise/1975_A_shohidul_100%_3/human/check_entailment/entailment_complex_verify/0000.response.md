### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated version to determine its correctness.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if the entire array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`. If true, it prints "YES".
2. **Splitting and Checking**: If the array is not initially sorted, the program iterates through the array to find the first point where `a[i - 1] > a[i]`. At this point, it considers the suffix starting from index `i` (`new = a[i:]`) and checks two conditions:
   - `check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])`: This checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to every element in the suffix.
   - `new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])`: This checks if the suffix itself is sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. **Decision Making**: If both conditions are met, the program prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Single Split Point Check**: The program only checks the first point where `a[i - 1] > a[i]` and then breaks out of the loop. This means it doesn't consider other possible splits that might lead to a sorted array.
- **Incorrect Logic for Valid Split**: The logic for checking the validity of the split point is flawed. Specifically, the condition `a[0] >= new[i]` is too restrictive. It requires the first element of the original array to be greater than or equal to every element in the suffix, which is not necessary for the array to be sorted after swapping.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5
2 3 1 4 5
```

#### Expected Output:
```
Yes
```

#### Explanation:
The array `[2, 3, 1, 4, 5]` can be split into `[2, 3]` and `[1, 4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[1, 4, 5, 2, 3]`, which is still not sorted. However, another valid split is `[2, 3, 1]` and `[4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[4, 5, 2, 3, 1]`, which is still not sorted. Another valid split is `[2, 3, 1, 4]` and `[5]`.
