### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific type of operation: splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them. The logic in the program can be broken down as follows:

1. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])`. If true, it immediately prints 'YES' for that test case.

2. **Finding the Point of Disorder**: If the initial check fails, the program iterates through the array to find the first point where the array is not sorted (`a[i - 1] > a[i]`). At this point, it considers the possibility of making the array sorted by moving the prefix up to this point to the end of the array.

3. **Checking New Order**: When a disorder point is found, the program constructs a new array starting from the disorder point (`new = a[i:]`) and checks two conditions:
   - `check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])`: This ensures that the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to every element in the new array, which would mean that moving the prefix to the end would not disrupt the order.
   - `new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`: This ensures that the new array itself is sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. **Decision Making**: If both conditions are satisfied, the program prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop for that test case. If not, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.

### Issues in the Logic:

The current implementation has a logical flaw. Specifically, the program only checks the condition for the first point of disorder and does not consider other possible splits that might lead to a sorted array. For example, consider the array `[3, 1, 4, 2, 5]`. The first disorder point is between `3` and `1`, but moving the prefix `[3]` to the end does not sort the array. However, moving the prefix `[3, 1]` to the end results in the sorted array `[4, 2, 5, 3, 1]`, which can then be further manipulated to `[2, 5, 3, 1, 4]` and finally `[1, 4, 2, 5, 3]`, and eventually sorted by further operations.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider all possible splits and check if any of them can lead to a sorted array. The current implementation does not do this and thus may incorrectly output 'NO' for arrays that can be sorted with more complex splits.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified in the logic, the program is not always correct according to the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
