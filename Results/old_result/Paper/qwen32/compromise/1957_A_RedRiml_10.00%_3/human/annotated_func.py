#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.

    #State: The number of unique elements in the list `palka` from the last iteration that appear at least 3 times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers, and prints the number of unique integers in each list that appear at least three times.
