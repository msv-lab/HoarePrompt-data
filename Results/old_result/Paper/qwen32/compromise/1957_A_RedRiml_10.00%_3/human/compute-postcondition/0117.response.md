The code snippet `shapes += 1` increments the value of `shapes` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `shapes` was either 0 or 1 before the increment (depending on the condition involving the count of `j` in `d`), after the increment, `shapes` will be 1 or 2 respectively.

Output State: **`palka` is the original list of integers that must have at least one element, `w` is the length of `palka` minus 1, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least one element, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each element in `palka`, `ln` is the original input integer, `j` is the next element in `pl` after the current `j`, `shapes` is either 1 or 2.**
