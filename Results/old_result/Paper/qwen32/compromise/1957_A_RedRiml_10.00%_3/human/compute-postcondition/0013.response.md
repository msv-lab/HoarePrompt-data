The code snippet provided is `pl.append(i)`. This line appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`.

Given the initial state, `pl` is initially an empty list. After executing `pl.append(i)`, `pl` will contain one element, which is the value of `i`.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `d`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` must be greater than 0; `ln` is an integer read from the input; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `pl` is a list containing the integer `i`; `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, then `d` now contains the key `i` with the value 1. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1. Additionally, `i` is not in `pl` (before the append operation).**
