Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `palka` is a list of integers from the input, `w` is the length of `palka` minus 1, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the previous `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`, `ln` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one element, `w` is the length of `palka` minus 1, `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the element `i`, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is either `1` (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or incremented by `1` (if `i` was already in `d`), `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the previous `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`, `ln` is an input integer. If `i` was not in `pl` before the if statement, it is now added to `pl` and `d[i]` is updated accordingly.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one element, `w` is the length of `palka` minus 1, `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the element `i` but if `i` was not in `pl`, it is now added, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is either `1` (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or incremented by `1` (if `i` was already in `d`), `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the previous `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`, and `ln` is an input integer. If `i` was not in `pl`, `pl` now includes `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one element; `w` is the length of `palka` minus 1; `pl` is a list that contains the element `i` if it was not previously in `pl`; `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is `1` if `i` was not previously in `d` or incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`; `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka` (updated if necessary); `ln` is an input integer; `i` is the next element in `palka`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
