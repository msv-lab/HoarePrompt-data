The code snippet provided resets the list `pl` to an empty list. This action does not affect the values of `shapes`, `w`, `ln`, or `palka`. Therefore, the only change is that `pl` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`shapes` is the total number of unique elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`; `w` is incremented by 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `pl` is an empty list.**
