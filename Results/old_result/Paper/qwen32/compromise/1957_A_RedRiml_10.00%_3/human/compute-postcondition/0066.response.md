Postcondition: **`shapes` is the total number of unique elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d` (updated if `i`'s count became 3 or more); `w` is incremented by 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`. If `i` was not in `pl`, `pl` now includes `i` as its last element.**
