Postcondition: **`palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one element; `w` is the length of `palka` minus 1; `pl` is a list that contains the element `i` if it was not previously in `pl`; `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is `1` if `i` was not previously in `d` or incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`; `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka` (updated if necessary); `ln` is an input integer; `i` is the next element in `palka`.**
