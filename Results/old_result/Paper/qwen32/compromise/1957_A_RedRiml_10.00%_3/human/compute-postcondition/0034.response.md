The code snippet `shapes += 1` increments the value of the variable `shapes` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `shapes` is incremented. If `shapes` was initially 0, it will now be 1. If `shapes` was already 1 (because `d[j]` was greater than or equal to 3), it will now be 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` must be greater than 0; `ln` is an integer read from the input; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input that must contain at least one element; `pl` is a list containing each unique element from `palka` in the order they first appeared, and must contain at least one element; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `palka` and each value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` was 1 and is now 2; otherwise, `shapes` was 0 and is now 1; `j` is the next element in `pl`.**
