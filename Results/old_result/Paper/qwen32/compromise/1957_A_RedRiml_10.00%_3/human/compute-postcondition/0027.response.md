To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables `pl` and `d`.

Here's a summary of the loop's operations:
- For each element `i` in the list `palka`, the loop checks if `i` is already a key in the dictionary `d`.
  - If `i` is not in `d`, it adds `i` as a key with a value of 1.
  - If `i` is already in `d`, it increments the value associated with `i` by 1.
- The loop also checks if `i` is in the list `pl`.
  - If `i` is not in `pl`, it appends `i` to `pl`.

After all iterations, the following will be true:
- `pl` will contain each unique element from `palka` exactly once, in the order they first appeared.
- `d` will contain each unique element from `palka` as keys, with the corresponding values representing the number of times each element appears in `palka`.

Thus, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` must be greater than 0; `ln` is an integer read from the input; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input; `pl` is a list containing each unique element from `palka` in the order they first appeared; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `palka` and each value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`.**

In simpler terms, `pl` will be a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared, and `d` will be a dictionary counting how many times each element from `palka` appears.
