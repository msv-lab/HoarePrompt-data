The code snippet `d[i] = 1` sets the value of the key `i` in the dictionary `d` to `1`. This means that if `i` was not already in `d`, it will now be added with a value of `1`. If `i` was already in `d`, its value will be overwritten to `1`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `d`. The other variables (`palka`, `w`, `pl`, `shapes`, `ln`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one element, `w` is the length of `palka` minus 1, `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the element `i`, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is `1`, `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the previous `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`, `ln` is an input integer, `i` is the next element in `palka`.**
