Given the code snippet `d[i] += 1`, it indicates that the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` is being incremented by 1. Since `d.get(i)` is not None, it means that the key `i` already exists in the dictionary `d` with some integer value.

Therefore, the value of `d[i]` will increase by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` must be greater than 0; `ln` is an integer read from the input; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is a dictionary with `d[i]` incremented by 1.**
