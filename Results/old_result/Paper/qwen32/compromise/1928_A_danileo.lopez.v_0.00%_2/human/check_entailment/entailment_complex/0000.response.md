### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then reassembled into a different rectangle (considering rotations as the same rectangle).

The key observation here is that if either dimension \(a\) or \(b\) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles of integer dimensions, and these can be rearranged to form a different rectangle. Specifically:
- If \(a\) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles of dimensions \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\).
- If \(b\) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles of dimensions \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\).

In both cases, these smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the only way to cut the rectangle is into two rectangles of dimensions \(a \times 1\) or \(1 \times b\), which can only be rearranged into the same original rectangle (rotated).

Thus, the program's logic of checking if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even is correct. If either is even, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
