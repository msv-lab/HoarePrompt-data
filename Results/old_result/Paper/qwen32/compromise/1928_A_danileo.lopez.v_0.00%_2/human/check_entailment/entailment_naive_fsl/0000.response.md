Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly determines whether Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle by checking if either dimension (a or b) is even. If either dimension is even, it is possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, it is not possible to form a different rectangle.

The logic in the code is sound and handles all edge cases:
- If `a` is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles of dimensions `a/2 x b` and `a/2 x b`, which can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
- If `b` is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles of dimensions `a x b/2` and `a x b/2`, which can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, the only possible cuts result in two `1 x b` or `a x 1` rectangles, which cannot form a different rectangle when rearranged.

The provided examples in the problem statement are also correctly handled by the program, and there are no edge cases that the program fails to address. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
