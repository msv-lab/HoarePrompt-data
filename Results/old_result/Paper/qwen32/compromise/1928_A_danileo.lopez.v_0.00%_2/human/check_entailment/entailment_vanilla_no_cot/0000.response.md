Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given a × b rectangle based on the given problem description. The key insight is that if either dimension of the rectangle is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a different rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, he cannot form a different rectangle because the resulting pieces would be 1 × (odd), and they can only form the same rectangle when rearranged. The program checks this condition and prints "Yes" if either dimension is even, otherwise "No".
