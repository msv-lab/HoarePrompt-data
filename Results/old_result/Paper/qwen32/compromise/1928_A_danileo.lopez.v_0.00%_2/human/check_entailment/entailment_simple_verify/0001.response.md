### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution to ensure its correctness.

**Problem Analysis:**
- Bob starts with a rectangle of size `a x b`.
- He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
- The two resulting rectangles should be used to form a new rectangle that is different from the original rectangle.
- Two rectangles are considered the same if one can be obtained by rotating the other.

**Key Observations:**
- If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle. This is because:
  - If `a` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two `a/2 x b` rectangles. These two rectangles can be placed side by side to form a new rectangle of size `a x (b/2)`.
  - If `b` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two `a x b/2` rectangles. These two rectangles can be placed on top of each other to form a new rectangle of size `(a/2) x b`.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, then any cut will result in two rectangles of size `a x (b-1)/2` or `(a-1)/2 x b`, and these cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

**Program Analysis:**
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b`.
- It checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If so, it prints "Yes", indicating that another rectangle can be formed.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints "No".

**Annotated Code Evaluation:**
- The annotated code correctly describes the program's behavior. For each test case, it checks if either `a` or `b` is even and prints "Yes" or "No" accordingly.
- The annotations confirm that the program logic aligns with the key observations made in the problem analysis.

**Edge Cases:**
- The program handles edge cases such as `a = 1` and `b = 1` correctly by printing "No" since both dimensions are odd.
- It also handles cases where one dimension is 1 and the other is even, correctly printing "Yes".

**Conclusion:**
- The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly determines whether another rectangle can be formed based on the observations above.
- The program handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness: **True**
