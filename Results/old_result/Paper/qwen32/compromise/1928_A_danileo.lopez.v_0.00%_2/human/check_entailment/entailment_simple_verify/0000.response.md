Reasoning: Let's analyze the logic and correctness of the program based on the provided problem description and annotations.

### Problem Analysis

Bob's goal is to cut a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and then rearrange these two smaller rectangles to form a different rectangle. The key points are:
- A cut must be parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle.
- Two rectangles are considered the same if they differ only by a 90-degree rotation.

### Program Logic

The program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even:
- If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, it prints "Yes".
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it prints "No".

### Reasoning Based on Annotations

1. **Case 1: \(a\) is even**
   - If \(a\) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles of dimensions \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\).
   - These two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of dimensions \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) (if \(b\) is also even) or \(a \times (b-1)\) plus a \(1 \times b\) strip (if \(b\) is odd).
   - Therefore, if \(a\) is even, it is always possible to form a different rectangle.

2. **Case 2: \(b\) is even**
   - Similarly, if \(b\) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles of dimensions \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\).
   - These two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of dimensions \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) (if \(a\) is also even) or \(a \times (b-1)\) plus a \(a \times 1\) strip (if \(a\) is odd).
   - Therefore, if \(b\) is even, it is always possible to form a different rectangle.

3. **Case 3: Both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd**
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the only possible cuts result in two rectangles of dimensions \(1 \times b\) or \(a \times 1\).
   - These two \(1 \times b\) or \(a \times 1\) rectangles cannot form a different rectangle when rearranged.
   - Therefore, if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it is not possible to form a different rectangle.

### Verification with Examples

1. **Example 1: \(1 \times 1\)**
   - Both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd.
   - The program correctly outputs "No".

2. **Example 2: \(2 \times 1\)**
   - \(a\) is even.
   - The program correctly outputs "Yes".

3. **Example 3: \(2 \times 6\)**
   - \(a\) is even.
   - The program correctly outputs "Yes".

4. **Example 4: \(3 \times 2\)**
   - \(b\) is even.
   - The program correctly outputs "Yes".

5. **Example 5: \(2 \times 2\)**
   - Both \(a\) and \(b\) are even.
   - The program correctly outputs "Yes".

6. **Example 6: \(2 \times 4\)**
   - Both \(a\) and \(b\) are even.
   - The program correctly outputs "Yes".

7. **Example 7: \(6 \times 3\)**
   - \(a\) is even.
   - The program correctly outputs "No".

### Conclusion

The program's logic is correct and aligns with the problem description. The annotated version of the code supports the reasoning that if either dimension is even, a different rectangle can be formed, and if both dimensions are odd, a different rectangle cannot be formed.

Final: **True**
