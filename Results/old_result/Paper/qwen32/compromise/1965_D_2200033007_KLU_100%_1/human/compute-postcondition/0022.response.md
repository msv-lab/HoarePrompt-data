Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing the sums of certain subarrays of the palindrome array `a` and must contain at least one element; `n` is an integer representing the length of the palindrome array `a` such that 3 <= n <= 1000; `idx` is `(n - 1) // 2 - 2`; `x` is the next element in the list `odds`; `a[idx]` is `(x - prev) // 2`; `a[n - 1 - idx]` is `(x - prev) // 2`; all other elements of `a` remain as described in the initial state.**

In simple terms, the value of `a[n - 1 - idx]` has been updated to be equal to `(x - prev) // 2`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
