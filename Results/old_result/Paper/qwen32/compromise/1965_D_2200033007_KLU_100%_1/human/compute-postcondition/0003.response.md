To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```
while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
```

This means that for the loop to execute again, both of the following conditions must be true:
1. `len(smallList) > 0`
2. `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `bigList` is `[1, 2, 3]`
- `smallList` is `[]`

Let's evaluate these conditions:
1. `len(smallList) > 0`: This condition is false because `smallList` is an empty list (`[]`), so `len(smallList)` is `0`.
2. `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`: This condition cannot be evaluated directly because `smallList` is empty, and accessing `smallList[-1]` would result in an error.

Since `smallList` is empty, the first condition is already false, and thus the loop will not execute again with the current state.

To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that both conditions are true:
1. We need to ensure that `smallList` is not empty, i.e., `len(smallList) > 0`.
2. We need to ensure that the last element of `bigList` matches the last element of `smallList`.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:
- Make `smallList` non-empty and set its last element to match the last element of `bigList`.

One possible adjustment is:
- Set `smallList` to `[3]` (or any other list ending with `3`).

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`bigList` is `[1, 2, 3]` and `smallList` is `[3]`**
