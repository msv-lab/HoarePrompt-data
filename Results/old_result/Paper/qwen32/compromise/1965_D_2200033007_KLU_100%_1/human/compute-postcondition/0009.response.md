To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given outputs after the first three iterations.

The loop condition is `while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `smallList` is not empty and the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal. Each iteration removes the last element from both `bigList` and `smallList`.

From the provided outputs:
- After the first iteration, `bigList` is `[1, 2, 3]` and `smallList` is `[]`.
- After the second iteration, `bigList` is `[1, 2]` and `smallList` is `[]`.
- After the third iteration, `bigList` is `[1]` and `smallList` is `[]`.

Since `smallList` becomes empty after the third iteration, the loop terminates. Therefore, no further iterations occur.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **bigList is [1], smallList is [].**

In natural language, this means that after removing matching elements from the end of both lists, `bigList` contains only the element `1`, and `smallList` is empty.
