You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze each function and see if they collectively solve the problem as described.

### Function Analysis

1. **`func_1(a)`**: This function generates all possible subarray sums of an array `a`. It iterates through all possible starting points `i` and ending points `j` of subarrays, calculates their sums, and stores them in a list `cts`. Finally, it sorts the list of subarray sums and returns it. This function works correctly for generating and sorting subarray sums.

2. **`func_2(cts)`**: This function takes a sorted list of subarray sums (`cts`) and removes duplicates by maintaining a list `odds`. If a sum appears twice consecutively, it is removed (indicating that it is not the missing subarray sum). This function works correctly under the assumption that the input list `cts` is sorted and contains all subarray sums except one.

3. **`func_3(odds, n)`**: This function reconstructs the original array `a` from the list of unique subarray sums (`odds`). It initializes an array `a` of size `n` with zeros and fills it by calculating the differences between consecutive sums in `odds`. The differences are divided by 2 because the array is a palindrome, and the same value appears symmetrically on both sides. This function assumes that the list `odds` contains the correct unique subarray sums to reconstruct the array.

4. **`func_4(bigList, smallList)`**: This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing two lists: `bigList` (which contains all subarray sums including the missing one) and `smallList` (which contains all subarray sums except the missing one). It removes matching elements from the end of both lists until they no longer match, and then returns the last element of `bigList`, which is the missing subarray sum. However, this function is not used in the main logic of the program provided.

### Main Logic

The main logic of the program involves:
- Generating all subarray sums of a hypothetical array `a` using `func_1`.
- Identifying the unique subarray sums (excluding the missing one) using `func_2`.
- Reconstructing the array `a` from these unique subarray sums using `func_3`.

However, the program does not actually generate all subarray sums of a hypothetical array `a` to identify the missing subarray sum. Instead, it directly processes the given list of subarray sums (excluding one) to reconstruct the array. Here's how the program should work:

1. Sort the given list of subarray sums.
2. Use `func_2` to remove duplicate sums, leaving the unique sums.
3. Use `func_3` to reconstruct the array from these unique sums.

The key point is that the program assumes the given list of subarray sums (excluding one) is already sorted and contains all necessary information to reconstruct the array.

### Conclusion

Given the problem constraints and the provided functions, the program should work correctly if the input list of subarray sums is processed as intended. Since the problem guarantees that there is always at least one valid solution, and the program follows a logical approach to reconstruct the array, the program is correct.
