### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and see how it aligns with the problem statement and the provided execution summaries of the functions.

1. **Sorting Subarray Sums**: The subarray sums are sorted initially. This helps in identifying patterns and duplicates easily.

2. **Identifying Odd Occurrences**: `func_2` processes the sorted list to remove any sums that appear twice, leaving us with sums that appear an odd number of times. This is crucial because, in a palindrome, each subarray sum (except possibly one) should appear an even number of times due to symmetry.

3. **Determining the Missing Sum**:
   - If the length of the list of odd occurrences (`odds`) is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, the program considers the possibility that the missing sum could be related to the smallest even or odd value in `odds`. This is a heuristic approach to identify the missing sum.
   - Otherwise, it constructs a smaller array `b` from the odd occurrences and calculates its subarray sums. It then compares these sums with the input subarray sums to deduce the missing sum.

4. **Constructing the Palindrome Array**:
   - Once the missing sum is identified, it is added back to the list of odd occurrences and sorted again.
   - `func_3` constructs the palindrome array `a` using the differences between consecutive elements in the list of odd occurrences. This step ensures that the array is symmetric and meets the required subarray sums.

5. **Verification**:
   - The constructed array `a` is printed as the output for each test case.

### Verification Against the Problem Statement:

- **Palindrome Property**: The constructed array `a` is a palindrome, as ensured by `func_3`.
- **Subarray Sums**: The program correctly identifies the missing subarray sum and constructs the array such that all other subarray sums match the input.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the constraints and guarantees provided in the problem statement effectively.

**Correctness: True**
