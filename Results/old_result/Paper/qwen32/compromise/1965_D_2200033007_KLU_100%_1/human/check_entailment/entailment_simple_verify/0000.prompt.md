You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    500000000 1000000000 500000000 500000000 1000000000

Output

    1 2 1 
    7 2 2 7 
    3 5 5 3 
    6 4 4 6 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
- We need to recover a palindrome array `a` from the given sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays.
- The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (size of the array) and a list of `\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1` subarray sums.
- The output should be a palindrome array `a` that satisfies the conditions.

### Program Analysis

#### Function Breakdown

1. **func_1(a)**:
   - Generates all possible subarray sums of the array `a`.
   - Sorts these sums and returns them.

2. **func_2(cts)**:
   - Takes a sorted list of subarray sums (`cts`).
   - Removes duplicate sums, leaving only the sums that appear an odd number of times.
   - Returns the list of these unique sums.

3. **func_3(odds, n)**:
   - Constructs a palindrome array `a` of size `n` using the unique sums (`odds`).
   - Iterates through the unique sums and assigns values to the corresponding positions in the palindrome array.
   - Uses the property of palindromes to ensure symmetry.

4. **func_4(bigList, smallList)**:
   - Compares the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList`, removing them if they match.
   - Returns the last element of `bigList` after the comparison.

### Verification Steps

1. **Generating Subarray Sums**:
   - `func_1` generates all subarray sums and sorts them. This part seems correct as it covers all possible subarrays.

2. **Handling Unique Sums**:
   - `func_2` removes duplicate sums, which aligns with the problem statement since the missing sum will appear an odd number of times.

3. **Constructing the Palindrome**:
   - `func_3` constructs the palindrome array using the unique sums. It ensures symmetry by assigning values to both ends of the array simultaneously.
   - The logic seems sound, assuming the input guarantees a valid solution.

4. **Finding the Missing Sum**:
   - `func_4` finds the missing sum by comparing the last elements of two lists. However, this function is not used in the main logic flow provided, so it might be redundant or incorrectly placed.

### Potential Issues

- **Redundant Function**: `func_4` is not used in the main logic flow, which might indicate an error in the intended usage.
- **Edge Cases**: The program assumes that the input guarantees a valid solution, but it doesn't handle cases where the input might be malformed or invalid (though the problem states this won't happen).

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with the provided examples to see if it works correctly.

#### Test Case 1:
```
Input:
3
1 2 3 4 1

Expected Output:
1 2 1

Actual Output:
1 2 1
```
The program produces the correct output.

#### Test Case 2:
```
Input:
4
18 2 11 9 7 11 7 2 9

Expected Output:
7 2 2 7

Actual Output:
7 2 2 7
```
The program produces the correct output.

#### Test Case 3:
```
Input:
4
5 10 5 16 3 3 13 8 8

Expected Output:
3 5 5 3

Actual Output:
3 5 5 3
```
The program produces the correct output.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and testing, the program appears to correctly solve the problem for the provided examples. It handles the generation of subarray sums, identifies the unique sums, and constructs a valid palindrome array.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly generates subarray sums, identifies the unique sums, and constructs a valid palindrome array for the provided test cases. The logic seems sound, and no edge cases were found that would cause incorrect behavior.
