Let's analyze the given code step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to recover a palindrome array `a` of length `n` from the given sums of all but one of its subarrays. The subarray sums are provided in an arbitrary order, and we need to deduce the original palindrome array.

### Provided Code Explanation:
The code consists of four functions:
1. **func_1(a)**: Generates all subarray sums of the array `a` and returns them sorted.
2. **func_2(cts)**: Takes a list of subarray sums (`cts`) and removes pairs of identical sums, leaving only unique sums that appear an odd number of times.
3. **func_3(odds, n)**: Constructs the palindrome array `a` of length `n` using the list of unique sums (`odds`). It assumes that the differences between consecutive sums in `odds` correspond to the elements of the palindrome.
4. **func_4(bigList, smallList)**: Compares two lists (`bigList` and `smallList`) and removes common trailing elements, returning the last element of `bigList` after removals.

### Analysis:
- **func_1(a)**: This function correctly generates all subarray sums and sorts them. However, in our context, we don't need to generate these sums; instead, we have the sums already provided in the input.
- **func_2(cts)**: This function processes the list of subarray sums to remove pairs of identical sums, which is useful because the sums of subarrays that appear an even number of times will cancel out, leaving us with the sums of subarrays that appear an odd number of times. This is crucial for identifying the missing subarray sum.
- **func_3(odds, n)**: This function attempts to reconstruct the palindrome array `a` using the unique sums (`odds`). It assumes that the differences between consecutive sums in `odds` correspond to the elements of the palindrome. This is a reasonable approach, but it relies on the assumption that the input list of sums is complete except for one missing sum.
- **func_4(bigList, smallList)**: This function seems unnecessary for the problem at hand. It compares two lists and removes common trailing elements, which doesn't directly contribute to solving the problem of reconstructing the palindrome.

### Verification:
Given the problem constraints and the provided code, let's verify if the code correctly reconstructs the palindrome array:
- The code uses `func_2` to filter out sums that appear an even number of times, which is correct.
- The code then uses `func_3` to reconstruct the palindrome array from the remaining sums, assuming the differences between consecutive sums correspond to the elements of the palindrome. This is a valid approach under the problem's assumptions.

### Conclusion:
The code appears to correctly solve the problem by filtering out sums that appear an even number of times and reconstructing the palindrome array from the remaining sums. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
