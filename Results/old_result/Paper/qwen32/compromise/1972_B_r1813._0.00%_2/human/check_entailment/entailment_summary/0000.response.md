Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the number of facing-up coins. The core insight is that Alice wins if and only if the number of "U" coins is odd. This is because each operation flips two adjacent coins, and if the number of "U" coins is odd, the player who starts (Alice) can always force the game into a state where the opponent (Bob) faces an even number of "U" coins, eventually leading to Bob's loss. Conversely, if the number of "U" coins is even, Bob can always respond in such a way that Alice faces an even number of "U" coins on her turn, eventually leading to Alice's loss. The program accurately counts the number of "U" coins in each test case and determines the winner accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
