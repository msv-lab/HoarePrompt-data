The code `ans *= i` multiplies the current value of `ans` by the value of `i`. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially set to `i`. After the operation, `ans` will be `i * i`, or `i^2`.

Here is the updated state of the variables:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains the first integer from the input.
- `m` remains the second integer from the input.
- `arr` remains a new list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one integer.
- `s` remains a list of characters from the input string.
- `res` remains a list of `n` integers where each element is 0.
- `ans` is now `i * i`.
- `c` remains `n`.
- `l` remains `r + 1` (or vice versa).
- `r` remains `l - 1` (or vice versa).
- `i` remains the next element in `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where each element is 0, `ans` is `i * i`, `c` is `n`, `l` is `r + 1` (or vice versa), and `r` is `l - 1` (or vice versa), and `i` is the next element in `arr`.**
