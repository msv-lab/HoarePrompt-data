The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, but the values are not specified. After executing the code, `n` and `m` will hold the values read from the input, and all other variables will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first `n-1` elements are `1 % m` and the last element is 0, `ans` is 1, `c` is `n`, `l` is between 0 and `n-1` depending on the number of 'L' characters, and `r` is between 0 and `n-1` depending on the number of non-'L' characters.**
