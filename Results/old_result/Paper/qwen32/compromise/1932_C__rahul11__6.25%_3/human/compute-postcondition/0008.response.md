The given code snippet is `ans *= i`. This line multiplies the current value of `ans` by the value of `i`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state provided. Given the context, it seems like `i` should be defined in a loop or some prior part of the code, but since it's not provided, we cannot determine a specific value for `ans` after this operation. 

However, if we assume `i` is a variable that has been previously defined and is known, then `ans` would be updated to `ans * i`. Since `ans` is initially 1, if `i` were, for example, 5, then `ans` would become 5. But without a specific value for `i`, we can only express the change in terms of `i`.

Given the lack of a specific value for `i`, the most accurate output state we can provide is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is `ans * i`.**

In natural language, this means that the value of `ans` is now the product of its initial value (1) and the value of `i`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
