Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves determining the possible values of `k` such that a given position `n` and number `x` in the sequence match the described settling pattern. The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and the pattern itself consists of the sequence `1, 2, ..., k, k-1, ..., 2` and then repeats.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` (Vasya's position) and `x` (the number Vasya received).

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program checks if `(n + x) % 2 != 0`. If true, it prints `0` because the sum of the position and the number should be even for a valid `k`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to find divisors of `q` (which is `(y - 2) // 2` or `(n - x) // 2`) that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, it adds it to the list `M`.
   - It then iterates through all integers from `1` to `int(w // 1)` (which should be `int(w)`), checking if they are divisors of `q` and if they or their corresponding pair `q // i` are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

4. **Combining Results:**
   - The program calculates `L1` as the divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` that meet the criteria.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it also calculates divisors of `(n - x) // 2` and adds them to `L1`.
   - It removes duplicates by converting `L1` to a set and then back to a list.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `L1`, which represents the number of valid `k` values.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Divisor Calculation in `func_1`:**
   - The loop `for i in range(1, int(w // 1))` is incorrect. It should iterate up to `int(w) + 1` to include the square root itself if it is an integer.
   - The check `if w == w // 1` is not the correct way to check if `w` is an integer. Instead, use `if w.is_integer()`.

2. **Logic for Divisors:**
   - The program only considers the square root and its divisors, but it should consider all divisors of `q` that meet the criteria.

3. **Handling of `n >= 3 * x - 2`:**
   - The program correctly adds the divisors of `(n - x) // 2` if `n >= 3 * x - 2`, but it does not handle the edge cases properly.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly outputs the number of valid `k` values, but the logic to determine these values is flawed.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the program is not correct. The logic for finding divisors and handling the conditions is flawed, which can lead to incorrect results.

**Correctness: False**
