Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Function `func_1` is not defined before it is used**: The function `func_1` is called in the main loop, but its definition is given after its first usage. Although Python allows this, it's better practice to define functions before they are called, and in this case, the logic might be incorrect.

2. **Logic for calculating `k` values is incorrect**: The main logic for determining the possible values of `k` is flawed. The program attempts to find divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` but does not correctly account for the constraints of the problem.

3. **Handling of the conditions for `k` is incomplete**: The program does not correctly implement the conditions for `k` based on the problem description. Specifically, it should consider how the sequence of numbers wraps around and repeats every `2k - 2` positions.

4. **Edge cases are not handled properly**: The program does not handle all edge cases, such as when `x` is 1 or when `n` is very large.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_valid_k(n, x):
    count = 0
    for k in range(x + 1, n + 1):
        period = 2 * k - 2
        position_in_period = (n - 1) % period
        if position_in_period < k - 1 and position_in_period + 1 == x:
            count += 1
        elif position_in_period >= k - 1 and 2 * k - 2 - position_in_period == x:
            count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_k(n, x))
```

This corrected version iterates over possible values of `k` and checks if Vasya's position and number fit the described pattern for each `k`.
