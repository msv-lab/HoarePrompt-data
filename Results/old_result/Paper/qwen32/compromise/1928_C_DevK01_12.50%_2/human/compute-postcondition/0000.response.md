The code snippet initializes an empty list `M`. This does not affect the initial state of `q`, which remains a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. The only change is the introduction of the new variable `M` which is an empty list.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is an empty list.**
