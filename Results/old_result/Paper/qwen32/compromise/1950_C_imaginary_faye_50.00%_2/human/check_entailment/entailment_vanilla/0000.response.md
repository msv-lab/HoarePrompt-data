Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to convert a given time in 24-hour format to 12-hour format. However, there are several issues with the code that make it incorrect:

1. The function `func_1` is defined after it is called, which will lead to a `NameError` when the program is run.
2. The conversion logic for hours is incorrect. Specifically, the program incorrectly handles hours from 13 to 23. For these hours, it should subtract 12 from the hour and format the result with leading zero if necessary, but it does not do so correctly. For example, the hour "13" should be converted to "01" PM, but the program incorrectly outputs "1" PM.
3. The program does not handle the special case of "12:00 AM" correctly. The hour "00" should be converted to "12 AM", but the program outputs "12" AM, which is correct, but it does not handle the AM/PM indicator correctly for "12:00 AM".
4. The program does not handle the special case of "12:00 PM" correctly. The hour "12" should be converted to "12 PM", but the program outputs "12" PM, which is correct, but it does not handle the AM/PM indicator correctly for "12:00 PM".

To fix the program, we need to address these issues:

- Move the function definition before the function call.
- Correct the logic for converting hours from 13 to 23 to subtract 12 and format with leading zero if necessary.
- Ensure that the AM/PM indicator is correctly set for all edge cases.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = int(s[:2])
        m = s[2:]
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            period = 'AM'
        elif h < 12:
            period = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            period = 'PM'
        else:
            h -= 12
            period = 'PM'
        print(f"{h:02}:{m} {period}")

func_1()
```

Given these issues, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
