You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

    #State: The output state consists of `t` lines, each containing the result of the corresponding test case based on the provided conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two distinct non-negative integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m`, and then determines the output based on specific conditions related to the value of `k` and the values of `n` and `m`. The output for each test case is printed on a new line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

We are given two distinct non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \). We need to find the length of the longest common contiguous subsequence in two infinite sequences \( a \) and \( b \), where:

- \( a_n = n \oplus x \)
- \( b_n = n \oplus y \)

Here, \( \oplus \) denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

### Insight

The key insight is that the sequences \( a \) and \( b \) are generated by XORing each index \( n \) with \( x \) and \( y \) respectively. The longest common contiguous subsequence can be found by analyzing the differences between \( x \) and \( y \).

### Observations

1. **Difference Calculation**:
   - Let \( k = x \oplus y \). The value \( k \) represents the bitwise difference between \( x \) and \( y \).

2. **Longest Common Subsequence**:
   - If \( k \) is a power of 2 (i.e., \( k \) has exactly one bit set in its binary representation), then the longest common subsequence length is \( k \).
   - If \( k \) is not a power of 2, the longest common subsequence length is determined by the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \).

3. **Special Cases**:
   - If \( x = 0 \) and \( y \) is odd, the longest common subsequence length is 1.
   - If \( x = 0 \) and \( y \) is even, the longest common subsequence length is 2.

### Program Analysis

Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly implements the above logic:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \) (which should be \( x \) and \( y \)).

2. **Difference Calculation**:
   - The program calculates \( k = |n - m| \). This is incorrect because we should be using \( k = n \oplus m \) instead of \( |n - m| \).

3. **Power of 2 Check**:
   - The program checks if \( k \) is a power of 2 using the condition `k & k - 1 == 0`. This is correct.

4. **Special Cases**:
   - The program handles the special cases where \( n = 0 \) and \( m \) is odd or even. These conditions are correct.

5. **General Case**:
   - The program calculates the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \) and subtracts it from \( k \). However, this logic is incorrect because the length of the longest common subsequence should be the highest power of 2 itself, not the difference.

### Conclusion

The program contains a critical error in the calculation of \( k \) (it uses \( |n - m| \) instead of \( n \oplus m \)). This error makes the program incorrect for the general case.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
