The code snippet provided is `r -= 1`, which means the value of `r` is decreased by 1. Given that `r` was initially `n - 3`, after executing the code, `r` becomes `n - 4`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `le`, `l`, `st`, `end`, and `ans`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is an index such that `l < n - 1` and `a[l] != a[l + 1]`, `r` is `n - 4`, `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, `end` is 2, `ans` retains its original value.**
