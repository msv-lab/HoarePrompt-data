The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of the variable `r` by 1. Given the initial state, `r` is initially `n - 2`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 3`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers where `a[n - 1] == a[n - 2]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is `n - 3`; `r` is `n - 3`; `st` is the length of the sequence of consecutive equal elements from the start; `end` is 3**.
