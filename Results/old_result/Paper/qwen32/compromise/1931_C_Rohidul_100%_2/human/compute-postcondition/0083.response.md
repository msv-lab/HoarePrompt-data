The code snippet `end += 1` increments the value of `end` by 1. Given the initial state, `end` was initially set to 2. After executing the code, `end` becomes 3.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged:
- `t` is still an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is still an integer greater than 1.
- `a` is still the new list of integers read from the input with the last two elements being equal.
- `le` is still the length of the list `a`.
- `l` is still `k-1` where `k` is the length of the sequence of equal elements starting from `a[0]`.
- `r` is still `n - 4`.
- `st` is still `k`.
- `ans` is still calculated as `max(0, le - (st + end))` if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `le - max(st, end)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input with the last two elements being equal, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `k-1` where `k` is the length of the sequence of equal elements starting from `a[0]`, `r` is `n - 4`, `st` is `k`, `end` is 3, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))` if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `le - max(st, end)`**.
