To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and understand the values and conditions that define `ans`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not directly used in the calculation of `ans`, so we can ignore it for this task.
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than 1. This variable is also not directly used in the calculation of `ans`.
3. **`a`**: A list of integers read from the input.
4. **`le`**: The length of the list `a`, which is simply `len(a)`.
5. **`l`**: Defined as `k-1` where `k` is the length of the sequence of equal elements starting from `a[0]`. This means `l` is the index of the last element in the initial sequence of equal elements.
6. **`r`**: Set to the value of `l`. This variable is not used further in the calculation of `ans`.
7. **`st`**: Set to `k`, the length of the sequence of equal elements starting from `a[0]`.
8. **`end`**: The length of the sequence of equal elements from the end of the list `a`.
9. **`ans`**: Calculated based on the following conditions:
   - If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
To find the value of `ans`, we need to determine the values of `st` and `end` based on the list `a`.

- **`st`**: This is the length of the sequence of equal elements starting from `a[0]`. For example, if `a = [3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1]`, then `st` would be 3 because the sequence starting from `a[0]` is `[3, 3, 3]`.
- **`end`**: This is the length of the sequence of equal elements from the end of the list `a`. Continuing the example above, if `a = [3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1]`, then `end` would be 1 because the sequence from the end is `[1]`.
- **`le`**: This is the length of the list `a`, which is simply `len(a)`.

Given these, `ans` is calculated as follows:
- If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans = max(0, le - (st + end))`.
- Otherwise, `ans = le - max(st, end)`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's take an example list to illustrate the calculation:
- Suppose `a = [5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 5]`.
- Here, `le = 6`, `st = 3` (because the sequence starting from `a[0]` is `[5, 5, 5]`), and `end = 1` (because the sequence from the end is `[5]`).
- Since `a[0] == a[-1]` (both are 5), `ans = max(0, 6 - (3 + 1)) = max(0, 2) = 2`.

### General Case:
Without a specific list `a`, we can describe `ans` in terms of the properties of `a`:
- If the first and last elements of `a` are the same, `ans` is the maximum of 0 and the difference between the length of `a` and the sum of the lengths of the sequences at the start and end.
- If the first and last elements of `a` are different, `ans` is the difference between the length of `a` and the maximum of the lengths of the sequences at the start and end.

### Final Output:
Based on the above analysis, we can describe the output in a general form:

Output: **ans (where ans is calculated based on the conditions provided: if a[0] == a[-1], ans = max(0, le - (st + end)), otherwise ans = le - max(st, end))**
