Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, `end` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list until the first element that is not equal to its subsequent element. If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`. Otherwise, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`**

In this output state, the variables `l` and `r` have been updated to `0` and `n - 1` respectively. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions as described.
