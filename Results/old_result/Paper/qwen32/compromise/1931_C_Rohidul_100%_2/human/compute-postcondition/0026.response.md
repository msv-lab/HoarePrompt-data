The code snippet calculates the value of `ans` as the difference between the length of the list `a` (`le`) and the maximum of `st` (length of the sequence of consecutive equal elements from the start) and `end` (length of the sequence of consecutive equal elements from `l` to the end of the list).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is the index where the sequence of consecutive equal elements from the start ends or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `r` is `l`; `st` is the length of the sequence of consecutive equal elements from the start; `end` is the length of the sequence of consecutive equal elements from `l` to the end of the list; `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`.**
