Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers where the first and last elements are equal; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is the index where the sequence of consecutive equal elements from the start ends or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `r` is `l`; `st` is the length of the sequence of consecutive equal elements from the start; `end` is the length of the sequence of consecutive equal elements from `l` to the end of the list; `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`**
