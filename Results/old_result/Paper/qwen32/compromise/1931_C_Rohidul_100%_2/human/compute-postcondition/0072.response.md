Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers with at least three elements where `a[0] == a[1]` and `a[1] == a[2]`, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 2, `end` is 1, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))` if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
