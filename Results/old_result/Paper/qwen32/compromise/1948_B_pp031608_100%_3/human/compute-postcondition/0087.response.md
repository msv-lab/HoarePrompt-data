To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3 (this represents the number of test cases).
- `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50 (this represents the length of the list `a`).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list that may have been modified based on certain conditions described within the loop.
- `ans` is a boolean value (True or False) that depends on whether all `nums` lists formed during the loop are sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement uses a list indexing technique to select between 'NO' and 'YES' based on the value of `ans`.

- If `ans` is `False`, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` evaluates to `['NO', 'YES'][0]`, which is `'NO'`.
- If `ans` is `True`, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` evaluates to `['NO', 'YES'][1]`, which is `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement will be either `'NO'` or `'YES'` depending on the value of `ans`. Since the exact value of `ans` is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe it based on the logic used to determine its value.

Output: **'NO' if ans is False, 'YES' if ans is True**
