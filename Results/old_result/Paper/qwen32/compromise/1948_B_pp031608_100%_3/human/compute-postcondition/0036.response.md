The given code snippet creates a new list `nums` by converting the integer `arr[i - 1]` into its individual digits and then appending `arr[i]` to this list.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3
- `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99
- `m` is an integer such that m ≥ 2
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `ans` is True
- At index `i`, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`

The line of code:
```python
nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
```
will create a list `nums` by:
1. Converting `arr[i - 1]` to a string.
2. Splitting this string into individual characters.
3. Converting each character back to an integer.
4. Appending `arr[i]` to this list of digits.

Thus, `nums` will contain the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an integer such that m ≥ 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is True, and at index `i`, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]; nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**
