To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the given information and analyze the code snippet:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `ans` is either `True` or `False` based on whether a certain condition in the loop was violated.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement uses a list indexing technique to select between two strings, `'NO'` and `'YES'`, based on the value of `ans`.

- If `ans` is `False`, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` evaluates to `['NO', 'YES'][False]`, which is equivalent to `['NO', 'YES'][0]`, resulting in `'NO'`.
- If `ans` is `True`, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` evaluates to `['NO', 'YES'][True]`, which is equivalent to `['NO', 'YES'][1]`, resulting in `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement depends on the value of `ans`. Since `ans` is either `True` or `False`, the output will be either `'NO'` or `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **'NO' if ans is False, 'YES' if ans is True**
