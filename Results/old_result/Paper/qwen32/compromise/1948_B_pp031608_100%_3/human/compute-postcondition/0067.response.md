Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` is False, and at the current index `i`, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`. `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and `nums` is not sorted.**

In this output state, the only change is that the variable `ans` has been set to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
