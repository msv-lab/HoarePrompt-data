Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of `a[1]` followed by `a[2]`, `ans` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
