The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a new list called `arr`. This means that `arr` will now contain the integers from the input.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `m` remain unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `arr`, which is populated with the integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
