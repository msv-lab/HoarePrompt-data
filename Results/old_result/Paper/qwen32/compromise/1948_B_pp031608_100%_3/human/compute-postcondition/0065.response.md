The code snippet creates a new list `nums` by converting each digit of `arr[i - 1]` into an integer and adding these digits to a list, followed by appending `arr[i]` to this list.

Given the initial state, `arr[i - 1]` is an integer, and `arr[i]` is also an integer. The conversion of `arr[i - 1]` into a list of its digits and appending `arr[i]` results in `nums` being a list of these digits followed by `arr[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` is True, and at the current index `i`, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]; nums` is a list consisting of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**
