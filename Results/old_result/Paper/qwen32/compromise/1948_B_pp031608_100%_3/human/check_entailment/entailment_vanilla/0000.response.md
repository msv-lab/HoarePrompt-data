Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array elements `arr`.

2. **Logic to Check Sorted Order:**
   - The program iterates over the array from the end to the beginning.
   - If it finds an element `arr[i]` that is smaller than the previous element `arr[i-1]`, it attempts to split `arr[i-1]` into its digits and checks if the resulting list (digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`) can be sorted.
   - If the list cannot be sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without setting `ans` to `False`, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".

3. **Issues in the Logic:**
   - The logic assumes that splitting `arr[i-1]` and checking if the resulting list can be sorted is sufficient to determine if the entire array can be sorted.
   - However, this approach does not consider the possibility of further splits being necessary for other elements or the effect of those splits on the rest of the array.
   - For example, if `arr[i-1]` is split into multiple digits, those digits might need to be compared with elements before `arr[i-1]` in the array.
   - Additionally, the program only checks if the immediate sublist (digits of `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]`) can be sorted, but it doesn't ensure that the entire array can be sorted after these operations.

### Example to Illustrate the Issue

Consider the following test case:

```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

The program will correctly handle the first and third test cases. However, for the second test case `[12, 28, 5]`:

- When it reaches `i=2`, it finds `arr[2] < arr[1]` (5 < 28).
- It splits `arr[1]` into `[2, 8]` and checks if `[2, 8, 5]` can be sorted, which it can.
- However, this does not guarantee that the entire array can be sorted. The correct approach would involve more complex checks to ensure that all elements can be rearranged to form a sorted array.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the described operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
