The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the length of `nums` (which is determined by the length of the list `nums`). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. If `nums` has at least one element, the loop can execute.

Given the initial state, `N` is the number of test cases, `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers including `0`, and `ls` is `0`. The variable `N` does not affect the execution of the loop directly, as the loop iterates over `nums`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `nums` has at least one element for the loop to execute.

The initial state provided already includes that `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers, which implies it has at least one element (since it includes `0`). However, to be explicit and adhere to the requirement of adjusting the state for the loop to execute, we can state that `nums` must have at least one element.

State: **`N` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^4), `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least one element, `ls` is 0, `i` is 0**
