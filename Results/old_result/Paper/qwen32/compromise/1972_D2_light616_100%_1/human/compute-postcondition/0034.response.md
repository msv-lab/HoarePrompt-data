Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 4, `n` must be at least 10, `m` must be at least 15. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is 8. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 7.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged, including their preconditions.
