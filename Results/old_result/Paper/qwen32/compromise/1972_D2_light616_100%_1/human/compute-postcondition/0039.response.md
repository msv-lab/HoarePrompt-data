To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to analyze the conditions specified in the loop's header:

The `while` loop condition is:
```
(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m
```

Given the state right before the loop:
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 1
- `cnt` is 9
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 9

We need to ensure both parts of the condition are satisfied:
1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
2. `(x + y) * y <= m`

Let's evaluate each part:

1. For the first part `(x + y) * x <= n`:
   - Substitute the given values: `(3 + 1) * 3 <= n`
   - Simplify: `4 * 3 <= n` which means `12 <= n`
   - Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 9, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 12 to satisfy this condition.

2. For the second part `(x + y) * y <= m`:
   - Substitute the given values: `(3 + 1) * 1 <= m`
   - Simplify: `4 * 1 <= m` which means `4 <= m`
   - The state does not specify any constraints on `m`, so we need to add a constraint that `m` must be at least 4 to satisfy this condition.

No other variables (`x`, `y`, or `cnt`) need to be adjusted as they do not appear in the loop condition.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 1, `cnt` is 9, `n` must be greater than or equal to 12, `m` must be greater than or equal to 4**
