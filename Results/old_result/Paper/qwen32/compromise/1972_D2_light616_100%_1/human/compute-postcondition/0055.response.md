Given the initial state where `x` is 7, `y` is 1, and `cnt` is 19, we need to determine what will be printed by the `print(cnt)` statement.

The variable `cnt` is explicitly given a value of 19 in the initial state. Therefore, when the `print(cnt)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `cnt`.

Output: **19**
