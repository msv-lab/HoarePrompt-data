To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue as long as both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `m` must be at least 2.
- `x` is 1.
- `y` is 2.
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1.
- `cnt` is the smaller of `n // 2` and `m // 2`.

Let's check the conditions with the current values of `x` and `y`:
1. `(x + y) * x = (1 + 2) * 1 = 3`
2. `(x + y) * y = (1 + 2) * 2 = 6`

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be satisfied:
1. `3 <= n`
2. `6 <= m`

Since `n` must be at least 2 and `m` must be at least 2, we need to adjust these values to satisfy the conditions:
- `n` should be at least 3.
- `m` should be at least 6.

No other variables (`x` and `y`) need to be adjusted because the problem specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, and the loop head only involves `n` and `m`.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`n` must be at least 3, `m` must be at least 6, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1**.
