To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` given the initial state.

Given:
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 2
- `cnt` is 6 if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` is 1 (which is not the case here since GCD(2, 2) is 2)
- `n` must be at least 8
- `m` must be at least 8

Let's calculate the expression step-by-step:

1. Calculate `(x + y) * x`:
   \[
   (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8
   \]

2. Calculate `(x + y) * y`:
   \[
   (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8
   \]

3. Evaluate `n // ((x + y) * x)`:
   Since `n` is at least 8, the minimum value for `n` is 8. Thus,
   \[
   n // 8 \geq 8 // 8 = 1
   \]
   Let's denote this as `n // 8`.

4. Evaluate `m // ((x + y) * y)`:
   Similarly, since `m` is at least 8, the minimum value for `m` is 8. Thus,
   \[
   m // 8 \geq 8 // 8 = 1
   \]
   Let's denote this as `m // 8`.

5. Determine `min(n // 8, m // 8)`:
   Since both `n // 8` and `m // 8` are at least 1, the minimum value is 1.

6. Update `cnt`:
   \[
   cnt += 1
   \]
   Given the initial value of `cnt` is 6 (if the GCD condition were met, which it isn't, but we'll proceed with the given value):
   \[
   cnt = 6 + 1 = 7
   \]

Thus, the updated value of `cnt` is 7. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 2, `cnt` is 7, `n` must be at least 8, and `m` must be at least 8.**
