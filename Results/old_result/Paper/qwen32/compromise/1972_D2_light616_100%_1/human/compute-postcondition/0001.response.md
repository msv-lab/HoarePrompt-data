In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head contains only one variable `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable when its value is not used within the loop body.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to consider the value of `t`. Since `t` is given as an input integer representing the number of test cases and it is constrained by `1 <= t <= 10^4`, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `t`:** This variable determines how many times the loop will iterate. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be at least 1. Given the constraints, this condition is already satisfied as `t` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.

2. **Variable `_`:** This is a throwaway variable in Python, typically used when the loop variable is not needed. We do not need to adjust its state since it is automatically assigned values from the range during each iteration.

Since the only variable in the loop head is `_` and its value is determined by the range function, the only state we need to ensure is that `t` is at least 1, which is already guaranteed by the problem constraints.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
