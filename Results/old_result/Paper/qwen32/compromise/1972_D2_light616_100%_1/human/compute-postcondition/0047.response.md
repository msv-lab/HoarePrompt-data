Output State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 3, `n` is at least 15, `m` is at least 10, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, and `cnt` is 11.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged, including the condition that the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, which still holds true since the GCD of 3 and 3 is not 1, but the problem specifies the initial GCD condition before the increment, and no other changes affect this condition directly.
