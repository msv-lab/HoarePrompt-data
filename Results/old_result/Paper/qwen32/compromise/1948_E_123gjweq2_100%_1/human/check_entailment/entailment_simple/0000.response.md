### Reasoning:

The provided program is incorrect based on the problem description and the expected output. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Initialization and Use of Arrays:**
   - The `arr` array is supposed to hold the distinct integers assigned to the vertices. However, the array is initialized with zeros and never properly set to contain distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
   - Similarly, the `cliquess` array is initialized with zeros and never updated correctly to reflect the clique assignments.

2. **Function `make_array`:**
   - The function `make_array` is intended to fill segments of the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays. However, the indices used to fill these arrays are incorrect and don't ensure that `arr` contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
   - The `cliquess` array is supposed to indicate which clique each vertex belongs to. However, the function incorrectly assigns values to `cliquess` based on the wrong indices.

3. **Output:**
   - The first line of the output is supposed to print the distinct integers assigned to the vertices. Instead, it prints the uninitialized `arr` array, which contains zeros.
   - The third line of the output is supposed to print the clique assignments for each vertex. Instead, it prints the uninitialized `cliquess` array, which contains zeros.

### Correctness:
Given the issues outlined above, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
