You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Global Variables**: The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess`. This is not a good practice and can lead to bugs if the functions are called multiple times. Instead, these variables should be passed as parameters or returned from the functions.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `cliques`**: The number of cliques is calculated using `ceil(n / k)`, which is not necessarily the minimum number of cliques required. The problem requires the minimum number of cliques, and this calculation does not guarantee that.

3. **Incorrect Array Initialization**: The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized with zeros, but they are supposed to contain distinct integers from 1 to `n` and clique identifiers, respectively. The function `make_array` does not properly initialize these arrays.

4. **Incorrect Logic in `make_array`**: The logic in `make_array` does not ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is satisfied for all pairs of vertices within the same clique. The function simply assigns values to the array in a specific pattern without checking the condition.

5. **Incorrect Output**: The function `func_1` prints the results directly, which is not suitable for handling multiple test cases. The results should be collected and printed after processing all test cases.

Let's consider a specific example to demonstrate the incorrectness:

For the input:
```
1
5 4
```

The program might output something like:
```
0 0 0 0 0
2
0 0 0 0 0
```

This output is clearly incorrect because:
- The values in `arr` should be distinct integers from 1 to 5.
- The number of cliques should be the minimum required, and the partition should satisfy the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.

A correct output for this input could be:
```
1 2 3 4 5
1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Or another valid output could be:
```
5 4 3 2 1
1
1 1 1 1 1
```

However, the provided program does not guarantee such a correct output for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
