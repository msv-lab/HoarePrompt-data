### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program code, using the function summary and the original assessment to determine the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Recap:
1. **Split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays `b1, b2, ..., bk` such that their concatenation equals the original array `a`.**
2. **Calculate the penalty for each subarray `bi` as `|sum(bi)| * len(bi)`.**
3. **Find the minimum possible total penalty.**

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
- Splitting the string `s` based on the character `'-'`.
- Using a function `func_1` to calculate the number of times the cumulative balance of `'+'` and `'-'` goes negative, plus one if the balance is positive at the end.

#### Function Summary:
The function `func_1`:
- Evaluates a string `expression` consisting of `'+'` and `'-'` characters.
- Returns the number of times the cumulative balance of `'+'` and `'-'` went negative during the evaluation, plus one if the balance is positive at the end.

#### Issues with the Provided Program:
1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**:
   - The program splits the string `s` by `'-'`, which does not ensure that the sum of the subarrays is minimized. The optimal split depends on the balance between `'+'` and `'-'` characters, not just the occurrence of `'-'`.
   
2. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the penalty incorrectly. It only counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end. This does not reflect the actual penalty calculation as described in the problem statement.
   
3. **Lack of Optimal Splitting Strategy**:
   - The program does not implement an optimal strategy to split the string to minimize the total penalty. It should consider all possible splits and calculate the penalties accordingly.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
1
10
--+++++++-
```
The optimal split would be:
- `b1 = [-1, -1]` with penalty `|sum(b1)| * len(b1) = 2 * 2 = 4`
- `b2 = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` with penalty `|sum(b2)| * len(b2) = 7 * 0 = 0`
- `b3 = [-1]` with penalty `|sum(b3)| * len(b3) = 1 * 1 = 1`
- `b4 = [1, 1]` with penalty `|sum(b4)| * len(b4) = 2 * 0 = 0`

The total penalty would be `4 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 5`.

However, the provided program does not yield this result. Instead, it seems to be counting the number of times the balance goes negative and adding 1 if the balance is positive at the end, which is not the correct approach for calculating the minimum penalty.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not implement an optimal strategy for splitting the string and calculating the penalties. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
