### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the minimum penalty for splitting the string `s` into non-empty arrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The function `func_1` seems to be trying to determine the number of times the cumulative sum (balance) of the string goes negative and adds one if the balance is positive at the end. However, this approach does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty as described in the problem statement.

The function `func_1` does not consider the actual penalty calculation, which involves taking the absolute value of the sum of each subarray and multiplying it by the length of that subarray. Instead, it simply counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds one if the balance is positive at the end, which does not align with the penalty calculation logic.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find an optimal way to split the array such that the sum of penalties for all subarrays is minimized. This requires a more sophisticated algorithm, possibly dynamic programming or a greedy approach, to consider the actual penalties incurred by different splits.

Given the current implementation of `func_1`, it does not provide the correct solution for the problem as described.
