Let's analyze the provided code and the problem description step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to split the array `a` derived from the string `s` into subarrays in such a way that the sum of penalties is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

### Provided Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case:
1. It reads the length of the string `s`.
2. It reads the string `s`.
3. It splits the string `s` by the character `'-'` and calculates the sum of the lengths of the resulting parts. This step seems unrelated to the optimal splitting strategy.
4. It calls `func_1` with the original string `s` and the calculated `result_length`.
5. The function `func_1` calculates a count by iterating through the string and adjusting a balance counter based on whether the character is `'+'` or `'-'`. If the balance becomes negative, it increments a count and resets the balance. Finally, it returns the count plus one if the balance is positive.

### Issues in the Provided Program
1. **Incorrect Splitting Strategy**: The program splits the string `s` by the character `'-'` and calculates the sum of the lengths of the resulting parts. This does not help in finding the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.
2. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**: The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty. It simply counts the number of times the balance becomes negative and adds one if the balance is positive at the end. This logic does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

### Correct Approach
To solve this problem optimally, we need to find a way to split the array such that the sum of penalties is minimized. One approach is to use dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to find the optimal splits. However, the provided code does not implement such an approach.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It uses an incorrect strategy for splitting the array and calculating the penalty.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
