Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers; `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` is [sum of the last segment, end index of the last segment]; `segments_variants` is a list of all considered segments including `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `[len(arr) - 1]`; `max_sum` is -1; `total_max_segment` is the segment with the maximum sum from `segments_variants`. The length of `total_max_segment` is 1.**
