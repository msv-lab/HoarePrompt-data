### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided code and suggests an appropriate solution. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Incomplete Implementation**:
   - The provided code does not perform any operations to insert the sum of any subarray into the array. Instead, it only identifies the maximum subarray sum. This is insufficient to solve the problem as described, which requires performing exactly `k` operations to maximize the array's sum.

2. **Inadequate Handling of Operations**:
   - The code does not handle the `k` operations as described. It does not repeatedly insert the sum of a subarray back into the array to maximize the total sum. This is a fundamental flaw in the logic.

3. **Lack of Modulo Operation**:
   - While the code includes a function `func_1` to take a number modulo \(10^9 + 7\), it does not use this function anywhere in the code to ensure that the final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is necessary to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

4. **Incomplete Functionality**:
   - The function `func_3` is defined but not implemented, and it does not seem to be used in the code. This function seems to be intended for some purpose but is not functional.

5. **Correct Solution**:
   - The original assessment provides a sketch of the correct implementation. This implementation correctly identifies the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm, performs `k` operations to maximize the total sum by repeatedly adding the maximum subarray sum to the current sum, and ensures all operations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Final Evaluation:

Given the analysis above, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. It is incomplete and does not handle the required operations to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.

**Final: False**
