Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `a1` and `a2` remain the same, `l2` and `l22` are updated based on the last iteration's conditions, `idx1` and `idx2` are updated based on the last iteration's conditions, `p1` and `p2` remain the same, `val` contains at least one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `l` is updated based on the last iteration's conditions, and `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `l2`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `l` remain as they were before the `break` statement, except that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
