Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine what will be printed.

The provided code snippet is:
```python
print('yes')
```

This `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'yes'`.

Here's the detailed breakdown:
- The initial state describes various variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `l`, `_`), but none of these variables are involved in the `print` statement.
- The `print('yes')` statement is a direct output of the string `'yes'`, irrespective of the values of the variables defined in the initial state.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **yes**
