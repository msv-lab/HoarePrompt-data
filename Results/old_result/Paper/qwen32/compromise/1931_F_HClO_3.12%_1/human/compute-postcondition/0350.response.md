The code snippet `val.append((a3, l3))` appends a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. The variables `a3` and `l3` are not changed by this operation, but `val` now includes this new tuple as its last element.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `a1` and `a2` remain the same, `l2` is updated based on conditions, `l22` is updated based on conditions, `idx1` is updated based on conditions, `idx2` is updated based on conditions, `p1` and `p2` remain the same, `val` contains an additional tuple `(a3, l3)`, `l` is updated based on conditions, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input.**

In simpler terms: The variable `val` now includes an additional tuple `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is the first integer from the input and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input. All other variables remain unchanged or retain their previously defined update conditions.
