Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the first input line, `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`, `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`, `i` is 0, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, `val` is a list containing tuples `(a3, l3)` for each of the `m-2` iterations, `a3` is the first integer from the input of each iteration, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input of each iteration, `l` is a list equal to `l1` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2` with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3` or `a2` is not in `l3` or `a1` is not in `l3`, `_` is 1 if `l11 == l22`, otherwise `_` is `m-2`, the loop has not printed 'yes' or 'no' yet, if `m` is 1, the state remains the same as described above, if `m` is not 1 and `l11 != l22`, `m-3` additional input lines have been consumed. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Additionally, `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` if `p1` is 1, otherwise `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`. Both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to 0.**
