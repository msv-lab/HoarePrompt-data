Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1` with `a1` inserted at `idx2`; `l11` is a list of integers from the new `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; `i` is `n-1`; `idx1` and `idx2` are set based on the last iteration if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`; `p1` and `p2` are set based on the last iteration if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`; `val` is an empty list; `l` is a list equal to `l1`; `_` is 1 if `l11 == l22`, otherwise `_` is `m-2`; `idx1` is greater than `idx2`; the loop has not printed 'yes' or 'no' yet`**

In natural language: The variable `l` is now explicitly set to the value of `l1`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
