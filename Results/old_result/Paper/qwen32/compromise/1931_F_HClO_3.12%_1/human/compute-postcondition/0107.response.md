The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to `l3`. The initial state mentions that `_` is incremented by 1, but this variable is not used or affected by the code snippet. Therefore, we focus on the changes to `a3` and `l3`.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1; `a3` is the first integer from the input; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input.**

In simpler terms, after running the code, `_` remains incremented by 1, `a3` holds the first integer from the input, and `l3` is a list containing the rest of the integers from the input.
