The code assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` are integers provided by the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with all occurrences of `a2` removed to form `l11`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` with all occurrences of `a1` removed, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0. Additionally, `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
