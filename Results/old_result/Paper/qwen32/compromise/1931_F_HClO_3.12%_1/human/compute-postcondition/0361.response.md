The only objects in the loop head are the variables `a3` and `l3`. Therefore, we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `val` list, which contains tuples `(a3, l3)`. If there are more tuples in `val`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `val` contains at least one more tuple `(a3_new, l3_new)`. This means that `a3` and `l3` should be updated to the next tuple in `val` for the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `a1` and `a2` remain the same, `l2` and `l22` are updated based on the last iteration's conditions, `idx1` and `idx2` are updated based on the last iteration's conditions, `p1` and `p2` remain the same, `val` contains at least one more tuple `(a3_new, l3_new)`, `l` is updated based on the last iteration's conditions, `a3` is `a3_new`, `l3` is `l3_new`**
