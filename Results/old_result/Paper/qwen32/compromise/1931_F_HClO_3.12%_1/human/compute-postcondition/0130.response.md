The provided code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into an integer `a1` and a list of integers `l1`. The initial state includes several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `l2`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `l`, `_`), but only `a1` and `l1` are affected by this code snippet. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer read from the input; `m` is an integer read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`, with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3` or `a2` is not in `l3` or `a1` is not in `l3` or `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l2` remains unchanged; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; `i` is `n-2` or the index where the loop broke early; `idx1` and `idx2` are the indices where `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1` or `-1` if no such pair is found; `p1` and `p2` are `1` if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1` was encountered, otherwise `0`; `val` is a list containing tuples `(a3, l3)` for each of the `m-2` iterations; `a3` is the first integer from the input of each iteration; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input of each iteration; `l` is a list equal to `l1` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2` with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3` or `a2` is not in `l3` or `a1` is not in `l3`; `_` is 1; the loop has not printed 'yes' or 'no' yet. If `m` is 1, the state remains the same as described above. If `m` is not 1, there is no else part to modify the state.**
