The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a value such that `i < n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given this, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; `i` is incremented by 1**
