Output State: **the loop has either printed 'yes' or 'no' and all iterations of the loop have finished.**

### Description:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the final state will be that the loop has either printed 'yes' or 'no'. The loop iterates over the list `val` containing tuples `(a3, l3)`. For each tuple, it checks if `l3` is equal to the list `l` with all instances of `a3` removed. If at any point `l3` is not equal to the modified `l`, it prints 'no' and breaks out of the loop. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it prints 'yes'. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `_`, and `a3` and `l3` for the last iteration remain as per the last executed iteration of the loop. The critical change is that the loop terminates and prints either 'yes' or 'no'.
