The code snippet provided assigns the value `1` to the variable `p2`. No other variables are modified in the provided code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; `i` is incremented by 1; `idx2` is equal to the value of `i`; If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; `p2` is 1.**
