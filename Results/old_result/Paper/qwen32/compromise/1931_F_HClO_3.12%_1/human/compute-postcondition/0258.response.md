The `input()` function is called, which reads a new line of input from the user. However, the value of this input is not assigned to any variable, so it does not affect the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, or `l22`. Therefore, none of these variables change in value.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where `m` must be at least 3, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with all occurrences of `a2` removed to form `l11`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` with all occurrences of `a1` removed.**
