You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5. Each of the k lines following the description of each test case contains n distinct integers a_{ij} each (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n), where a_{i0} is the author of the screenshot and is always at the top of the list. All authors of the screenshots are different.

    #State: t is 0, n and m remain unchanged, a1 and a2 remain the same, l2 and l22 are updated based on the last iteration's conditions, idx1 and idx2 are updated based on the last iteration's conditions, p1 and p2 remain the same, val contains m - 2 tuples (a3, l3) from the input, l is updated based on the last iteration's conditions. The loop has printed 'yes' or 'no' for all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the total number of screenshots and `k` is the number of screenshots for which the author is specified. Following these, for each of the `k` test cases, it accepts a list of `n` distinct integers `a_{ij}` where `a_{i0}` is the author of the screenshot. The function returns a value indicating the author of each screenshot for all `t` test cases.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
