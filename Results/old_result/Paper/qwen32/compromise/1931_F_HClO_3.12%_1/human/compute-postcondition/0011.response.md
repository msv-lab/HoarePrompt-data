The code snippet provided creates a new list `l22` by filtering out any instances of `a1` from the list `l2`. 

Given the initial state, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `a1` is the first integer from the first input line.
- `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`.
- `a2` is the first integer from the new input line.
- `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`.
- `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`.

The code modifies the state by creating `l22`:
- `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`.**
