Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. The current value of `m` is 1.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables; it only affects the flow of the loop by skipping the rest of the current iteration and moving to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to the variables `t`, `n`, or `m`, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
