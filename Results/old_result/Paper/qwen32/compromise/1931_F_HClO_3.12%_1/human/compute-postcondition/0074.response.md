To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how the variables change with each iteration. The loop runs up to `n-1` times, but it can break early under certain conditions.

### Key Points:
- The loop iterates `i` from `0` to `n-2`.
- The loop breaks if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` or if `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1`.
- `idx1` and `idx2` are updated based on whether `l1[i + p1]` or `l2[i + p2]` matches `a2` or `a1`, respectively.
- `p1` and `p2` are set to `1` when `l1[i + p1]` or `l2[i + p2]` matches `a2` or `a1`, respectively.
- The loop breaks if both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative.

### Final Output State Analysis:
1. **Loop Completion**: The loop will run until `i` reaches `n-2` unless it breaks early.
2. **Variable Values**:
   - `i` will be `n-2` if the loop completes without breaking early.
   - `idx1` and `idx2` will be set to the index `i` if `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1` is encountered.
   - `p1` and `p2` will be `1` if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`, respectively, and will remain `0` otherwise unless set to `1` in a previous iteration.
   - The loop breaks if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, meaning the loop will not proceed to the next iteration if this condition is met.

### Output State:
- **`i`**: The loop will run until `i` is `n-2` unless it breaks early.
- **`idx1` and `idx2`**: These will be set to the index `i` where `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1` is found, or they will remain `-1` if no such pair is found.
- **`p1` and `p2`**: These will be `1` if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1` was encountered in any iteration, otherwise `0`.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; `i` is `n-2` or the index where the loop broke early; `idx1` and `idx2` are the indices where `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1` or `-1` if no such pair is found; `p1` and `p2` are `1` if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1` was encountered, otherwise `0`.**

In simpler terms, the loop will run until it either finds a matching pair of `a2` in `l1` and `a1` in `l2` or reaches the end of the possible iterations. The variables `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` will reflect the state of this search.
