Let's analyze the given initial state and the `print` statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than or equal to 2.
3. **`m`**: An integer read from the input, possibly decreased by 1 if `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.
4. **`a1`**: The first integer from the first input line.
5. **`l1`**: A list of integers from the first input line following `a1`, with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` under certain conditions.
6. **`a2`**: The first integer from the new input line.
7. **`l2`**: A list of integers from the new input line following `a2`, with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` under certain conditions.
8. **`l11`**: A list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`.
9. **`l22`**: A list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`.
10. **`i`**: The value `n-2` or the index where the loop broke early.
11. **`idx1` and `idx2`**: Indices where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or `-1` if no such pair is found.
12. **`p1` and `p2`**: `1` if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1` was encountered, otherwise `0`.
13. **`val`**: A list containing at least two tuples `(a3, l3)`.
14. **`a3`**: The first integer from the next tuple in `val`.
15. **`l3`**: The list of remaining integers from the next tuple in `val`.
16. **`l`**: A list equal to `l1` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise, it is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2` with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` under certain conditions.
17. **`_`**: Equal to `m - 2` indicating all iterations have completed.
18. **Loop Condition**: If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all instances of `a3` removed, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Analysis of the `print` Statement:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print('no')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'no'`. The value `'no'` is explicitly given and does not depend on any of the variables or their values described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
