Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` are integers provided by the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with all occurrences of `a2` removed to form `l11`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` with all occurrences of `a1` removed, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`. If `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.**
