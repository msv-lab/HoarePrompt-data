Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` are integers provided by the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with all occurrences of `a2` removed to form `l11`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` with all occurrences of `a1` removed, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`. The current value of `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0, and the current value of `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then `idx1` is set to `i`, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is set to 1, `p2` is set to 0. Otherwise, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is set to `i`, `p1` is set to 0, `p2` is set to 1. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In simpler terms, the execution of the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged except that the loop or if statement is exited.
