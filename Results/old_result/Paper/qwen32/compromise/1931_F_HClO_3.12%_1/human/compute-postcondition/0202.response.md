The code snippet provided inserts `a1` into `l1` at the position `idx2`. This will change the list `l1` and potentially affect `l11` as well, since `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`.

Given the initial state, the list `l1` will now have `a1` inserted at `idx2`, which means the new `l1` will have an additional element, and `l11` will need to be recalculated to exclude any instances of `a2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1` with `a1` inserted at `idx2`; `l11` is a list of integers from the new `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; `i` is `n-1`; `idx1` and `idx2` are set based on the last iteration if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`; `p1` and `p2` are set based on the last iteration if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`; `val` is an empty list; `l` is a list equal to `l1` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2` with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3` or `a2` is not in `l3` or `a1` is not in `l3`; `_` is 1 if `l11 == l22`, otherwise `_` is `m-2`; `idx1` is greater than `idx2`; the loop has not printed 'yes' or 'no' yet`**

In simpler terms: The list `l1` has `a1` inserted at `idx2`, and `l11` is recalculated to exclude any instances of `a2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
