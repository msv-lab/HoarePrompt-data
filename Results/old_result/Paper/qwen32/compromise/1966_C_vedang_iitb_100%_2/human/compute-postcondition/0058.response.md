To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over each element in the list `a` using the variable `sz`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the new input integer
- `a` is the sorted list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 1 element
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`
- `tc` is the value of `tc` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1
- `sz` is the next element in the list `a`. If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is incremented by 1.

The loop statement is:
```python
for sz in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the loop statement, we know that `sz` will take the next value from the list `a` in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `sz` should be the next element in the list `a` after the current `sz`.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:
- The variable `sz` will be updated to the next element in the list `a`.
- Other variables like `t`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, and `tc` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Assuming that the current `sz` was the `k`-th element in the list `a`, the next `sz` will be the `(k+1)`-th element in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `tc` is the value of `tc` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `sz` is the next element in the list `a` (the element following the current `sz`)**

Since we don't have the exact position of `sz` in the list `a`, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `tc` is the value of `tc` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `sz` is the next element in the list `a`**
