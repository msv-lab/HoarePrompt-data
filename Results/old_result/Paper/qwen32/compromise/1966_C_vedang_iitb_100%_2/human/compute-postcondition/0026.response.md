The code snippet updates the value of `maxsize` to be the maximum value in the list `a`. Since `a` is already given as a sorted list of integers, the maximum value in `a` is simply the last element of the list.

Given the initial state, `maxsize` was previously defined as the maximum value in the list `a`. After executing the line `maxsize = max(a)`, `maxsize` retains its correct value, which is the largest integer in the list `a`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `mexsize`, and `tc`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`; `tc` is `tc + 1`.**
