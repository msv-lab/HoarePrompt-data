To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, let's break down the problem step-by-step based on the initial state:

1. **Variables and Their Definitions:**
   - `t`: An input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
   - `n`: Another input integer.
   - `a`: A sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `maxsize`: The maximum value in the list `a`.
   - `mexsize`: The smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. It is also mentioned that `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.

2. **Logic of the Code:**
   - The code checks if `mexsize` is odd (`mexsize % 2 == 1`). If it is, it prints 'Alice'. Otherwise, it prints 'Bob'.

3. **Determining `mexsize`:**
   - Since `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`, it could be any integer starting from 1 upwards, but it must not be present in `a`.
   - Given that `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`, `mexsize` could be any integer from 1 to `maxsize` that is missing from `a`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The output depends on whether `mexsize` is odd or even.
   - If `mexsize` is odd, the output will be 'Alice'.
   - If `mexsize` is even, the output will be 'Bob'.

Since the exact value of `mexsize` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of `mexsize`.

Output: **Alice if `mexsize` is odd, otherwise Bob (where `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`)**
