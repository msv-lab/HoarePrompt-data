To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which is `sz` in this case. The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.

Here's the given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4;
- `n` is the new input integer;
- `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element;
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`;
- `tc` is `tc + 1`. If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is 2; otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1.

The loop statement is:
```python
for sz in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```

In the previous iteration, `sz` took on the value of the current element in the list `a`. To proceed to the next iteration, `sz` should take on the value of the next element in the list `a`.

Since we don't know the specific values of `a` or the exact position of `sz` in the list `a` at the end of the previous iteration, we can assume that `sz` was the `k`-th element in the list `a` during the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `sz` should be the `(k+1)`-th element in the list `a`.

However, since we don't have the specific index, we can simply denote the next value of `sz` as the next element in the list `a` without specifying its exact value.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `tc` is `tc + 1`. `sz` is the next element in the list `a`. If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is 2; otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1.**

Since the exact value of `sz` cannot be determined without knowing the specific elements of `a`, we leave it as "the next element in the list `a`".
