The code snippet assigns a new value to `n` by reading an integer from the input. This does not affect the values of `t`, `a`, `maxsize`, `mexsize`, or `tc`. The only change is that `n` now holds the value of the new input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`; `tc` is the value of `tc` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.**
