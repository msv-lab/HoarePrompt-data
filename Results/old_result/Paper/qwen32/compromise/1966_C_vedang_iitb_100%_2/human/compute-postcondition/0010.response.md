Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If `sz` equals `mexsize` (which is initially 1), then `mexsize` is updated to 2.**
