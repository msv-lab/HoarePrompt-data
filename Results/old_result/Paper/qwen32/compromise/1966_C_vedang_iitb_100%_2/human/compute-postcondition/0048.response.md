The code updates the value of `maxsize` to be the maximum value in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is the new sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the previous list `a`; `tc` is the value of `tc` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.**
