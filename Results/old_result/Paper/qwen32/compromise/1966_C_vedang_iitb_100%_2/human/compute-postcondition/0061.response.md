To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the variables change with each iteration of the loop. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t`: An input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 (remains unchanged throughout the loop).
   - `n`: The new input integer (remains unchanged throughout the loop).
   - `a`: A sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `maxsize`: The maximum value in the list `a` (remains unchanged throughout the loop).
   - `mexsize`: Starts at 1.
   - `tc`: The value of `tc` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1 (remains unchanged throughout the loop).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each element `sz` in the list `a`:
     - If `sz` equals `mexsize`, increment `mexsize` by 1.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After the loop finishes executing, `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer that is not present in the list `a`.
   - All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, and `tc`) remain unchanged.

Let's formalize this understanding:

- **Output State**: 
  - `t`: Remains the same as the input integer.
  - `n`: Remains the same as the input integer.
  - `a`: Remains the same sorted list of integers.
  - `maxsize`: Remains the same maximum value in the list `a`.
  - `mexsize`: The smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
  - `tc`: Remains the same value as it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

Thus, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is the sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`; `tc` is the value of `tc` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `mexsize` will be the smallest missing positive integer from the sorted list `a`, while all other variables retain their initial values or their values from the previous iteration.
