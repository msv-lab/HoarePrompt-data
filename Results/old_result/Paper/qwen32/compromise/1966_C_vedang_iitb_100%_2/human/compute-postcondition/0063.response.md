Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t`: An input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. This represents the number of test cases.
- `n`: An input integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`.
- `a`: A sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
- `maxsize`: The maximum value in the list `a`.
- `mexsize`: The smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
- `tc`: The value of `tc` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. This variable seems to track the current test case number.
- `mexsize > maxsize`: This implies that the smallest missing positive integer in the list `a` is greater than the maximum value in the list `a`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
```python
print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 0 else 'Bob')
```
This print statement checks if `mexsize` is even or odd:
- If `mexsize` is even (`mexsize % 2 == 0`), it prints 'Alice'.
- If `mexsize` is odd (`mexsize % 2 != 0`), it prints 'Bob'.

### Determining the Output:
Given that `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a` and `mexsize > maxsize`, we know that `mexsize` is a positive integer that is greater than any integer in the list `a`. Since `mexsize` is defined as the smallest missing positive integer, it must be a positive integer starting from 1 and incrementing upwards until it finds a number not in `a`.

However, since `mexsize` is explicitly stated to be greater than `maxsize` and is the smallest missing positive integer, it must be the next integer after `maxsize` if `maxsize` is positive. If `maxsize` is negative or zero, `mexsize` would start from 1.

Given the condition `mexsize > maxsize`, `mexsize` could be any positive integer greater than `maxsize`. But since `mexsize` is the smallest missing positive integer, it must be the smallest integer greater than any element in `a`.

Without the specific values of `a` and `maxsize`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `mexsize`. However, we know that `mexsize` is a positive integer and can be either even or odd.

### Conclusion:
The output will depend on whether `mexsize` is even or odd. Since we don't have the specific value of `mexsize`, we can only describe the output based on the parity of `mexsize`.

Output: **'Alice' if mexsize is even, otherwise 'Bob' (where mexsize is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a` and mexsize > maxsize)**
