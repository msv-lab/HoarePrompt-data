test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a test case. Each tuple contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), two integers x and y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9), and a list of integers a of length n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of elements in all lists a across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
