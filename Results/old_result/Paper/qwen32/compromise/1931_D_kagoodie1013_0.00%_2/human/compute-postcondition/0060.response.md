The code snippet `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` to the `results` list. The other variables (`test_cases`, `mod_x_map`, `mod_y_map`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`) remain unchanged as the loop has finished iterating over `arr`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains n, x, y, and arr; `results` is a list containing the final value of count; `count` is the total count as calculated by the loop; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with keys as mod_x_key and values as their respective counts; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with keys as mod_y_key and values as their respective counts; The current tuple (n, x, y, arr) is the tuple being processed, but the loop has finished iterating over arr; `results` now includes the final value of `count`.**
