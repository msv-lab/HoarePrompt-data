The code snippet provided updates the value of `mod_y_key` to be `num % y`. Given the initial state, all other variables remain unchanged except for `mod_y_key`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is an empty list; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` mapped to 2; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 2; `num` is the next element in `arr`; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `count` is incremented by the sum of the values from `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` corresponding to `mod_x` and `mod_y` respectively, which is 4; `mod_x_key` is `num % x`; `mod_y_key` is `num % y`.**
