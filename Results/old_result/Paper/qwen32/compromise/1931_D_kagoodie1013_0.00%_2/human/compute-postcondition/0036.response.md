The value of `mod_x` is calculated as `-num % x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The `test_cases` list still contains tuples of `(n, x, y, arr)`, `results` still contains the value of `count`, `count` is still 0, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are still empty dictionaries, and `num` is still the first element of `arr`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; The current tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the next tuple in `test_cases` and `arr` must have at least one element; `num` is the first element of `arr`; `mod_x` is `-num % x`.**
