To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is only `i`. The variable `i` is used as an index to iterate over the elements in the iterable `hmp`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `ans` is calculated based on the condition involving `hmp[i]` and `m`.
- `hmp` is an iterable with at least one element.

Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to increment `i` to move to the next element in `hmp`. The state of `ans` does not need to be adjusted because it is recalculated in each iteration based on the current value of `i`.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was pointing to the `k`-th element of `hmp`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should point to the `(k+1)`-th element of `hmp`.

State: **`ans` is `6 * m + m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`; otherwise, `ans` remains `6 * m`. `hmp` is an iterable with at least one element, and `i` is incremented to the next index in `hmp`.**

However, since we do not know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can only describe the state in terms of the next index:

State: **`ans` is to be recalculated as `6 * m + m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`; otherwise, `ans` remains `6 * m`. `hmp` is an iterable with at least one element, and `i` is the next index in `hmp`.**

To be more precise, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`. But without knowing `k`, we can say:

State: **`ans` is to be recalculated based on the new value of `i` according to the loop condition. `hmp` is an iterable with at least one element, and `i` is the next index in `hmp`.**

For simplicity and clarity, we can express the state as:

State: **`ans` is to be recalculated, `hmp` is an iterable with at least one element, and `i` is incremented to the next index in `hmp`.**

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ans` is to be recalculated, `hmp` is an iterable with at least one element, and `i` is the next index in `hmp`.**
