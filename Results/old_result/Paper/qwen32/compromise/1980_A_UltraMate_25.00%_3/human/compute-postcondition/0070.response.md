Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is at least 2, `s` is the input string, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s`. If the current value of `i` is not a key in `hmp`, then `ans` is set to `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
