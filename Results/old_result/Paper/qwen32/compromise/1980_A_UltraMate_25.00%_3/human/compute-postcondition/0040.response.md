Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` is a calculated value, `t` is greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `ans` is `m`, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `hmp` is a Counter object containing characters from `s` as keys and their counts as values. The current value of `i` is not a key in `hmp`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` has been updated to be equal to `m`. All other variables remain unchanged.
