The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. This affects the values of `n` and `m` but does not change the initial state description involving `t` and `hmp`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, 6 * m + Î£(m - hmp[i]) for all i in hmp where hmp[i] < m, t is at least 2**.

In natural language, this means that `n` and `m` now hold the values provided by the user input, while the rest of the initial conditions remain unchanged.
