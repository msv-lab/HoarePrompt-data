To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the formula for `ans`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `ans` is calculated based on two parts:
  1. The sum of `m` for each character in the string `'ABCDEF'` that is not in the dictionary `hmp`.
  2. The sum of `m - hmp[i]` for each key `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i] < m`.

### Calculation Steps:
1. **First Part**: Sum of `m` for characters in `'ABCDEF'` not in `hmp`
   - This part adds `m` for every character in `'ABCDEF'` that does not exist as a key in `hmp`.
   
2. **Second Part**: Sum of `m - hmp[i]` for keys `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i] < m`
   - This part iterates through each key-value pair in `hmp` and adds `m - hmp[i]` to the sum if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `hmp` and `m` have specific values to illustrate the calculation. Suppose:
- `hmp = {'A': 1, 'C': 3, 'E': 5}`
- `m = 6`

#### First Part Calculation:
- Characters in `'ABCDEF'`: A, B, C, D, E, F
- Characters not in `hmp`: B, D, F
- Sum for these characters: `m + m + m = 6 + 6 + 6 = 18`

#### Second Part Calculation:
- Keys in `hmp`: A, C, E
- Values: 1, 3, 5
- For each key, check if `hmp[i] < m`:
  - `hmp['A'] = 1 < 6`: Add `m - hmp['A'] = 6 - 1 = 5`
  - `hmp['C'] = 3 < 6`: Add `m - hmp['C'] = 6 - 3 = 3`
  - `hmp['E'] = 5 < 6`: Add `m - hmp['E'] = 6 - 5 = 1`
- Sum for these keys: `5 + 3 + 1 = 9`

#### Total `ans` Calculation:
- `ans = 18 + 9 = 27`

### General Output Description:
Given the general form without specific values for `hmp` and `m`, the output `ans` will be the sum of `m` for each character in `'ABCDEF'` not in `hmp`, plus the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for each key `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i] < m`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of m for each character in 'ABCDEF' not in hmp, plus the sum of m - hmp[i] for each key i in hmp where hmp[i] < m)**
