Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` and `m` are integers input by the user such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `s` is a string input by the user; `ans` is 0; `p` is 'ABCDEF'.**

In simple terms, the variable `p` has been assigned the string value `'ABCDEF'`. All other variables retain their initial values.
