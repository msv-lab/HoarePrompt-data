Output State: **`ans` is `6 * m + m - hmp[i]`, `hmp` is an iterable with at least one element, and the current value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `m - hmp[i]` to its previous value, which was `6 * m`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
