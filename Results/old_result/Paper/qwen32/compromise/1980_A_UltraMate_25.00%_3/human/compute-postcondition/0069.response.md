Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is at least 2, `s` is the input string, `ans` is `m`, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s`. The current value of `i` is not a key in `hmp`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to be the sum of its previous value (which was 0) and the value of `m`. All other variables remain unchanged.
