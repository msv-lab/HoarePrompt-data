Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case. For each test case, `a` and `b` represent the frequency of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, respectively, and `m` represents the duration for which each firework is visible in the sky. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the given frequencies and visibility duration.**
