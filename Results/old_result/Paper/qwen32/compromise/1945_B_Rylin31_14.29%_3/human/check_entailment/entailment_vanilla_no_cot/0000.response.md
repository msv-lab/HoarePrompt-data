Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's analyze why.

The problem requires finding the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. This involves determining the overlap of the intervals during which fireworks are visible. The key here is to find a time `t` where the maximum number of fireworks from both installations are visible simultaneously. The given program does not account for this correctly.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. The program calculates `mn` as `min(a, b) + m`, which is not necessarily the correct time to check for maximum overlap.
2. The program then checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and if neither `a` nor `b` is 1. If these conditions are met, it adds an extra 1 to the result, which is not correct.
3. The program does not consider the correct intervals and overlaps of fireworks visibility.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find a time `t` where the number of fireworks visible from both installations is maximized. This can be achieved by iterating over possible times or using mathematical insights to find the correct `t`.

Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:

1. Iterate over possible times `t` where fireworks are launched.
2. For each time `t`, calculate the number of fireworks visible from both installations.
3. Keep track of the maximum number of visible fireworks.

However, a more efficient approach involves using the least common multiple (LCM) and mathematical calculations to find the correct `t` without iterating over all possible times.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        max_fireworks = 0
        for t in range(lcm_ab):
            count_a = (t + m) // a
            count_b = (t + m) // b
            max_fireworks = max(max_fireworks, count_a + count_b)
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

This program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and checks the number of fireworks visible for each time `t` within one LCM period. It keeps track of the maximum number of visible fireworks. This approach ensures that we consider all possible overlaps correctly.
