Let's analyze the given program and the problem requirements to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time, given the following:
- Two installations launch fireworks at intervals `a` and `b` minutes respectively.
- Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after its launch.

### Key Observations:
1. **Visibility Period**: A firework launched at time `x` will be visible from `x` to `x + m` inclusive.
2. **Overlap Calculation**: To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the overlap of visibility periods of fireworks launched from both installations.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time using the following logic:
- It calculates `mn` as `min(a, b) + m`, which is the minimum interval plus the visibility duration.
- It then calculates the number of fireworks launched from each installation within this period:
  - `mn // a` gives the number of fireworks launched from the first installation.
  - `mn // b` gives the number of fireworks launched from the second installation.
- The program adds these two values to get the total number of fireworks visible at `mn`.

### Special Case Handling:
- The program includes a special case where it checks if `m` is a multiple of both `a` and `b` and both `a` and `b` are not 1. In this case, it adds an additional 1 to the result.

### Issues with the Program:
The program logic is flawed. Here are the reasons:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Overlap**: The program does not correctly account for the overlap of visibility periods between fireworks from the two installations.
2. **Special Case Misinterpretation**: The special case where `m` is a multiple of both `a` and `b` is not correctly interpreted. The addition of 1 in this case is incorrect and does not account for the actual overlap.
3. **General Case Inadequacy**: The general case does not consider the actual intervals and overlaps, leading to incorrect results.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then calculate the number of fireworks visible within the period `[0, LCM(a, b) + m]`.

### Conclusion:
Given the flaws in the logic and the incorrect handling of overlap and special cases, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
