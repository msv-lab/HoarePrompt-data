### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem requirements to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Sum Condition**: The sum of the subarray `a[l_i:r_i+1]` should be equal to the sum of another array `b[l_i:r_i+1]`.
2. **Non-equality Condition**: For every index `i` in the subarray, `a[i]` should not be equal to `b[i]`.
3. **Positive Condition**: Every element `b[i]` should be greater than 0.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `a` is initialized as a prefix sum array of the input array `c` with an extra 0 at the beginning for easier indexing.
   - `b` is initialized as a prefix sum array where each element is either 1 or 2 based on whether the corresponding element in `a` is greater than 1 or not. This is incorrect because `b` should be constructed based on the subarray sums and not individual elements of `a`.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - `a` is correctly calculated as a prefix sum array.
   - `b` is incorrectly calculated. The program assigns 1 or 2 based on individual elements rather than ensuring that the sum of `b` matches the sum of `a` for any subarray.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program checks if the sum of the subarray `a[l_i:r_i+1]` is less than the sum of the subarray `b[l_i:r_i+1]`. If it is, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".
   - However, the logic for constructing `b` is flawed. The program does not ensure that `b` can be constructed to meet all the conditions for any subarray.

#### Key Issues:
- The program incorrectly constructs `b` based on individual elements of `a` rather than the sum conditions.
- The program does not ensure that `b` can be constructed such that the sum of `b` matches the sum of `a` for any subarray and that each element of `b` is greater than 0 and not equal to the corresponding element of `a`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. The construction of `b` is flawed, and the program does not ensure that all conditions are met for any subarray.

**Correctness: False**
