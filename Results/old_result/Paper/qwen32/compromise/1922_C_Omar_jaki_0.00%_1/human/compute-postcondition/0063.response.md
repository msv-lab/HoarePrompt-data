To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Tuple `a`**: It starts with `-1000000000.0`, followed by `n` elements returned by `r()`, and ends with `2000000000.0`. The second element of this tuple (`a[1]`) is used to compute `u` as `a[1] - 1`, and it must be a truthy value. This means `a[1]` cannot be `0`.

2. **List `b`**: It starts with `[0, 0]` and is followed by `2n` additional elements, making the total length of `b` equal to `2n + 2`. The elements of `b` are computed in each iteration of the loop, but their specific values are not detailed in the initial state.

3. **Variables `c` and `d`**: These are values returned by `r()`, and `c` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to `d`.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

We need to determine the values of `b[c * 2 - 1]` and `b[d * 2 - 1]`.

- Since `c` and `d` are indices derived from the values returned by `r()`, and `c >= d`, the indices `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` will be positions in the list `b`. Specifically, these positions are odd indices because multiplying by 2 and then subtracting 1 always results in an odd number.

- The exact values of `b[c * 2 - 1]` and `b[d * 2 - 1]` depend on the values computed during the loop iterations, which are not specified in the initial state. However, we know that `b` starts with `[0, 0]` and is extended with `2n` more elements.

Since the specific values of `b[c * 2 - 1]` and `b[d * 2 - 1]` are not provided, we can only describe the expression in terms of the list `b` and the indices derived from `c` and `d`.

Output: **b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] (where c and d are values returned by r() such that c >= d, and b is a list starting with [0, 0] and extended with 2n more elements)**
