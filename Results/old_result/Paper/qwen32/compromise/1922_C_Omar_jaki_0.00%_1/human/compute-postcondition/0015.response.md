To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

Given:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus one and must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n+2` integers starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by the original `n` integers in ascending order, and ending with `2000000000.0`.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5.
- `b` is `[0, 0, v, v]`.
- `v` is `y - x`.

Code snippet:
```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

This line appends two new elements to the list `b`. Let's break down the expressions being appended:

1. `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`
   - `b[-2]` refers to the third last element of `b`, which is `v`.
   - `v ** (v > x - w)` evaluates to `v ** True` if `v > x - w`, otherwise `v ** False`.
     - Since `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0`, this simplifies to `v` if `v > x - w`, otherwise `1`.
   - Therefore, the first new element is `v + v` if `v > x - w`, otherwise `v + 1`.

2. `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`
   - `b[-1]` refers to the last element of `b`, which is also `v`.
   - `v ** (v > z - y)` evaluates to `v ** True` if `v > z - y`, otherwise `v ** False`.
     - This simplifies to `v` if `v > z - y`, otherwise `1`.
   - Therefore, the second new element is `v + v` if `v > z - y`, otherwise `v + 1`.

So, the list `b` will be updated as follows:
- If both conditions `v > x - w` and `v > z - y` are true, `b` becomes `[0, 0, v, v, 2*v, 2*v]`.
- If `v > x - w` is true and `v > z - y` is false, `b` becomes `[0, 0, v, v, 2*v, v + 1]`.
- If `v > x - w` is false and `v > z - y` is true, `b` becomes `[0, 0, v, v, v + 1, 2*v]`.
- If both conditions `v > x - w` and `v > z - y` are false, `b` becomes `[0, 0, v, v, v + 1, v + 1]`.

Since the exact values of `x`, `w`, `y`, and `z` are not provided, we cannot determine which of these conditions are true. However, we can express the output state in terms of these conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus one and must be greater than or equal to 0; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n+2` integers starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by the original `n` integers in ascending order, and ending with `2000000000.0`; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `b` is `[0, 0, v, v, v + (v > x - w) * v + (v <= x - w), v + (v > z - y) * v + (v <= z - y)]`.**

This means that the final list `b` will depend on whether `v > x - w` and `v > z - y` are true or false.
