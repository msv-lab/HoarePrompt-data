To determine the new state after the given Python code snippet executes, let's break down the operations step-by-step:

Given:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus one and must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n+2` integers starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by the original `n` integers in ascending order, and ending with `2000000000.0`.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5.
- `b` is `[0, 0, v]`.
- `v` is `y - x`.

The code snippet modifies `b`:
```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

Let's analyze the changes:
- `b[-2]` refers to the second last element of `b`, which is `0`.
- `b[-1]` refers to the last element of `b`, which is `v`.
- `v ** (v > x - w)` evaluates to `v` if `v > x - w` is True, otherwise it evaluates to `1`. However, since the exponentiation operator `**` requires an integer exponent, and `v > x - w` is a boolean, this will raise a TypeError unless `v > x - w` is converted to an integer (`1` for True, `0` for False). Assuming the intention is to use `1` for True and `0` for False, we can proceed with that assumption.
- Similarly, `v ** (v > z - y)` evaluates to `v` if `v > z - y` is True, otherwise it evaluates to `1`.

Thus, the new elements added to `b` are:
- `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)` → `0 + v ** (v > x - w)` → `v ** (v > x - w)`
- `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)` → `v + v ** (v > z - y)`

Therefore, the new `b` list will be `[0, 0, v, v ** (v > x - w), v + v ** (v > z - y)]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus one and must be greater than or equal to 0; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n+2` integers starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by the original `n` integers in ascending order, and ending with `2000000000.0`; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `b` is `[0, 0, v, v ** (v > x - w), v + v ** (v > z - y)]; `v` is `y - x`.**
