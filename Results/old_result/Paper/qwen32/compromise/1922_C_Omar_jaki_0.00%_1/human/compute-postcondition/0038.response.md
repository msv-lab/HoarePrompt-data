Postcondition: **`u` is `r()[0] - 3`; the list is `[non-zero, 0, v1, v2, ..., v(2*n-2), v(2*n-1)]`; `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()` such that `r()[0]` is not 2. If `c < d`, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part. In both cases, the values of `u`, the list, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged.**
