`t` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `u` is 0; `t` is now `t-1`; the list `b` remains potentially modified; `a` is a tuple with at least \( n+2 \) elements, starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by \( n \) elements returned by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`.
