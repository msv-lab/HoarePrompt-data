Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. The main issue is that the program only attempts to split the number at the `p-1` index if the list is not sorted and the number at `p-1` is greater than 10 and greater than the number at `p`. However, this approach is insufficient because:

1. The program does not consider the possibility of needing to split multiple numbers to achieve a sorted array.
2. The program does not guarantee that splitting a number at `p-1` will lead to a sorted array or even improve the situation.
3. The program does not handle cases where splitting a number at `p-1` might make the array more sortable but the program does not explore further splits.
4. The program does not handle cases where splitting a number at a different index might be necessary to achieve a sorted array.

A correct solution would involve checking if the array can be made sorted by attempting to split any number that is greater than or equal to 10 and checking if the resulting array is sorted. This would likely require a more thorough exploration of all possible splits.

Correctness: **False**
