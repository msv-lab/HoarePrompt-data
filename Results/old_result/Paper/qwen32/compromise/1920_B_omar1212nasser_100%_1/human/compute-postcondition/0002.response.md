The code appends a new value to the list `pos`. This new value is calculated as `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`. Given that `s` is the sum of `elements`, the expression `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` can be simplified to the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.

Output State: **removals and negatives are non-negative integers, and elements is a list of integers; pos is a list containing one element which is `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`; s is the sum of elements.**
