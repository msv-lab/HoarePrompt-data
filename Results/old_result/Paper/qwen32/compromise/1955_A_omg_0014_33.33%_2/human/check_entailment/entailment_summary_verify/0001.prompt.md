You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then calculates and prints either `a * b` or `round(a * c / 2)` based on which value is smaller.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts. There are two options:
1. Buy each yogurt at a price of `a` burles.
2. Buy two yogurts at a price of `b` burles.

The goal is to find the minimum cost for `n` yogurts, considering these options.

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Input Parsing Error**:
   - The input parsing is incorrect. The correct input format is `n`, followed by `t` test cases, where each test case contains `n`, `a`, and `b`. The current code incorrectly interprets the first input as the number of test cases and then reads `(a, b, c)` for each test case. `c` is not defined in the problem; it should be `b`.

2. **Logic Error**:
   - The logic is fundamentally flawed. The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, but `c` is not defined in the problem. It should be `b / 2`. However, even if `c` were `b`, the logic `a * b < a * d` is incorrect. The correct logic should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price versus the promotional price.
   - The logic should be:
     - Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought using the promotion: `pairs = n // 2`.
     - Calculate the number of yogurts that will be bought at the regular price: `remaining = n % 2`.
     - The total cost is then `pairs * b + remaining * a`.

3. **Output Error**:
   - The output logic is incorrect. The program should output the total cost calculated based on the optimal strategy, not the comparison between `a * b` and `a * d`.

### Correct Implementation

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        total_cost = pairs * b + remaining * a
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect due to input parsing errors, logic errors, and output errors.

Correctness: **False**
