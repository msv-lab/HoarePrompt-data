Output State: **`ans` is a list containing the first `lk - 1` powers of 2, followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and then `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The list `ans` originally contains the first `lk - 1` powers of 2, followed by the value `k - 1 - sum(ans)`. After the code `ans.append(k + 1)` is executed, `k + 1` is added to the end of the list `ans`. Therefore, the final list `ans` includes all the previous elements plus the new element `k + 1`.
