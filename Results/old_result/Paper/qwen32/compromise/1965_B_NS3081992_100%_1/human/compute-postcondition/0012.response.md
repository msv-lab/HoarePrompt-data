The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `ans`. No other variables are modified. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, and `bk` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, with `n` and `k` updated to the values returned by `func_7()`. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. `k` is not equal to 1. `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `ans` is an empty list.**
