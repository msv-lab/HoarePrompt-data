The function `func_13` takes two integer parameters, `a` (the dividend) and `b` (the divisor). If `b` is 0, it returns the tuple (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calculates and returns a tuple (y, x - a // b * y, g), where y, x, and g are determined by the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`, along with the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity.
