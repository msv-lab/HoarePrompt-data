Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. The logic in the code is flawed and does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations.

Let's analyze the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if m < a or m < b:
            print(2)
        else:
            print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

The logic in the program is incorrect for several reasons:
1. The condition `if m < a or m < b` is incorrect. Just because `m` is less than `a` or `b` does not mean that the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2. For example, if `a = 3`, `b = 4`, and `m = 2`, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time should be calculated based on the overlaps, not just 2.
2. The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is incorrect. It does not account for the overlaps of fireworks from both installations. For example, if `a = 6`, `b = 7`, and `m = 4`, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2, not `4 // 6 + 4 // 7 + 2 = 2`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, and then calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the range `[0, m]`, taking into account the overlaps.

A correct approach would involve:
1. Calculating the LCM of `a` and `b`.
2. Counting the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within `[0, m]`.
3. Counting the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within `[0, m]`.
4. Counting the number of fireworks launched by both installations at the same time (i.e., the number of fireworks launched at multiples of the LCM within `[0, m]`).
5. Using the inclusion-exclusion principle to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
import math

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // math.gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        count_a = m // a + 1
        count_b = m // b + 1
        count_ab = m // lcm_ab + 1
        max_fireworks = count_a + count_b - count_ab
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

This corrected version properly calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time by considering the overlaps correctly.
