Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the matrix for that test case. It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.**
