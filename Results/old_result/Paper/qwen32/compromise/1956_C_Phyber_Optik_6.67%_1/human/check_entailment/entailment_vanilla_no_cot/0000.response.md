Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly compute the maximum sum of the matrix or generate the correct sequence of operations to achieve it. There are several issues:

1. **Sum Calculation**: The logic for calculating the sum is incorrect. The program attempts to calculate the sum in a way that does not reflect the maximum possible sum achievable by the operations. The maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix with the numbers 1 through n in a way that each number appears exactly once in each row and each column, which is equivalent to filling the matrix with a Latin square.

2. **Operations**: The operations described in the output are not optimal and do not necessarily lead to the maximum sum. The program incorrectly alternates between row and column operations without ensuring that the maximum sum is achieved.

3. **Output Format**: The output format for the operations is correct, but the operations themselves do not achieve the maximum sum.

Here is a corrected approach to solve the problem:

1. **Maximum Sum Calculation**: The maximum sum is achieved when the matrix is filled with the numbers 1 through n such that each number appears exactly once in each row and each column. This can be done by filling the matrix with a Latin square, which gives a sum of \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

2. **Operations**: To achieve this, we can perform n Type 1 operations, setting each row to a permutation that ensures the Latin square property. Specifically, the i-th row can be set to the permutation \([1, 2, ..., n]\) shifted by \(i-1\) positions.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)
        print(max_sum, n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*(j % n + 1 for j in range(i - 1, i + n - 1)))

func()
```

This corrected code ensures that the maximum sum is achieved and that the number of operations is no more than 2n, as required.
