You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the size of a matrix. For each test case, it calculates and prints a sum and a value `n + r`, followed by a series of lines describing operations on the matrix. The final state of the program after processing all test cases is the output of the calculated sums, values, and matrix operations for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all the numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a limited number of operations. The operations involve filling rows or columns with permutations of numbers from 1 to n.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.

2. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

3. It initializes `sum` to 0 and `r` to 0. The variable `sum` is supposed to hold the maximum sum of the matrix, and `r` is used to determine the number of additional operations needed beyond the `n` operations.

4. The loop `for i in range(1, n + 1)` calculates the sum by adding the maximum possible sum for each row or column. The maximum possible sum for a row or column is the sum of numbers from 1 to n, which is `n * (n + 1) // 2`. The program adds this sum to `sum` for each row until the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is no longer true. After that, it adds `i * n` to `sum` for the remaining rows. However, this logic is flawed because it does not correctly calculate the maximum possible sum for the matrix. The correct approach would be to simply add `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each row, as the maximum sum for each row is always the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

5. The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is `n + r`. However, `r` is not correctly calculated to represent the number of additional operations needed. The correct number of operations should always be `2n` since we can fill all rows and all columns with permutations to maximize the sum.

6. The program then prints the operations. It prints `n` operations to fill each row with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` and `r` operations to fill each column with the same permutation. However, `r` is not correctly calculated, and the operations are not necessary to maximize the sum. The correct approach would be to print `n` operations to fill each row and `n` operations to fill each column.

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum or the number of operations, and the operations printed are not necessary to maximize the sum.
