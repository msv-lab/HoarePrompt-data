The `print` statement in the given code snippet is `print(1, j, end=' ')`. This statement will print the values of the integers 1 and `j`, separated by a space, and the `end` parameter is set to a space, which means after printing the values, it will not move to the next line but will leave the cursor at the end of the printed text.

From the initial state, we know that:
- `j` is 6

So, the value 1 will be printed first, followed by the value of `j` which is 6, and they will be separated by a space. Since the `end` parameter is set to a space, there will be an additional space at the end of the printed text.

Output: **1 6 **
