The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, meaning `i` has just been incremented. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration, which is `i + 1`.

The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop iterations, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
