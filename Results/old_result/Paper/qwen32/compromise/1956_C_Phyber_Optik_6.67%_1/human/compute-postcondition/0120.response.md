Let's break down the `print` statement provided in the task:

```
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

From the initial state, we have the following variable values:
- `sum` is 90 (though it is not used in the print statement)
- `r` is 2 (though it is not used in the print statement)
- `n` is 5
- `t` is 2 (though it is not used in the print statement)
- `j` is 3

The print statement includes two values:
1. The integer `2`
2. The result of the expression `j % n`

Let's calculate `j % n`:
- `j` is 3
- `n` is 5
- The modulus operation `j % n` computes the remainder of the division of `j` by `n`. In this case, `3 % 5` equals `3` because 3 divided by 5 is 0 with a remainder of 3.

The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function specifies that the output should end with a space instead of the default newline character.

Combining these, the `print` statement will output the integer `2`, followed by the result of `j % n` (which is `3`), separated by a space, and ending with a space.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2 3 **
