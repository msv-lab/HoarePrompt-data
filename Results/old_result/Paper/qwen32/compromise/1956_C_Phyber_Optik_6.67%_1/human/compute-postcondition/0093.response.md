The value of `sum` is updated by adding the result of `n * (n + 1) // 2` to it. The values of `r`, `n`, `t`, and `j` remain unchanged. The condition that `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n` still holds as it was a precondition.

Output State: **`sum` is `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`, `r` is `i`, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `j` is 8, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`.**
