Let's analyze the given Python code snippet in the context of the provided initial state.

Initial State:
- `sum` is 75
- `r` is 2
- `n` is 0
- `j` is 1

The code snippet is:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the `range` function and the `print` statement:

1. The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from the first argument (inclusive) and ending at the second argument (exclusive).
2. In this case, `range(1, n + 1)` translates to `range(1, 0 + 1)` which simplifies to `range(1, 1)`.
3. `range(1, 1)` generates no numbers because the start value (1) is not less than the end value (1).

The `*` operator in the `print` statement is used to unpack the sequence generated by `range`. Since `range(1, 1)` generates no numbers, there is nothing to unpack and print.

Therefore, the `print` statement will not print anything.

Output: **(nothing)**
