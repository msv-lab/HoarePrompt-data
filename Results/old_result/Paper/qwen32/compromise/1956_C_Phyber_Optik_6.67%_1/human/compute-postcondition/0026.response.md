Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state step by step.

Initial State:
- `sum` is 75
- `r` is 2
- `n` is 0
- `j` is less than or equal to 0

The code snippet is:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

Here, `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n + 1`. Given that `n` is 0, `n + 1` equals 1. Thus, `range(1, 1)` generates an empty sequence because the start value (1) is not less than the stop value (1).

The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the sequence generated by `range`. Since the sequence is empty, there are no values to unpack and print.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output nothing.

Output: **(nothing)**
