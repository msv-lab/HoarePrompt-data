The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to the range specified in the loop head. The range is from 1 to `n + r + 1`, which in this case is from 1 to `5 + 2 + 1 = 8`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` can be either 1 (if `j` is less than or equal to `n`) or greater than 5 (if `j` is greater than `n`). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be within the range but not yet at the end of the range. Since the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, `j` should be set to the next value in the sequence.

Given that `j` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `j` should be 3.

State: **`sum` is 90, `r` is 2, `n` is 5, `t` is 2, `j` is 3**
