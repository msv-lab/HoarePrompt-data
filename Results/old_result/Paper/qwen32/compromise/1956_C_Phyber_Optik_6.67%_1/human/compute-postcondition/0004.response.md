To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. This means the variables `i` and `n` are the only ones we can adjust.

The loop will execute if the range `(1, n + 1)` is not empty, which means `n` must be at least 1. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 1 at the start of the loop, so we don't need to adjust `i` before the loop starts.

The other variables (`t`, `sum`, `r`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. However, `t` is mentioned to be an integer representing the number of test cases and must be at least 1, so we should ensure that this condition is met, although it doesn't affect the loop directly.

Given this, the necessary adjustments are to ensure that `n` is at least 1, as this is the only condition that affects the execution of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0**
