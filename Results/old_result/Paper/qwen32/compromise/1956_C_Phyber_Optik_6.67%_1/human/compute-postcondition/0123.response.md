The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n + r + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, `n` is 5, and `r` is 2. Therefore, `n + r + 1` equals 8. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`sum` is 90, `r` is 2, `n` is 5, `t` is 2, and `j` is 4**
