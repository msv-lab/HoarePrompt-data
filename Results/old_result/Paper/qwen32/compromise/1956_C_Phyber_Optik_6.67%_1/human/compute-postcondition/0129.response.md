To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop operates and how the variables evolve.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
    if j <= n:
        print(1, j, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))
    else:
        print(2, j % n, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

Given the initial state:
- `sum` is 90
- `r` is 2
- `n` is 5
- `t` is 2
- `j` is 8

The loop variable `j` will iterate from 1 to `n + r`, which is `5 + 2 = 7`. Therefore, `j` will take values from 1 to 7.

Let's break down the loop iterations:

1. **Iteration 1 (j = 1)**:
   - Since `j <= n` (1 <= 5), it prints `1 1` followed by the range `1 2 3 4 5`.
   
2. **Iteration 2 (j = 2)**:
   - Since `j <= n` (2 <= 5), it prints `1 2` followed by the range `1 2 3 4 5`.
   
3. **Iteration 3 (j = 3)**:
   - Since `j <= n` (3 <= 5), it prints `1 3` followed by the range `1 2 3 4 5`.
   
4. **Iteration 4 (j = 4)**:
   - Since `j <= n` (4 <= 5), it prints `1 4` followed by the range `1 2 3 4 5`.
   
5. **Iteration 5 (j = 5)**:
   - Since `j <= n` (5 <= 5), it prints `1 5` followed by the range `1 2 3 4 5`.
   
6. **Iteration 6 (j = 6)**:
   - Since `j > n` (6 > 5), it prints `2 1` (since `6 % 5 = 1`) followed by the range `1 2 3 4 5`.
   
7. **Iteration 7 (j = 7)**:
   - Since `j > n` (7 > 5), it prints `2 2` (since `7 % 5 = 2`) followed by the range `1 2 3 4 5`.

The variables `sum`, `r`, `n`, and `t` do not get modified inside the loop, so they remain unchanged. The variable `j` will be 7 after the loop completes all iterations.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **sum is 90, r is 2, n is 5, t is 2, j is 7.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `j` will be 7, and the other variables `sum`, `r`, `n`, and `t` will remain at their initial values.
