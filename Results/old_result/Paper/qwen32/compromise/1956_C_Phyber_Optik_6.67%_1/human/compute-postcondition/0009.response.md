The value of `sum` is updated by adding `i * n` to its current value. The values of `t`, `n`, `r`, and the precondition `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 1, `sum` is `sum + i * n`, `r` is 0, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`.**
