To determine what will be printed, let's break down the print statement and evaluate the expressions using the given initial state.

The print statement is:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

We need to evaluate the expression `j % n`:
- `j` is 6.
- `n` is 5.

The modulus operator `%` computes the remainder of the division of `j` by `n`. Therefore:
- `6 % 5` is 1 (since 6 divided by 5 is 1 with a remainder of 1).

The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function specifies that a space should be used instead of a newline at the end of the output.

So, the print statement will output:
- The integer `2`.
- The result of `j % n`, which is `1`.
- A space at the end.

Putting it all together, the output will be:
Output: **2 1 **
