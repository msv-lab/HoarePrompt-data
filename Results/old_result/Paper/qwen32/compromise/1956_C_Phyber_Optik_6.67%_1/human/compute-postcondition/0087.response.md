The only variable in the loop head is `t`, as the loop iterates `_ in range(t)`. This means the loop will execute `t` times. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `t` accordingly.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is 1. Since the loop iterates `t` times, after one iteration, `t` would be decremented to 0, and the loop would terminate. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be incremented to 2 at the start of the next iteration.

The other variables (`sum`, `r`, `n`, `j`) are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

State: **`sum` is 110, `r` is 1, `n` is 5, `t` is 2, `j` is 8**
