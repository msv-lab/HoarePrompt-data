The code snippet `print(*range(1, n + 1))` uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and then prints these numbers.

Given the initial state, we know that `n` is 5. Therefore, `range(1, n + 1)` translates to `range(1, 6)`, which generates the sequence of numbers from 1 to 5.

The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the sequence generated by `range` and prints each number separated by a space.

Thus, the `print` statement will output the numbers 1 through 5 separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 4 5**
