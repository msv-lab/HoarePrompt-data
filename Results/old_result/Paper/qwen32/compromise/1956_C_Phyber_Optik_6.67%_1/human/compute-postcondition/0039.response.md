To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet:

Initial State:
- `sum` is 75
- `r` is 2
- `n` is 0
- `j` is 2

The code snippet is:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

First, we need to evaluate the arguments passed to the `range` function. The `range` function here is called with:
- Start value: `1`
- Stop value: `n + 1` which is `0 + 1` or `1`

The `range(1, 1)` generates an empty sequence because the start value is the same as the stop value. The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the range object, so printing an empty range will result in no output.

Therefore, the `print` statement will not print anything.

Output: **(nothing)**
