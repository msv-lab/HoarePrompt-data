To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the code and the initial state provided.

### Initial State:
- `sum` is 110
- `r` is 1
- `n` is 5
- `t` is 1
- `j` is 5

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Explanation:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive). Given that `n` is 5, `range(1, n + 1)` will generate numbers from 1 to 5.
- The `*` operator before `range(1, n + 1)` in the `print` function unpacks the sequence generated by `range`, so each number in the sequence is printed as a separate argument to `print`.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will output the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 separated by spaces.

### Output:
Output: **1 2 3 4 5**
