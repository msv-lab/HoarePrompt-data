Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `r` is equal to `i` and `sum` is updated to `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `sum` is updated to its current value plus `i * n`.**
