You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, l and r are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `input` is `sys.stdin.readline`; `nums` is a list of integers read from input with an additional -1 appended to it; `s` is `N` (the last index of the `nums` list); `e` is 0; `num` is `-1` (the last element of the `nums` list); `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in the `nums` list.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations will be that the variables `l` and `r` will hold the values of the last query processed, and the variables `eli`, `s`, `e`, and the print outputs will reflect the result of the last query. The state of other variables such as `t`, `N`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `nums`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `arr`, and `LA` will remain unchanged from their last known states before the loop started processing the queries.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n`, a list of `n` integers `a`, and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. Each query consists of two integers `l` and `r`. The function returns a result for each query, which is not specified in the output details provided. The constraints ensure that `t` is between 1 and 10,000, `n` is between 2 and 200,000 for each test case, each integer in `a` is between 1 and 1,000,000, and `q` is between 1 and 200,000 for each test case. Additionally, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 200,000, and the sum of `q` across all test cases does not exceed 200,000.
