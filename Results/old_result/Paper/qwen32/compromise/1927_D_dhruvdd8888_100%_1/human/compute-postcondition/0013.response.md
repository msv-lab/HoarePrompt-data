Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n`, a list of `n` integers `a`, and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. Each query consists of two integers `l` and `r`. The function returns a result for each query, which is not specified in the output details provided. The constraints ensure that `t` is between 1 and 10,000, `n` is between 2 and 200,000 for each test case, each integer in `a` is between 1 and 1,000,000, and `q` is between 1 and 200,000 for each test case. Additionally, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 200,000, and the sum of `q` across all test cases does not exceed 200,000.**
