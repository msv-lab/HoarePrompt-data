You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list containing multiple test cases. Each test case is represented as a list where the first element is a list of two integers [n, k] with 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and the second element is a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, where each rating is a unique integer between 1 and 10^9. The total number of cows across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1(a):
    x = a[k]
    ind = []
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > x:
            ind.append(i)
            c += 1
        
        if c == 2:
            break
        
    #State: a is a list containing multiple test cases, x is the value at index k-1 of the ratings list of the first test case, ind is a list containing up to 2 indices of ratings greater than x, c is the count of ratings greater than x (0, 1, or 2).
    if (ind == []) :
        return n - 1
        #The program returns n - 1
    #State: a is a list containing multiple test cases, x is the value at index k-1 of the ratings list of the first test case, ind is a list containing up to 2 indices of ratings greater than x, c is the count of ratings greater than x (0, 1, or 2). ind is not an empty list.
    if (len(ind) == 1) :
        if (ind[0] == 0) :
            return k - 1
            #The program returns `k - 1`
        #State: a is a list containing multiple test cases, x is the value at index k-1 of the ratings list of the first test case, ind is a list containing exactly 1 index of a rating greater than x, c is the count of ratings greater than x (which is 1 in this case), ind is not an empty list, and the first element of ind is not 0.
        if (ind[0] > k) :
            return ind[0] - 1
            #The program returns the value of ind[0] minus 1, which is an index of a rating greater than x in the first test case, adjusted by subtracting 1. Since ind[0] is greater than k and the first element of ind is not 0, the returned value is a valid index that is one less than the original index.
        #State: a is a list containing multiple test cases, x is the value at index k-1 of the ratings list of the first test case, ind is a list containing exactly 1 index of a rating greater than x, c is the count of ratings greater than x (which is 1 in this case), ind is not an empty list, the first element of ind is not 0, and ind[0] is less than or equal to k
        return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)
        #The program returns the larger value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`
    #State: a is a list containing multiple test cases, x is the value at index k-1 of the ratings list of the first test case, ind is a list containing up to 2 indices of ratings greater than x, c is the count of ratings greater than x (0, 1, or 2). ind is not an empty list, and the length of ind is not equal to 1.
    if (ind[0] == 0) :
        return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)
        #The program returns the minimum value between `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`
    #State: a is a list containing multiple test cases, x is the value at index k-1 of the ratings list of the first test case, ind is a list containing up to 2 indices of ratings greater than x, c is the count of ratings greater than x (0, 1, or 2). ind is not an empty list, and the length of ind is not equal to 1. ind[0] is not equal to 0.
    if (k > ind[1]) :
        return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])
        #The program returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
    #State: a is a list containing multiple test cases, x is the value at index k-1 of the ratings list of the first test case, ind is a list containing up to 2 indices of ratings greater than x, c is the count of ratings greater than x (0, 1, or 2). ind is not an empty list, and the length of ind is not equal to 1. ind[0] is not equal to 0. Additionally, k is less than or equal to ind[1]
    return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])
    #The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case consists of two elements: a list `[n, k]` where `n` is the number of cows and `k` is an integer such that `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, and a list of `n` unique integers representing the ratings of the cows. The function returns different values based on specific conditions:

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns n - 1

Case_2: The program returns `k - 1`

Case_3: The program returns the value of ind[0] minus 1, which is an index of a rating greater than x in the first test case, adjusted by subtracting 1. Since ind[0] is greater than k and the first element of ind is not 0, the returned value is a valid index that is one less than the original index.

Case_4: The program returns the larger value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`

Case_5: The program returns the minimum value between `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`

Case_6: The program returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.

Case_7: The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`
