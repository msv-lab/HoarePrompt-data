Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts four integers `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4` (0 ≤ p1, p2, p3, p4 ≤ 200) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on these counts.**
