Let's break down the given code step by step based on the initial state provided.

The code is designed to process multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four integers, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4`, representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence, respectively. The goal is to compute a specific value for each test case and print these values separated by newlines.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The first line of input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, the next line contains four integers: `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the code reads the four integers `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4`.
   - It then calculates a value using the formula `sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3`.

3. **Formula Explanation**:
   - `enumerate(map(int, input().split()))` reads the four integers and pairs each with its index.
   - For each pair `(i, x)`:
     - `x // 2` calculates the integer division of `x` by 2.
     - `3 * (x // 2)` multiplies the result by 3.
     - `x % 2` calculates the remainder of `x` divided by 2.
     - `x % 2 * (i < 3)` multiplies the remainder by 1 if the index `i` is less than 3 (i.e., for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`), and by 0 if `i` is 3 (i.e., for `p4`).
     - The expression `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)` combines these two parts.
   - `sum(...)` adds up all these calculated values for the four integers.
   - `// 3` performs integer division of the sum by 3.

4. **Output**:
   - The result of the calculation for each test case is printed, and the results for all test cases are separated by newlines.

Given this understanding, the output will be a series of integers, each representing the result of the calculation for a corresponding test case.

Output: **result1\nresult2\n...\nresultt (where result1, result2, ..., resultt are the calculated values for each of the t test cases)**
