The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and k (0 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the number of items and the number of items Bob can take for free, respectively. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the prices of the items for Alice. The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9) representing the prices of the items for Bob. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
