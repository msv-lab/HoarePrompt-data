The code snippet increments `sub_summ` by the first element of `val_a`, which is the second tuple in `sec_arr`. Given that `sub_summ` was initially `2 * val_a[0]`, after the code executes, `sub_summ` will be `3 * val_a[0]`.

Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `val_a` is the second tuple in `sec_arr`, `sub_summ` is `3 * val_a[0]`**.
