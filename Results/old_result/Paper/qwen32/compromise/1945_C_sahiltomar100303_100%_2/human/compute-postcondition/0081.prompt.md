Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` (from `mid` to `n-1`), `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` (from `mid` to `n-1`), `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` (from `mid` to `n-1`), `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` (from `mid` to `n-1`), `left` is `n // 2`, `leftMove` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and `n > 0`, `s` is an input string such that `leftZero` (count of '0's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`) is less than `n // 4 + 1` and `rightOne` (count of '1's in the second half of `s` (from `mid` to `n-1`)) is less than `n // 4 + 1`. `mid` is `n // 2`, `left` is `n // 2 - 1`, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0', `leftZero` is decreased by 1 and `rightZero` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` is decreased by 1 and `rightOne` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and `n > 0`, `s` is an input string. If the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is decreased by 1 and `rightZero` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `rightOne` is increased by 1 and `leftOne` is decreased by 1. `mid` is `n // 2`, `left` is `n // 2 - 2`, and `leftMove` is 0. The conditions on `leftZero` and `rightOne` are maintained as specified.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and `n > 0`, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `left` is `n // 2 - 3`, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` must be less than `(left + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is decreased by 1 and `rightZero` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` is one less than its previous value and `rightOne` is one more than its previous value.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
