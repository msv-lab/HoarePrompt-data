Postcondition: **`left` is either 0 or not 0, `right` is either `n` or less than `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0' and 1 otherwise, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `trightOne` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0' and 0 otherwise, `i` is 0.**

This postcondition summarizes the states of the variables after the if-else block, considering both the cases where `s[i]` is '0' and where it is not '0'.
