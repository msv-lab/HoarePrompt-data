Postcondition: **left is not 0, right is not equal to n, tleftZero is at least (n + 1) // 2, trightOne is at least 0. If the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and left is less than or equal to the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and right, then the condition in the if part holds. Otherwise, the condition in the else part holds.**
