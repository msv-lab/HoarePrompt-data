Postcondition: **left is not equal to 0, s is "001011", leftZero is -2, leftOne is -1, mid is 3, tleftOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, rightZero is 3, rightOne is 3, trightZero is 2, trightOne is 0, leftMove is 0, right is 6, and right equals n. If left is equal to 0, then tleftZero is either greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2 or less than (n + 1) // 2.**
