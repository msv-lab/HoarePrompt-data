Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer; `left` is 0 if the initial condition was `left == 0`, otherwise `left` is not 0; `s` is the value of the user's input; `leftZero` is 0; `rightOne` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne`, `mid`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero` remain unchanged; if `right` is not equal to `n`, `right` remains 4; if `right` is equal to `n` and `left` is 0, `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2` based on the condition; if `right` equals `n` and `left` is not 0, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`; if `right` does not equal `n` and `left` is not 0, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`; `tleftZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 0`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid):
    if s[i] == '0':
        leftZero += 1
        tleftZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne += 1
        tleftOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an input integer; `left` is 0 if the initial condition was `left == 0`, otherwise `left` is not 0; `s` is the value of the user's input; `leftZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0; `rightOne` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is `leftOne + 1` if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise it remains unchanged; `mid`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero` remain unchanged; if `right` is not equal to `n`, `right` remains 4; if `right` equals `n` and `left` is 0, `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2` based on the condition; if `right` equals `n` and `left` is not 0, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`; if `right` does not equal `n` and `left` is not 0, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`; `tleftZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it remains 0; `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1` if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise it remains unchanged; `trightOne` is 0; `mid` must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an input integer; `left` is 0 if the initial condition was `left == 0`, otherwise `left` is not 0; `s` is the value of the user's input; `leftZero` is 2 if `s[i]` was '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 1; `rightOne` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is `leftOne + 1` if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise it remains unchanged; `mid` must be greater than 0; `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero` remain unchanged; if `right` is not equal to `n`, `right` remains 4; if `right` equals `n` and `left` is 0, `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2` based on the condition; if `right` equals `n` and `left` is not 0, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`; if `right` does not equal `n` and `left` is not 0, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`; `tleftZero` is 2 if `s[i]` was '0', otherwise `tleftZero` is 1; `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1` if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise it remains unchanged; `trightOne` is 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `mid` remains unchanged. If `s[i]` is '0', `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are incremented by 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an input integer; `left` is 0 if the initial condition was `left == 0`, otherwise `left` is not 0; `s` is the value of the user's input; `rightOne` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `mid` must be greater than 0; `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero` remain unchanged; if `right` is not equal to `n`, `right` remains 4; if `right` equals `n` and `left` is 0, `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2` based on the condition; if `right` equals `n` and `left` is not 0, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`; if `right` does not equal `n` and `left` is not 0, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`; `i` is incremented by 1; `mid` remains unchanged. If `s[i]` is '0', `leftZero` is 3 and `tleftZero` is 4. Otherwise, `leftZero` is 2, `tleftZero` is 2, and `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
