The code snippet `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of `tleftOne` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged as per the provided initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `left` is 0 if the initial condition was `left == 0`, otherwise `left` is not 0; `s` is the value of the user's input; `leftZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0; `rightOne` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is `leftOne + 1` (incremented by 1); `mid` must be greater than 0; `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1`; `trightOne` remains 0; `tleftZero` remains 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it remains 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `mid` remains unchanged**.
