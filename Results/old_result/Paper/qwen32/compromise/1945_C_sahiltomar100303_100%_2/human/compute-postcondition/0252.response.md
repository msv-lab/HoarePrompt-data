Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is -1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0; `rightOne` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `rightOne` is 1; `rightZero` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0'; `leftOne` is 0 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0'; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightOne` is 1; `tleftOne` is 1; `trightZero` is 1`. If `right` is not equal to `n`, then `right` remains 4. If `right` is equal to `n`, then `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2` depending on the condition.**
