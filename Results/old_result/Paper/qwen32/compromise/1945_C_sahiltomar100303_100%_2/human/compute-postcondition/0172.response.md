Output State: **`left` is either 0 or not 0, `right` is either `n` or less than `n`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightOne` is 0, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `rightZero` is 1, `leftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 2, `tleftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is `mid`, and `s[i]` is '0'.**

Natural Language: The value of `trightZero` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
