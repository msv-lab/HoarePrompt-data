The code snippet `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `left` is 1
- `leftZero` is -3 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is -2
- `rightOne` is 3 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', `rightOne` is not mentioned to be changed
- `rightZero` is 3 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is 2
- `leftOne` is -1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `leftOne` is 0
- `n` is at least 5

After executing the code snippet, `rightZero` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `rightZero` was initially 3, it will become 4. If `rightZero` was initially 2, it will become 3.

Output State: **`left` is 1, `leftZero` is -3 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is -2; `rightOne` is 3 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0'; `rightZero` is 4 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is 3; `leftOne` is -1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `leftOne` is 0; `n` is at least 5.**
