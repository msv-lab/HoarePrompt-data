Output State: **`left` is 1, `leftZero` is -1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 3 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', `rightOne` is 3 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', `rightZero` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', `leftOne` is -1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', `n` is at least 5.**

In simpler terms, the value of `rightOne` is incremented by 1, making it 3, regardless of the character at index 0 of the string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
