Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 3`, `tleftZero` is less than `(mid + 3) // 2 + 1` if `s[right - 1]` is '0', otherwise `tleftZero` is less than `(mid + 3) // 2`. `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid - 1) // 2` - 1 if `s[right - 1]` is '1', otherwise `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid - 1) // 2`. `n` is greater than `mid`. If `s[right - 1]` is '0', `trightZero` is `trightZero - 1`. If `s[right - 1]` is '1', `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `right` is incremented by 1, so `right` is now `mid + 3`. The conditions for `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, `trightZero`, and `tleftOne` are based on the value of `s[right - 1]` (which is the previous value of `s[right]` before the increment). All other variables remain unchanged.
