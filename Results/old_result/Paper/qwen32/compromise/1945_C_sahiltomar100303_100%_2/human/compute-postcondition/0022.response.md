The code snippet provided increments the variable `leftZero` by 1. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `i`) are modified by the code snippet. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is incremented by 1, `leftZero` is increased by 1.**
