Output State: **`left` is either 0 or not 0, `right` is either `n` or less than `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is 2, `leftZero` is 2 if `s[1]` is '0', otherwise 1, `tleftZero` is 2 if `s[1]` is '0', otherwise 1, `leftOne` is incremented by 1 if `s[1]` is not '0' and then incremented by 1 again, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 1 if `s[1]` is not '0', otherwise 0, and `tleftOne` is incremented by 1 if `s[1]` is not '0'**

In simpler terms, the value of `leftOne` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
