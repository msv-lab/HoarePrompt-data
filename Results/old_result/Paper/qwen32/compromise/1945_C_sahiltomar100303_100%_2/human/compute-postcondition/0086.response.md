Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is `mid`, `tleftZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2` plus 1, `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `s[right]` is '0', `trightZero` is `trightZero - 1`.**

In simple terms: The value of `trightZero` has been decreased by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
