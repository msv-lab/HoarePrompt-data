Output State: **`t` is an input integer, the input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (3 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses. The next line contains a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident wants to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident wants to live on the right side. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.**

In simpler terms: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first input, which is the number of test cases. The other conditions about the test cases remain unchanged.
