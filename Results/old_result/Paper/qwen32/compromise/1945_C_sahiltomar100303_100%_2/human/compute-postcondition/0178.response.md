Output State: **`left` is either 0 or not 0, `right` is either `n` or less than `n`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is `mid + 1`, `rightZero` is 2, `trightZero` is 2. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` was 1 and `trightZero` was 2. Otherwise, `rightOne` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `rightZero` is incremented by 1. Initially, if `s[i]` is '0', `rightZero` was 1, so now it is 2. The value of `trightZero` remains 2 as it is not affected by the increment operation. All other variables remain unchanged.
