The code snippet `right = mid` assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `right`. The other variables (`left`, `leftZero`, `rightOne`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is -1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0; `rightOne` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `rightOne` is 1; `rightZero` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0'; `leftOne` is 0 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0'; `right` is `mid`**.
