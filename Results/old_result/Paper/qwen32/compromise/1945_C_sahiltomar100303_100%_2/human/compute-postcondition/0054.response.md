Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `rightZero` is incremented by 1, `trightZero` is 4 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise 2, `rightOne` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0', and incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', `i` is `mid + 2`. If `s[i]` is '0', `trightZero` is 4; otherwise, `trightZero` is 2 and `rightOne` is incremented by 1.**
