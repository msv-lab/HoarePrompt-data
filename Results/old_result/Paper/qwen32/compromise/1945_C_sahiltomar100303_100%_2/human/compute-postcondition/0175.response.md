Output State: **`left` is either 0 or not 0, `right` is either `n` or less than `n`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightOne` is 2, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is `mid`, and the character `s[i]` is not '0'**

Explanation: The value of `trightOne` is incremented by 1, so if it was previously 1, it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
