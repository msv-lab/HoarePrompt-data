Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 1`, `tleftZero` must be less than `(mid + 2) // 2`, `trightOne` must be less than `(n - mid) // 2`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `tleftOne` is increased by 1, `trightOne` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language: The values of `left`, `right`, `tleftZero`, `n`, and the condition that `tleftOne` is increased by 1 remain unchanged. The value of `trightOne` is decreased by 1.
