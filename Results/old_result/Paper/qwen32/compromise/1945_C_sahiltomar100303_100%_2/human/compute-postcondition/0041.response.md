The code snippet `trightOne += 1` increments the value of `trightOne` by 1. According to the initial state, `trightOne` is initially 1. After the increment, `trightOne` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `rightOne` is 1, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `trightOne` is 2, and `s[i]` is not '0'**
