The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `mid + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to `mid + 2`. The value of `n` remains the same as it is the upper bound of the range.

State: **`left` is either 0 or not 0, `right` is either `n` or less than `n`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is `mid + 2`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 2 and `trightZero` is 3. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightOne` is 3 and `trightOne` is 4**
