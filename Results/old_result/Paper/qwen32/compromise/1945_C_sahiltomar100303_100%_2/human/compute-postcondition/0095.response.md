The value of `tleftOne` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 1`, `tleftZero` must be less than `(mid + 2) // 2`, `trightOne` must be less than `(n - mid) // 2`, `n` is greater than `mid`, and `tleftOne` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 1`, `tleftZero` must be less than `(mid + 2) // 2`, `trightOne` must be less than `(n - mid) // 2`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `tleftOne` is increased by 1**.
