The code snippet `trightZero -= 1` decrements the value of `trightZero` by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `trightZero` is 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise 1.

After the decrement:
- If `s[right]` is '0', `trightZero` was initially 1 and becomes 0.
- If `s[right]` is not '0', `trightZero` was initially 1 and becomes 0.

Thus, the value of `trightZero` is now 0 regardless of the initial character at `s[right]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is -1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0; `rightOne` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `rightOne` is 1; `rightZero` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0'; `leftOne` is 0 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0'; `right` is 3; `n` must be greater than 4; `tleftZero` is 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise 0; `trightOne` is 1 if the character at index `right` of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise -1; `tleftOne` is 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', otherwise 0; `trightZero` is 0.**
