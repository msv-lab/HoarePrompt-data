Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, the input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (3 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses. The next line contains a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident wants to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident wants to live on the right side. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    mid = n // 2
    leftZero = 0
    rightZero = 0
    leftOne = 0
    rightOne = 0
    tleftZero = 0
    trightZero = 0
    tleftOne = 0
    trightOne = 0
    for i in range(mid):
        if s[i] == '0':
            leftZero += 1
            tleftZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne += 1
            tleftOne += 1
    for i in range(mid, n):
        if s[i] == '0':
            rightZero += 1
            trightZero += 1
        else:
            rightOne += 1
            trightOne += 1
    left = mid
    leftMove = 0
    while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left +
        1) // 2):
        if s[left - 1] == '0':
            leftZero -= 1
            rightZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne -= 1
            rightOne += 1
        left -= 1
    right = mid
    while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n -
        right + 1) // 2):
        if s[right] == '0':
            tleftZero += 1
            trightZero -= 1
        else:
            tleftOne += 1
            trightOne -= 1
        right += 1
    if left == 0:
        if right != n:
            print(right)
        elif rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(left)
        else:
            print(right)
    elif right == n:
        if left != 0:
            print(left)
        elif tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(right)
        else:
            print(left)
    elif abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right):
        print(left)
    else:
        print(right)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `left` is either 0 or not 0, `right` is either `n` or less than `n`, `tleftZero` is at least `(n + 1) // 2`, and `trightOne` is at least 0. If `left` is 0, then `right` can be either `n` or less than `n`, and `trightOne` is at least `(n + 1) // 2` if `right` is `n`; otherwise, `trightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `left` is not 0, then `right` can be either `n` or not equal to `n`, and if `right` is `n`, `left` remains unchanged; if `right` is not `n`, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `left` is 0 if the initial condition was `left == 0`, otherwise `left` is not 0. The values of `leftZero`, `rightOne`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, `tleftOne`, and `trightZero` remain unchanged from the precondition. If `right` is not equal to `n`, `right` remains 4. If `right` is equal to `n` and `left` is 0, `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2` based on the condition. If `right` equals `n` and `left` is not 0, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`. If `right` does not equal `n` and `left` is not 0, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `left` is 0 or not equal to 0, `s` remains "001011", `leftZero` is -2, `leftOne` is -1, `mid` is 3, `tleftOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 3, `rightOne` is 3, `trightZero` is 2, `trightOne` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is 6. If `right` is not equal to `n`, then `right` remains 6. If `right` is equal to `n`, then `rightOne` remains unchanged if it is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`; otherwise, it is less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `left` is not equal to 0 and `right` equals `n`, then `right` equals `n` and the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
