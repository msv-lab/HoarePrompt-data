The code snippet `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. Given the initial state, `tleftZero` was 3. After the increment, `tleftZero` becomes 4. No other variables are affected by this statement.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `left` is 0 if the initial condition was `left == 0`, otherwise `left` is not 0; `s` is the value of the user's input; `leftZero` is 3; `rightOne` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is `leftOne + 1` if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise it remains unchanged; `mid` must be greater than 0; `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero` remain unchanged; if `right` is not equal to `n`, `right` remains 4; if `right` equals `n` and `left` is 0, `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2` based on the condition; if `right` equals `n` and `left` is not 0, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`; if `right` does not equal `n` and `left` is not 0, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`; `tleftZero` is 4; `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1` if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise it remains unchanged; `trightOne` is 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `mid` remains unchanged. If `s[i]` is '0', `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are incremented by 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are incremented by 1; `i` is incremented by 1; `i` is `i + 1`.**
