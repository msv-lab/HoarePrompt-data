Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `right` is either `n` or less than `n`, `tleftZero` is at least `(n + 1) // 2`, and `trightOne` is at least 0. If `right` is not equal to `n`, then the current value of `right` is less than `n`. If `right` is equal to `n` and `trightOne` is at least `(n + 1) // 2`, then `trightOne` is at least `(n + 1) // 2`; otherwise, `trightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`.**
