The code snippet `b[x] += 1` increments the value of `b[x]` by 1. According to the initial state, `b[x]` was already incremented by 2, so this operation will further increase it by 1, making the total increment of `b[x]` equal to 3. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is `3 * a[x]`, `b` has incremented values at those indices with `b[x]` increased by 3, `t` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`, `i` is the third element in `s`.**
