The code snippet `r += a[x]` modifies the variable `r` by adding the value of `a[x]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `r` is initially `a[x]`. After the execution of the code, `r` becomes `a[x] + a[x]`, which simplifies to `2 * a[x]`.

Therefore, the updated output state is:
Output State: **`r` is `2 * a[x]`, `b` has incremented values at those indices with `b[x]` increased by 1, `t` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`, `i` is the next element in `s`**.
