`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `r`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`r` is a string formed by concatenating elements from `a` based on the indices of elements in `s` within `b`, `b` has incremented values at those indices, `t` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is an input integer**.
