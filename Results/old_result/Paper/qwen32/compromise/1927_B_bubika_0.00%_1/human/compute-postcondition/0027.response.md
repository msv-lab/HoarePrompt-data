The code snippet `b[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` in the list `b` by 1. Given that `x` is the index of `n` in `b`, the value of `b[x]` will increase by 1. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is `a[x]`, `b` has incremented values at those indices with `b[x]` increased by 1, `t` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the index of `n` in `b`.**
