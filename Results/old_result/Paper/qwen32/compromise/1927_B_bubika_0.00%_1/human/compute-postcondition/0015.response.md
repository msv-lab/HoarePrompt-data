The code `x = b.index(i)` assigns the value of the index of `i` in the list `b` to the variable `x`. The initial state specifies that `s` is unchanged and `i` is the next element in `s` after the current value of `i`. The value of `i` is used to find its index in the list `b`, and this index is stored in `x`. The values of `s` and `i` remain unchanged except for the new assignment to `x`.

Output State: **`s` is unchanged, `i` is the next element in `s` after the current value of `i`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`.**
