The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n`. For each test case, it prints 'NO' if `n` is 1, otherwise it prints 'YES' and a string consisting of `n` uppercase letters where each letter appears twice consecutively, except when `n` is odd, in which case the first three letters are 'AAA' followed by pairs of letters.
