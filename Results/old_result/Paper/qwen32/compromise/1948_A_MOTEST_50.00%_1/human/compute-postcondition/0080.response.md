The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends to the `ans` string by taking the character at index `x` from the string `s` and repeating it twice. Given `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' and `x` is 2, the character at index 2 is 'C'. Therefore, 'CC' will be appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 5, `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is 'AABBCC', `x` is 2, `j` is 2**.
