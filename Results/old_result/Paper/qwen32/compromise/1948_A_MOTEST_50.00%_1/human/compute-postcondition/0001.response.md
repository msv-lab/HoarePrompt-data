The code assigns the string of all uppercase ASCII letters to the variable `s`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the assignment to `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'**.
