The code snippet provided is `os.system('cls')`. This command is used to clear the screen in a Windows command prompt. It does not affect any variables or their values directly. Therefore, the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.**
