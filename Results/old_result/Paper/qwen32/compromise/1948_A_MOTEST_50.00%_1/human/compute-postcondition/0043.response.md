The code `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` of the string `s` repeated twice to the string `ans`. Given that `x` is 0, `s[x]` is 'A'. Therefore, 'A' repeated twice is 'AA', which is appended to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 'AA', `x` is 0**.
