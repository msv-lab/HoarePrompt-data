To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state:

1. `t` is greater than `i + 1` (This condition does not affect the value of `ans` directly).
2. `n` is an input integer, which can either be 6 or 7.
3. `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
4. `i` is `i + 1` (This operation does not affect the value of `ans` directly).
5. `ans` is either 'AABBCC' or 'AAABBCCDD', depending on the value of `n`.
6. `x` is either 3 or 4, depending on the value of `n`.

Given the conditions:
- If `n` is 6, `ans` is 'AABBCC' and `x` is 3.
- If `n` is 7, `ans` is 'AAABBCCDD' and `x` is 4.

Since the value of `n` is explicitly stated to be either 6 or 7, the value of `ans` will be either 'AABBCC' or 'AAABBCCDD'.

Thus, the `print(ans)` statement will print either 'AABBCC' or 'AAABBCCDD' based on the value of `n`.

Output: **ans (where ans is 'AABBCC' if n is 6, or 'AAABBCCDD' if n is 7)**
