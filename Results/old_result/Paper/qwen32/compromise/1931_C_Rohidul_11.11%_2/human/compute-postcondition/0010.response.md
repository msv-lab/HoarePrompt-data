The code snippet `st += 1` increments the value of `st` by 1. Given that the initial state specifies `st` is 1, after this operation, `st` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input such that `a[0] == a[1]` and `a[1] == a[2]`; `l` is 2; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 2; `end` is 0**.
