The code snippet `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Given that the initial value of `l` is 1, after this operation, `l` will be 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where `a[0] == a[1]` and `a[1] == a[2]`; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer and `n > 1`; `l` is 2; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 1; `end` is 0**.
