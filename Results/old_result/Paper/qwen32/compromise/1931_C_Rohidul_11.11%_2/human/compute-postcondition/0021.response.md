To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `r` and `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]`.

The loop condition is `r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]`. For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true:
1. `r > l`
2. `a[r] == a[r - 1]`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to its successor, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal.
- `r` is `l`.
- `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal.
- `end` is 2.
- `a[r] == a[r - 1]`

Since `r` is currently equal to `l`, the condition `r > l` is not satisfied, and thus the loop will not execute again. To make the loop execute one more time, `r` must be greater than `l`.

Here is the adjusted state:
- `r` must be greater than `l` to satisfy `r > l`.
- `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must still be true to satisfy the second part of the loop condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to its successor, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `r` is greater than `l`; `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `end` is 2; `a[r] == a[r - 1]`**
