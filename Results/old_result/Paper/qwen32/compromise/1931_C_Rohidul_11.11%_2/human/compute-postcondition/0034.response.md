Let's break down the given code and initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State and Variables
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable doesn't affect the output directly in the provided code snippet.
- `n` is an input integer representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to its successor, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal.
- `r` is the first index from the end where `a[r]` is not equal to `a[r - 1]`, or `l` if all elements from `l` to the end are equal.
- `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal.
- `end` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list until the first element that is not equal to its successor.
- `ans` is calculated based on the following conditions:
  - If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`.
  - Otherwise, if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.
  - Otherwise, `ans` is `r - l`.

### Calculation of Variables
1. **`l` Calculation**:
   - `l` is the first index where `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i + 1]`.
   - If all elements are equal, `l` is `n - 1`.

2. **`r` Calculation**:
   - `r` is the first index from the end where `a[r]` is not equal to `a[r - 1]`.
   - If all elements from `l` to the end are equal, `r` is `l`.

3. **`st` Calculation**:
   - `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element.
   - If all elements are equal, `st` is `n - 1`.

4. **`end` Calculation**:
   - `end` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list until the first element that is not equal to its successor.

5. **`ans` Calculation**:
   - If `a[0] == a[n - 1]`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`.
   - If `st == 0` and `end == 0`, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` is `r - l`.

### Final Output Calculation
The `print` statement is `print(max(0, ans))`. This means the output will be the maximum of 0 and the calculated `ans`.

### Explanation of Output
- If `ans` is negative, the output will be 0.
- Otherwise, the output will be the value of `ans`.

### Conclusion
Given the initial state and the calculations, the output will be the value of `ans` if it is non-negative, or 0 if `ans` is negative.

Output: **max(0, ans) (where ans is calculated based on the conditions provided)**
