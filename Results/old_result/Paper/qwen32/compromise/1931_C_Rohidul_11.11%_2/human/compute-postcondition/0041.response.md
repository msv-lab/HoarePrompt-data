Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0] == a[1]`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 0, `end` is 0, `ans` is `r - l - 1` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`, otherwise `ans` is `r - l`.**

The value of `l` is incremented by 1, making `l` equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
