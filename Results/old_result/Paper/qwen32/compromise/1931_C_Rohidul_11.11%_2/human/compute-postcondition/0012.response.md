The value of `l` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `l` is 2, after the execution of `l += 1`, the value of `l` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input such that `a[0] == a[1]`, `a[1] == a[2]`, and `a[2] == a[3]`; `l` is 3; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 2; `end` is 0**
