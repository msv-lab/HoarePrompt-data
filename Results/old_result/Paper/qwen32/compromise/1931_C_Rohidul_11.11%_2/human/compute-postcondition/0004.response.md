The code snippet provided initializes two variables, `st` and `end`, both to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 0; `end` is 0.**
