The code snippet `st += 1` increments the value of `st` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial value of `st` is 0, after the increment, `st` becomes 1. The value of `ans` remains as per the initial conditions because the increment of `st` does not directly affect its calculation in the given context.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input where `a[0] == a[1]`; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer and `n > 1`; `l` is 1; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 1; `end` is 0; If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0; otherwise, `ans` is `r - l`.**
