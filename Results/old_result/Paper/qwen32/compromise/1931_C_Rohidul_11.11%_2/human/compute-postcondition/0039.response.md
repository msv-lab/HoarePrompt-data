The code snippet provided resets the values of `st` and `end` to 0. The initial values of `st` and `end` are not specified in the initial state, but the code explicitly sets them to 0. Therefore, the values of `st` and `end` are updated, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 0; `end` is 0; `ans` is `r - l - 1` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`, otherwise `ans` is `r - l`.**
