Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of integers and a set of queries. Each query specifies a range within the list. The function calculates the cumulative sum of the list and checks if the sum of the specified range meets a certain condition. It then prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on this condition.**
