The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and constructs a new list `a` where the first element is `0` and the subsequent elements are the integers from the input. This means the length of the list `a` will be `n + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers read from input where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 <= c_i <= 10^9; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n; The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5 and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first element is `0` and the next `n` elements are the integers read from the input.**
