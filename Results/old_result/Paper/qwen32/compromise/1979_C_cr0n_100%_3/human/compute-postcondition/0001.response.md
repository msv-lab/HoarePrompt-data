The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `vals`. The initial state specifies that `N` is an integer input by the user and `vals` is a list of integers where each element is a multiplier (k_i) for the corresponding outcome such that 2 <= k_i <= 20. 

After executing the code, `vals` will be updated to contain the integers from the input. The value of `N` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`N` is the integer value input by the user, `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input where each element is a multiplier (k_i) such that 2 <= k_i <= 20.**
