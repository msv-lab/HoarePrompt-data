### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided functions to determine if the program is correct.

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to distribute a certain amount of coins (`x_1, x_2, ..., x_n`) on `n` outcomes.
   - If the `i-th` outcome is the winning one, we receive `k_i * x_i` coins.
   - The sum of all bets (`x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n`) must be strictly less than `k_i * x_i` for any `i`.

2. **Approach:**
   - The key idea is to find a set of bets such that the sum of all bets is less than the return for any single winning outcome.
   - The function `func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers, which is used in `func_2` to find a common denominator for the multipliers.

3. **Execution Summary of `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` reads the number of outcomes `N` and the list of multipliers `vals`.
   - It calculates the LCM of all multipliers and stores it in `den`.
   - It then creates a list `vprod` where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding multiplier in `vals`.
   - The sum of `vprod` is subtracted from `den`. If the result is less than or equal to zero, it means no valid distribution is possible, and `-1` is printed.
   - Otherwise, the elements of `vprod` are printed as the bets.

4. **Verification:**
   - Let's consider the example provided in the problem:
     - For the first test case with multipliers `[3, 2, 7]`:
       - The LCM of `3`, `2`, and `7` is `42`.
       - `vprod` would be `[42/3, 42/2, 42/7] = [14, 21, 6]`.
       - The sum of `vprod` is `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`.
       - Adjusted `den` is `42 - 41 = 1`, which is greater than zero.
       - The bets `[14, 21, 6]` are valid because:
         - If the first outcome wins, we receive `3 * 14 = 42` coins.
         - If the second outcome wins, we receive `2 * 21 = 42` coins.
         - If the third outcome wins, we receive `7 * 6 = 42` coins.
         - In all cases, the return is strictly greater than the total bet (`41`).

   - The function correctly handles the cases where no valid distribution is possible by returning `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions together meet the problem description and correctly solve the problem. Thus, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
