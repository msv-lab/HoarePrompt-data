### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. We need to find an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted.
2. If `k == n`, it means all cyclic shifts of the array should be sorted. The simplest array that satisfies this is an array of all identical elements, e.g., `[1, 1, ..., 1]`.
3. If `k == 1`, it means only one cyclic shift should be sorted. A good example is an array that is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing except for one element that breaks the order, e.g., `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` is strictly increasing, and only the first cyclic shift `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` is sorted.
4. If `k` is neither `n` nor `1`, it is not possible to construct such an array with the given constraints. This is because if there is more than one sorted cyclic shift but not all of them, it becomes very restrictive to arrange the elements in a way that exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted while the rest are not, especially given the constraints `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3`.

#### Program Analysis:
The program correctly handles the three scenarios described above:
- If `k == n`, it outputs an array of `n` ones, which satisfies the condition that all cyclic shifts are sorted.
- If `k == 1`, it outputs an array that is a range from `0` to `n-1`, which satisfies the condition that only the first cyclic shift is sorted.
- If `k` is neither `n` nor `1`, it outputs `-1`, indicating that it is not possible to construct such an array.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the output for each test case based on the problem's constraints and requirements.

### Correctness:
