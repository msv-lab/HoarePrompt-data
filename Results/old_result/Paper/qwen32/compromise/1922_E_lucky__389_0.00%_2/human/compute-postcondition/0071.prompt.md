You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18.
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is 0; `subseq_lens` contains the sequence of powers of 2 that were subtracted from `X-1` in descending order; `mx` is the largest power of 2 that was used in the process.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains the sequence of powers of 2 that were subtracted from `X-1` in descending order, `mx` is the largest power of 2 that was used in the process, and `ansv` is a list consisting of all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first element.
    #
    #Output State:
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: len(ansv) (where len(ansv) is one less than the number of powers of 2 required to sum up to X-1)
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains the sequence of powers of 2 that were subtracted from `X-1` in descending order, `mx` is the largest power of 2 that was used in the process, `ansv` is a list consisting of all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first element, and `i` is `len(ansv) - 1`. The output will be the elements of `ansv` printed in order, separated by spaces.
    print()
    #This is printed: (newline)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, it receives an integer `X` such that 2 <= X <= 10^18. The function returns the result for each test case based on the value of `X`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
