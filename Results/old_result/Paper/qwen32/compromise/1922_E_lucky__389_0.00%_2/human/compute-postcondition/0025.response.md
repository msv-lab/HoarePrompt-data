The code snippet provided increments the value of `i` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `X`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `i` which was initially 1, will now be 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is at least 3; `subseq_lens` is an empty list or contains the integer 59; `mx` is 0 or 59; `i` is 2**.
