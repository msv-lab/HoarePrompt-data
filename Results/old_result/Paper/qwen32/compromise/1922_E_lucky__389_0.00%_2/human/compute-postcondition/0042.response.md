To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the next iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition and the relevant variables.

The `while` loop condition is:
```
while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This condition checks if \(2^{(i + 1)}\) is less than or equal to \(x + 1\). To ensure the loop can execute one more time, this condition must be satisfied.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\),
- For each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that \(2 \leq X \leq 10^{18}\),
- `x` is at least \(2^{58}\),
- `subseq_lens` is an empty list or contains the integer 59,
- `mx` is 0 or 59,
- `i` is incremented by 1.

We need to adjust `i` and `x` to ensure that the condition \(2^{(i + 1)} \leq x + 1\) holds true.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State of `i`**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration.
   - Assume `i` is currently \(i_{\text{current}}\).

2. **Current State of `x`**:
   - `x` is at least \(2^{58}\).
   - For the loop to execute again, \(2^{(i_{\text{current}} + 1) + 1} \leq x + 1\) must be true.
   - Simplifying, \(2^{(i_{\text{current}} + 2)} \leq x + 1\).

3. **Adjusting `x`**:
   - If \(x\) is currently \(2^{58}\), then for the next iteration, \(x\) must be such that \(2^{(i_{\text{current}} + 2)} \leq 2^{58} + 1\).
   - To ensure this holds true, \(x\) should be at least \(2^{(i_{\text{current}} + 2)} - 1\).

4. **Final State**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, the next value of `i` will be \(i_{\text{current}} + 1\).
   - Adjust `x` to be at least \(2^{(i_{\text{current}} + 2)} - 1\).

Given that we do not know the exact current value of `i`, we can represent the state as:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `x` must be at least \(2^{(i + 2)} - 1\).

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is at least \(2^{(i + 2)} - 1\); `subseq_lens` is an empty list or contains the integer 59; `mx` is 0 or 59; `i` is incremented by 1**.
