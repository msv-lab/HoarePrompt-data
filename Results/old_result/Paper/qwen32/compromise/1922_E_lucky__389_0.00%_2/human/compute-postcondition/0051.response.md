Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is at least 2^58 if `i` is not 0, otherwise the most internal loop or if statement is broken; `subseq_lens` is an empty list or contains the integer 59 if `i` is not 0, otherwise it contains the integer 58; `mx` is 0 or 59 if `i` is not 0, otherwise it is 59; `i` is 58 and not equal to 0 unless the most internal loop or if statement is broken in which case `i` is 0.**
