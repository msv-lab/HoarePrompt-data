The code snippet provided only increments the value of `i` by 1. Therefore, `i` will be increased by 1 from its initial value. The other variables (`t`, `X`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is at least \(2^{(i + 1)} - 1\); `subseq_lens` is an empty list or contains the integer 59; `mx` is 0 or 59; `i` is incremented by 1.**
