The code provided initializes an empty list `subseq_lens` and decrements the value of `x` by 1. The values of `t` and `X` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is `x - 1`; `subseq_lens` is an empty list.**
