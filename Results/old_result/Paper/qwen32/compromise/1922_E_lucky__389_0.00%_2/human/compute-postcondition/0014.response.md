Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is at least 1; `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is 0; `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
