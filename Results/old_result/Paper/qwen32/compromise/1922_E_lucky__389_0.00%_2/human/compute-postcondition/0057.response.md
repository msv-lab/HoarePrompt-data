Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains the sequence of powers of 2 that were subtracted from `X-1` in descending order and must contain at least two elements, `mx` is the largest power of 2 that was used in the process, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` with an additional element `subseq_lens[i]` appended to it, `i` is 1 + the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `ansv` now includes an additional element, which is `subseq_lens[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
