Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is at least 1 minus \(2^{59} - 1\); `subseq_lens` is an empty list or contains the integer 59; `mx` is 0 or 59; `i` is 59. If `i` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `subseq_lens` contains the integer 59, `mx` is 59, and `i` remains 59.**
