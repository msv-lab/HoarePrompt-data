Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` must be at least 7; `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is 0; `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
