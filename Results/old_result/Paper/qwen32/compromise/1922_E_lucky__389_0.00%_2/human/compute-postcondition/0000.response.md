The code snippet `x = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `x`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer within the range 2 to 10^18. Since the code only affects the variable `x`, the value of `t` and the condition for `X` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is an input integer.**
