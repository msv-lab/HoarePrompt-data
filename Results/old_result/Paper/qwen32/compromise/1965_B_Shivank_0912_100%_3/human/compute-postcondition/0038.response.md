The given Python code appends `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `tc` is incremented by 1.
- `t` remains the same.
- The list contains `[k - (1 << i_final), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i_final), 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(i_final - 1), 2^(i_final + 1), ..., 524288]`.
- `i` is `i_final` where `i_final` is the largest integer such that `2^(i_final + 1) <= k`.
- `ans` is initially `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` and now includes an additional element `1 << j`.
- `j` is not equal to `i`.

Therefore, the new state of `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j]`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `tc` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, the list contains `[k - (1 << i_final), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i_final), 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(i_final - 1), 2^(i_final + 1), ..., 524288]`, `i` is `i_final` where `i_final` is the largest integer such that `2^(i_final + 1) <= k`, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j]`, and `j` is not equal to `i`.**
