To determine the final output state after all 20 iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the list `ans` evolves with each iteration. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to 19, and for each `j`, it checks if `j` is not equal to `i`. If `j` is not equal to `i`, it appends `1 << j` (which is \(2^j\)) to the list `ans`.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `ans` starts as `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `j` from 0 to 19, if `j` is not equal to `i`, `1 << j` is appended to `ans`.
   - This means that for `j = 0` to `j = 19`, except when `j = i`, `1 << j` will be added to `ans`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After 20 iterations, `ans` will contain the initial three elements plus `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19 except `i`.

Therefore, the final `ans` list will be:
- The initial three elements: `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`
- Followed by `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19 except `i`.

In natural language, this means the final list will start with the three initial values and then include all powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{19}\) except \(2^i\).

Output State: **[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(i-1), 2^(i+1), ..., 524288]**
