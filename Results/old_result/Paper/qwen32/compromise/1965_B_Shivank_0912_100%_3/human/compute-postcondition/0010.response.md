To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the condition under which the loop terminates. The loop increments `i` as long as `1 << (i + 1)` (which is equivalent to \(2^{i+1}\)) is less than or equal to `k`.

Let's break down the loop iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `i` becomes 1, so `1 << (1 + 1) = 4` must be less than or equal to `k`.
- After 2 iterations: `i` becomes 2, so `1 << (2 + 1) = 8` must be less than or equal to `k`.
- After 3 iterations: `i` becomes 3, so `1 << (3 + 1) = 16` must be less than or equal to `k`.

The loop will continue until `1 << (i + 1)` exceeds `k`. Therefore, the final value of `i` will be the largest integer such that `2^{i+1} <= k`.

If we denote the maximum `i` that satisfies this condition as `i_max`, then `2^{i_max + 1} <= k < 2^{i_max + 2}`.

Thus, the final state of `i` will be `i_max`.

**Output State:** **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an integer read from the input; `k` is an integer read from the input; `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\).**

In simpler terms, `i` will be the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`, minus one.
