Postcondition: **`ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` if `j + 1` equals `i` after the if-else block. Otherwise, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << (j + 1), 1 << (j + 2), 1 << (j + 1)]` if `j + 1` did not equal `i` initially, or `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << (j + 1)]` if `j + 1` equals `i` initially. `j` is incremented by 1 if `j` was not equal to `i` initially.**
