The code appends `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `j` is `i_final + 1`. Therefore, `1 << j` is `2^(i_final + 1)`.

The list `ans` initially contains `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`. After appending `1 << j`, the new list `ans` will be `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 2^(i_final + 1)]`.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `tc` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, the list contains `[k - (1 << i_final), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i_final), 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(i_final - 1), 2^(i_final + 1), ..., 524288]`, `i` is `i_final` where `i_final` is the largest integer such that `2^(i_final + 1) <= k`, `j` is `i_final + 1`, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 2^(i_final + 1)]`.**
