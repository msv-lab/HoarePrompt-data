The code appends `1 << j` to the list `ans`. This means that the list `ans` now includes an additional element which is `2` raised to the power of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `t` remains the same, `i` is `i_final` where `1 << (i_final + 1)` is the smallest power of 2 greater than `k`, `ans` is updated to include `1 << j`, `j` is `j + 1`**.
