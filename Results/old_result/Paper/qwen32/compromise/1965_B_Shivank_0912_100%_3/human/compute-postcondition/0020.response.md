The code appends `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `j` is incremented by 1 before this operation. Therefore, the new element appended to `ans` is `1 << (j + 1)`.

If `j + 1` equals `i`, `ans` initially contains `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`. After appending `1 << (j + 1)`, `ans` becomes `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << (j + 1)]`.

If `j + 1` does not equal `i`, `ans` initially contains `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << (j + 1), 1 << (j + 2)]`. After appending `1 << (j + 1)`, `ans` becomes `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << (j + 1), 1 << (j + 2), 1 << (j + 1)]`.

However, since `j` is incremented by 1 before the append operation, the correct interpretation is that `1 << (j + 1)` is appended in both cases, and `j` is already incremented.

Thus, the final state of `ans` is:
- If `j + 1` equals `i`, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << (j + 1)]`.
- If `j + 1` does not equal `i`, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << (j + 1), 1 << (j + 2), 1 << (j + 1)]`.

Since `j` is incremented by 1 before the append operation, the condition `j + 1` equals `i` is no longer relevant for the final state of `ans`.

Output State: **`ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << (j + 1), 1 << (j + 2), 1 << (j + 1)]` if `j + 1` did not equal `i` initially; otherwise, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << (j + 1)]`. `j` is incremented by 1.**
