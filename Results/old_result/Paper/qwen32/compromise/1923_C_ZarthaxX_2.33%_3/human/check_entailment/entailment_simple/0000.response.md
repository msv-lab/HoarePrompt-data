### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if a subarray can be transformed into another array `b` such that the sum of `b` is the same as the sum of the subarray, all elements of `b` are positive, and no element of `b` is equal to the corresponding element in the subarray.

The provided program computes cumulative counts and sums to efficiently answer multiple queries. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Cumulative Counts and Sums**:
   - `ones[i]` stores the cumulative count of 1s up to index `i-1` in the subarray.
   - `sum[i]` stores the cumulative sum of elements up to index `i-1` in the subarray, but each element is decreased by 1. This means `sum[i]` effectively counts how much the sum of the subarray would decrease if all elements were reduced by 1.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the number of 1s in the subarray (`onesInRange`) and the adjusted sum of the subarray (`sumInRange`).
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is checked to determine if the subarray can be transformed into a valid `b` array:
     - `2 * onesInRange` accounts for the fact that each 1 in the subarray must be increased to at least 2.
     - `(r - l + 1) - onesInRange` accounts for the remaining elements that need to be increased by at least 1.
     - `sumInRange` is the total amount by which the subarray sum can be decreased if all elements were reduced by 1.
     - If the total increase needed (`2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange`) is less than or equal to the total decrease possible (`sumInRange`), the subarray can be transformed into a valid `b` array.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the subarray has only one element (`l == r`), it is impossible to create a valid `b` array because `b_i` must be different from `a_i` and `b_i > 0`.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly determines whether each subarray can be transformed into a valid `b` array according to the problem's constraints.
