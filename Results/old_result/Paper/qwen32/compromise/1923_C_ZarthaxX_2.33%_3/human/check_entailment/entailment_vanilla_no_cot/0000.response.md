Let's analyze the given program and determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine if a subarray `c[l_i...r_i]` is "good".
- A subarray is "good" if there exists an array `b` such that:
  1. The sum of elements in `c[l_i...r_i]` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
  2. Each element `c[j]` in the subarray is different from `b[j]`.
  3. Each element `b[j]` is greater than 0.

### Key Observations:
- For a subarray to be "good", the sum of the subarray minus the number of 1s in the subarray must be non-negative. This is because:
  - If `c[j]` is greater than 1, we can set `b[j]` to `c[j] - 1`, which is still greater than 0.
  - If `c[j]` is 1, we need to decrease it, but we can't set `b[j]` to 0, so we need another element in the subarray to increase its value to compensate.
- The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` can be simplified to `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange`, which means the number of non-1 elements plus the number of 1s should be less than or equal to the sum of the subarray minus the number of 1s.

### Program Analysis:
- The program initializes two arrays `ones` and `sum` to keep track of the number of 1s and the sum of elements (minus 1 for each element) up to each index.
- For each query, it calculates the number of 1s and the adjusted sum for the subarray `c[l_i...r_i]`.
- It then checks if the condition `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange` holds.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions.
