To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if it correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" according to the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Sum Condition**: The sum of array `a` should be equal to the sum of array `b`.
2. **Difference Condition**: Each element of array `a` should be different from the corresponding element of array `b`.
3. **Positive Condition**: Each element of array `b` should be positive.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an array `c` and a series of queries. Each query specifies a subarray, and the program needs to determine if this subarray is "good".

The program uses two auxiliary arrays:
- `ones`: This array keeps track of the cumulative count of elements equal to 1 in the array `c`.
- `sum`: This array keeps track of the cumulative sum of the array `c` minus the number of elements (which is equivalent to the cumulative sum of `c[i] - 1`).

For each query, the program calculates:
- `onesInRange`: The number of elements equal to 1 within the specified subarray.
- `sumInRange`: The sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray.

The key condition checked is:
```
2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange
```
This can be simplified to:
```
onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange
```
Let's break down why this condition works:
- `onesInRange` is the number of 1s in the subarray.
- `(r - l + 1)` is the length of the subarray.
- `sumInRange` is the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements.

For the subarray to be "good":
1. If there are any 1s in the subarray, they can be changed to 2s (since 2 > 1 and 2 â‰  1).
2. For other elements, we need to ensure that we can change them to a different positive integer while maintaining the sum.

The condition `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange` ensures that:
- The sum of the subarray minus the number of elements is at least as large as the number of elements.
- This allows us to change each 1 to 2 and other elements to a different positive integer while keeping the sum unchanged.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. It efficiently computes the necessary values using prefix sums and checks the condition for each query.

Correctness: **True**
