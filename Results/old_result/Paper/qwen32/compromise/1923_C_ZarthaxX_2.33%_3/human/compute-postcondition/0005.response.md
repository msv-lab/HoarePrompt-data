To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the `ones` and `sum` lists are updated in each iteration.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `ones` is initialized as a list of `n + 1` zeros.
   - `sum` is initialized as a list of `n + 1` zeros.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
   - For each `i`, `ones[i]` is updated to be the value of `ones[i - 1]` plus 1 if `nums[i - 1]` is 1, otherwise it remains the same as `ones[i - 1]`.
   - `sum[i]` is updated to be the value of `sum[i - 1]` plus `nums[i - 1] - 1`.

3. **Final Output State:**
   - `ones[i]` will hold the cumulative count of 1s in the `nums` list up to the `i-1` index.
   - `sum[i]` will hold the cumulative sum of `nums` list up to the `i-1` index, with each element decreased by 1.

Let's formalize this understanding in the output state format:

Output State: **`ones` is a list where `ones[i]` is the number of 1s in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`. `sum` is a list where `sum[i]` is the sum of `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, with each element decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.**
