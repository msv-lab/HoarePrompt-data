Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `q`, a list `c` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query is defined by a pair of integers `l_i` and `r_i`. The function processes these queries and returns the result for each query.**
