To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to consider the changes made to the variables `ones` and `sum` within the loop. However, the provided loop does not modify the `ones` and `sum` arrays directly. Instead, it uses these arrays to compute values for each query and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on a condition.

Since the `ones` and `sum` arrays are not being updated within the loop, their states remain the same as the initial state. The only changes occur in the output (i.e., the printed results), but these do not affect the state of the variables `ones` and `sum`.

Therefore, the output state of the variables `ones` and `sum` remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`ones[i]` will hold the cumulative count of 1s in the `nums` list up to the `i-1` index. `sum[i]` will hold the cumulative sum of `nums` list up to the `i-1` index, with each element decreased by 1.**
