You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each of the following t test cases consists of three integers n, a, and b such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
        
    #State: The output state consists of `t` lines, each representing the result of the expression evaluated for each set of `n`, `a`, and `b` read from the input. Specifically, for each iteration, if `b <= a`, the result is `n * a`. If `b - a >= n`, the result is the integer value of `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`. Otherwise, the result is the integer value of `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` from the initial state remain unchanged except that `t` iterations of the loop have been executed, and the results have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It returns the result of some computation or comparison based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
