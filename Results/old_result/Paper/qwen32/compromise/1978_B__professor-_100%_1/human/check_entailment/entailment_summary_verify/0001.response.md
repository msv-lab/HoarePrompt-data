### Reasoning

To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's systematically analyze the logic and compare it with the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Analysis

The problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling `n` buns under specific pricing rules:
- The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
- For the first `k` buns, the price of the `i-th` bun is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
- The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at `a` coins each.

We need to maximize the profit by choosing an optimal `k`.

#### Program Analysis

The program divides the problem into three cases based on the relationship between `a` and `b`:

1. **Case 1: `b <= a`**
   - Selling all buns at the usual price `a` results in the maximum profit.
   - The profit is `n * a`.

2. **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
   - Selling all buns at the modified price results in the maximum profit.
   - The sum of the first `n` terms of the sequence `(b, b-1, ..., b-n+1)` can be calculated using the arithmetic series sum formula: `((2 * b - n + 1) * n) // 2`.

3. **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
   - Selling `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a` results in the maximum profit.
   - The optimal `k` is `b - a` because beyond this point, the price of the bun `(b - i + 1)` will be less than or equal to `a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the modified price sequence plus the profit from selling the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`.
   - The sum of the first `b - a` terms of the modified price sequence is `((b - a) * (b - a + 1)) // 2`.
   - The profit from selling the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a` is `a * (n - (b - a))`.

The program correctly implements these cases and should produce the correct output for the given problem.

#### Function Summary and Program Code

The function summary accurately describes the logic implemented in the program:
- When `b <= a`, the profit is `n * a`.
- When `b - a >= n`, the profit is `((2 * b - n + 1) * n) // 2`.
- When `b - a < n`, the profit is `((b - a) * (b - a + 1)) // 2 + a * (n - (b - a))`.

The program code aligns with these descriptions and handles all edge cases correctly.

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules.

**Final: True**
