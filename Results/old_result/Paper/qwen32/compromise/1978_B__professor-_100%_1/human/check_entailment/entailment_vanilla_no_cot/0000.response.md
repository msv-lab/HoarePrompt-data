Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum profit in all cases. Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Case 1: `b <= a`**
   - The program correctly calculates the profit as `n * a` since selling all buns at the usual price is optimal.

2. **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
   - The program calculates the profit as `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`, which is the sum of the first `n` terms of the sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time. This is correct for the scenario where all buns can be sold at the decreasing price.

3. **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
   - The program calculates the profit as `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`. However, this is incorrect. The program should calculate the profit by considering the maximum `k` such that the price of the `k`-th bun is still greater than `a`. This `k` is `b - a + 1` (or `n` if `b - a + 1 > n`). The profit should be the sum of the first `k` terms of the sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1, plus the profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.

The correct implementation should be:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            profit_from_k_buns = (b + (b - k + 1)) * k // 2
            profit_from_remaining_buns = (n - k) * a
            print(profit_from_k_buns + profit_from_remaining_buns)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum profit by considering the optimal `k` and summing the profits from both the discounted and usual price buns.
