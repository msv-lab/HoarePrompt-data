### Reasoning:

The program aims to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Case 1: `b <= a`**
   - If the price of the first bun (`b`) is less than or equal to the usual price (`a`), it makes no sense to sell any bun at a modified price because doing so would not yield more profit than selling all buns at the usual price. Therefore, the maximum profit is simply `n * a`.

2. **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
   - If the difference between the price of the first bun (`b`) and the usual price (`a`) is greater than or equal to the total number of buns (`n`), Bob should sell all buns at the modified price. The prices of the buns will be `b, b-1, b-2, ..., b-(n-1)`. The sum of these prices can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \((2b - n + 1) \times n / 2\).

3. **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
   - If the difference between the price of the first bun (`b`) and the usual price (`a`) is less than the total number of buns (`n`), Bob should sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price. The sum of the prices for the first `b - a` buns is \((b - a) \times (b - a + 1) / 2\), and the sum of the prices for the remaining buns is \((n - (b - a)) \times a\). Therefore, the total profit is \((b - a) \times (b - a + 1) / 2 + a \times n\).

The program correctly implements these three cases based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
