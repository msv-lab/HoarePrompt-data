Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` remains the same; `k` remains the same; `res` contains up to `k` elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` if `k` is non-zero; `i` has gone through all values in `res`; `ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` was true, multiplied by 2; `a` remains the same; `l` reflects the counts of each element in `a`; `r` remains the same; `re` is equal to `k` if `k` is non-zero; `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `res` contains up to `k` elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` if `k` is non-zero, `i` is `n`, `ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` was true, multiplied by 2, `a` remains the same, `l` reflects the counts of each element in `a`, `r` remains the same, `re` is equal to `k` if `k` is non-zero. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no else part to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `res` contains up to `k` elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` if `k` is non-zero, `i` is `n + 1`, `ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` was true, multiplied by 2, `a` remains the same, `l` reflects the counts of each element in `a`, `r` remains the same, `re` is equal to `k` if `k` is non-zero. If `ul == ur`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `res` contains up to `k` elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` if `k` is non-zero, `i` is `n + 2`, `ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` was true, multiplied by 2, `a` remains the same, `l` reflects the counts of each element in `a`, `r` remains the same, `re` is equal to `k` if `k` is non-zero. If `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, then `ur` is incremented by 2. If `ul == ur`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
