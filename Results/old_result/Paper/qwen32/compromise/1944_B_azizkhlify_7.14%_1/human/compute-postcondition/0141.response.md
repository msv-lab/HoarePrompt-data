Output State: **`t` is a variable, `ul` is either `k * 2 + 4` or `k * 2 + 2` if `l[a[i] - 1] == 2`, otherwise `ul` remains `k * 2 + 2` or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `n` is 2, `k` is the second input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `l` is a list of 2 elements where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of the integer `j+1` in the list `a`, `r` is [0, 1], `re` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
