To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the context in which the print statement is executed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `n` remains the same: This indicates the total number of elements in the list `a`.
- `k` remains the same: This is some integer value.
- `res` contains at least one element from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` if `k` is non-zero: `res` is a list that includes elements from `a` where the corresponding count in `l` is 1.
- `i` has gone through all values from `0` to `n-1`: This indicates that `i` has iterated over the entire range of indices of the list `a`.
- `ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` was true, multiplied by 2: This is a count related to elements in `a` that appear exactly twice, multiplied by 2.
- `a` remains the same: This is the list of elements.
- `l` reflects the counts of each element in `a`: This is a list where `l[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x+1` in `a`.
- `r` remains the same: This indicates some value or list, but its specific use is not described.
- `re` is equal to `k` if `k` is non-zero: This is a variable that holds the value of `k` if `k` is non-zero.

### Analysis:
The print statement `print(i, end=' ')` will print the value of the variable `i` followed by a space, and it will not move to a new line after printing. Given that `i` has gone through all values from `0` to `n-1`, the print statement will execute once for each value of `i` in this range.

### Output:
Since `i` has gone through all values from `0` to `n-1`, the print statement will print each of these values in sequence, separated by spaces. Therefore, the output will be a sequence of numbers from `0` to `n-1`, all on the same line.

Output: **0 1 2 ... n-1**
