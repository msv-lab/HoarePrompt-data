Postcondition: **`t` is a variable, `ul` is either `k * 2` or 0, `ur` is 0, `n` is 2, `k` is the second input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `l` is a list of 2 elements where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of the integer `j+1` in the list `a`, `r` is [0, 1], `re` is 0, `res` is an empty list. If `ul` is `k * 2`, then the if block is executed; otherwise, the else part (which is empty) is taken.**
