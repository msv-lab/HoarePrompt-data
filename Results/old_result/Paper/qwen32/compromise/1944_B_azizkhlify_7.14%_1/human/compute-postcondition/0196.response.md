To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`res`**: It's a list with at least one element.
2. **`i`**: It is defined as the last element of `res` plus 2.
3. **`n`**: It is a non-negative integer.
4. **`ul` and `ur`**: Their relationship depends on the condition `ul == ur`. If initially `ul == ur`, then `ul` remains equal to `ur`. Otherwise, `ul` is not equal to `ur`. There's a condition within the loop or statement that modifies `ur` if `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, but this doesn't affect the current value of `a[i]` directly.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```
- The `print` statement is printing the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and not followed by a newline (`end=' '`).

### Key Variables:
- **`a[i]`**: This is the value at index `i` of the list `a`. The value of `i` is the last element of `res` plus 2.

### Determining the Output:
- **`i`**: Since `i` is the last element of `res` plus 2, we need to know the value of the last element of `res` to determine `i`.
- **`a[i]`**: This depends on the value of `i` and the contents of the list `a`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, we know the value of `i` is the last element of `res` plus 2, but we don't have the specific values of `res` or `a`. Therefore, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `a[i]`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the variables provided.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[i] a[i] (where i is the last element of res plus 2)**
