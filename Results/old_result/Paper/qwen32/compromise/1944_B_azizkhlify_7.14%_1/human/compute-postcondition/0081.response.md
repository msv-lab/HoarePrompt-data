To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and the print statement itself.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **Variables Defined:**
   - `t`, `ul`, `ur`: These variables are defined, but their specific values are not provided. We only know that `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
   - `n`: This variable is at least 1.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]`: This expression is equal to 2. This tells us that the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` is 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`: This statement prints the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and does not add a newline at the end.

### Key Points:
- The value of `a[i]` is not directly provided, but we know that `r[a[i] - 1] = 2`. This means that `a[i] - 1` is an index in the list `r` where the value is 2.
- Since `a[i] - 1` is an index, `a[i]` must be an integer that, when decremented by 1, points to a valid index in the list `r`.

### Output Derivation:
- The print statement prints `a[i]` twice. Since the exact value of `a[i]` is not specified, we can only say that `a[i]` is an integer that satisfies the condition `r[a[i] - 1] = 2`.
- The print statement does not include any additional formatting or conditions that would alter the output beyond printing `a[i]` twice.

### Final Output:
Given the information, the output will be the value of `a[i]` printed twice, separated by a space, and no newline at the end.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is an integer such that r[a[i] - 1] = 2)**
