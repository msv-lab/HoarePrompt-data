The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last element of `res`, and `n` is a non-negative integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it should still be less than `2 * n`.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`res` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the last element of `res` plus 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `ul` is equal to `ur` if `ul` was originally equal to `ur`. Otherwise, `ul` is not equal to `ur`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `ul` is not equal to the new value of `ur` (which is `ur + 2`).**
