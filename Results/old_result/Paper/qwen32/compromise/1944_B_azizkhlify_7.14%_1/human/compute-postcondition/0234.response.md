To determine the output of the print statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- There is an array or list `a` (which is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we can infer it must exist since it is being accessed in the print statement).

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Given that `i` is 1, the print statement will output the element at index 1 of the list `a` twice, followed by a space (because of the `end=' '` parameter).

Since the list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact numerical values. However, we can describe the output in terms of the elements of the list `a`.

The element at index 1 of the list `a` will be printed twice. Let's denote this element as `a[1]`.

Output: **a[1] a[1] (where a[1] is the element at index 1 of the list `a`)**
