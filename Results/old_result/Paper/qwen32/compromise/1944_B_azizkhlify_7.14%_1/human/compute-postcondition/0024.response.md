To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State Summary:
- `t`: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000 (not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `n`: An integer such that n >= 1.
- `k`: The second integer from the input.
- `a`: A list of integers.
- `l`: A list where the i-th element is the count of occurrences of integer i+1 in the list `a`.
- `r`: A list of `n` integers.
- `re`, `ul`, `ur`: All initialized to 0.
- `res`: An empty list.
- The i-th element of `a` satisfies `l[a[i] - 1] == 2`.

### Key Points:
- The `print` statement is `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.
- The `end=' '` argument means that the output will be followed by a space instead of a newline.
- `a[i]` is printed twice.

### Analysis:
- The condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` tells us that the element `a[i]` appears exactly twice in the list `a`.
- We need to determine the value of `a[i]` to know what will be printed.

### Determining `a[i]`:
- Since `l[a[i] - 1] == 2`, `a[i]` must be an integer such that its count in the list `a` is exactly 2.
- The exact value of `a[i]` is not specified directly, but it is known that it appears exactly twice in `a`.

### Conclusion:
- The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and followed by another space due to `end=' '`.

### Output:
Since `a[i]` is an integer that appears exactly twice in `a`, and its exact value isn't specified, we can describe the output in terms of `a[i]`.

Output: **a[i] a[i] ** (where `a[i]` is an integer that appears exactly twice in the list `a`)
