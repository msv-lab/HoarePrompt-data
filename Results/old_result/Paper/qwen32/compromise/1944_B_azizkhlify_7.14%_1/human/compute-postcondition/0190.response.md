To determine the output of the given print statement, let's carefully analyze the initial state provided:

1. `res` is a list with at least one element.
2. `i` is the last element of `res` plus 1.
3. `n` is a non-negative integer.
4. `ul` is equal to `ur` if `ul` was originally equal to `ur`. Otherwise, `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
5. If `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `ul` is not equal to the new value of `ur` (which is `ur + 2`).

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

However, the variable `a` is not mentioned in the initial state. To provide an accurate output, we need to make some assumptions based on the context. Given that `i` is defined as the last element of `res` plus 1, it's reasonable to assume that `a` is a list that is indexed by values related to `res`.

Let's assume the following for the sake of explanation (since the exact values of `a` and `res` are not provided):

- Let `res` be `[0, 1, 2]` (a list with at least one element).
- The last element of `res` is `2`, so `i` would be `2 + 1 = 3`.
- Let `a` be a list such that `a[3]` has a known value, for example, `a[3] = 5`.

Given these assumptions, the print statement will print the value of `a[3]` twice, separated by a space, and without a newline at the end.

Therefore, the output of the print statement would be:
Output: **5 5**
