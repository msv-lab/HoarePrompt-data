To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Analysis
1. **Variables Defined:**
   - `t`: Defined but its value is not specified.
   - `ul`: Defined but its value is not specified.
   - `ur`: Initially defined, but it can be increased by 2 if a certain condition is met.
   - `n`: At least 1.
   - `i`: Defined as `n + 2`.

2. **Condition for `ur`:**
   - `ur` is increased by 2 if `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2.

3. **Condition for Breaking Out of Loops:**
   - If `ul` equals `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

4. **The Print Statement:**
   - `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`
   - This means the value of `a[i]` will be printed twice, separated by a space, and no newline will be added at the end.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Determine `i`:**
   - `i` is defined as `n + 2`.
   - Since `n` is at least 1, `i` is at least 3.

2. **Value of `a[i]`:**
   - The value of `a[i]` depends on the list `a` and the value of `i`.
   - Since the initial state does not specify the contents of the list `a`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a[i]`.
   - However, we know that `a[i]` is an element of the list `a` at index `i`.

3. **Print Statement Execution:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space.
   - Since `a[i]` is not explicitly defined, we can only describe its value based on the index `i`.

### Final Output
Given the information provided, the output of the `print` statement will be the value of `a[i]` printed twice, separated by a space. The exact value of `a[i]` cannot be determined without more information about the list `a`.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element of the list a at index n + 2)**
