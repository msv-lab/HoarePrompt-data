Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is a non-zero value and `k` is `2 * k - ul`; `res` is an empty list; `i` is `n - 1`; `ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` was true multiplied by 2, up to the point where the loop breaks if `ul` equals `k * 2`; `a` is a list of integers from the input; `l` is a list of `n` zeros except for the element at index `a[i] - 1` which is now the number of times `a[i]` appears in `a`; `r` is a list of `n` elements where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a[n:2*n]`; `re` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is a non-zero value and `k` is `2 * k - ul`; `res` is a list containing the element `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, otherwise it remains an empty list; `i` is 0; `ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` was true multiplied by 2, up to the point where the loop breaks if `ul` equals `k * 2`; `a` is a list of integers from the input; `l` is a list of `n` zeros except for the element at index `a[i] - 1` which is now the number of times `a[i]` appears in `a`; `r` is a list of `n` elements where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a[n:2*n]`; `re` is 1 if `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, otherwise it remains 0. If `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement breaks.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is a non-zero value and `k` is `2 * k - ul`; `res` is a list containing the element `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, otherwise it remains an empty list; `i` is 1; `ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` was true multiplied by 2, up to the point where the loop breaks if `ul` equals `k * 2`; `a` is a list of integers from the input; `l` is a list of `n` zeros except for the element at index `a[i] - 1` which is now the number of times `a[i]` appears in `a`; `r` is a list of `n` elements where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a[n:2*n]`; `re` is 1 if `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, otherwise it remains 0. If `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement breaks.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is a non-zero value and `k` is `2 * k - ul`; `res` is a list containing the element `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, otherwise it remains an empty list; `i` is 2; `ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` was true multiplied by 2, up to the point where the loop breaks if `ul` equals `k * 2`; `a` is a list of integers from the input; `l` is a list of `n` zeros except for the element at index `a[i] - 1` which is now the number of times `a[i]` appears in `a`; `r` is a list of `n` elements where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a[n:2*n]`; `re` is `re + 1` if `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`. If `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement breaks. If `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement breaks; otherwise, the execution continues as per the original conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
