Postcondition: **`n` remains the same; `k` remains the same; `res` contains up to `k` elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` if `k` is non-zero; `i` is either the value at which the loop broke or `2 * n` if it did not break; `ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` was true, multiplied by 2; `a` remains the same; `l` reflects the counts of each element in `a`; `r` remains the same; `re` is equal to `k` if `k` is non-zero; if `ul != ur`, then `ur` could be different from `ul` if the loop completed all iterations, otherwise `ur` is equal to `ul`.**
