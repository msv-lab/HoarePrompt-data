To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the given initial state and identify the relevant variables and their values.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`n`**: The number of elements in list `a`. (Remains the same, but its exact value is not specified.)
2. **`k`**: An integer value. (Remains the same, but its exact value is not specified.)
3. **`res`**: A list that contains at least one element from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` if `k` is non-zero. This means `res` contains elements from `a` that have a count of 1 in list `l`.
4. **`i`**: The next element in `res` that has not been processed. This implies `i` is an element from `res` that hasn't been printed yet.
5. **`ul`**: The total number of times `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` was true, multiplied by 2. This variable is not directly relevant to the output of the `print(i, end=' ')` statement.
6. **`a`**: A list of integers. (Remains the same, but its exact values are not specified.)
7. **`l`**: A list that reflects the counts of each element in `a`. For example, if `a` is `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, then `l` would be `[1, 2, 1]` (assuming the elements in `a` are 1-based indices).
8. **`r`**: Remains the same, but its exact value is not specified.
9. **`re`**: Equal to `k` if `k` is non-zero. This variable is also not directly relevant to the output of the `print(i, end=' ')` statement.

### Analysis:
- The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space, without a newline.
- The variable `i` is the next element in `res` that has not been processed. This implies `i` is an element from `res` that hasn't been printed yet.
- Since `res` contains elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` if `k` is non-zero, `i` is one such element.

### Conclusion:
The exact value of `i` is not provided, but we know it is an element from `res` that has not been processed yet. Therefore, the output will be the value of `i` followed by a space.

Output: **i (where i is the next element in res that has not been processed)**
