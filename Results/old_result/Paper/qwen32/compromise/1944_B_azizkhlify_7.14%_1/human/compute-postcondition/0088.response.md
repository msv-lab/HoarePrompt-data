Let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t`, `ul`, and `ur` are defined.
- `ul` is not equal to `ur` unless an if condition is true, in which case `ul` equals `ur` and the loop or if statement is broken out of.
- `n` is at least 1.
- If `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged.
- `i` is `n + 1`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is defined as `n + 1`. This means `i` is always one more than the value of `n`.
- The print statement is `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`. This means it will print the element at index `i` of the list `a`, twice, followed by a space.

### Key Points to Consider:
- The value of `a[i]` depends on the value of `i` (which is `n + 1`) and the contents of the list `a`.
- Since `n` is at least 1, `i` is at least 2. Therefore, `a[i]` refers to the element at index 2 of the list `a` (assuming 0-based indexing).

### Conclusion:
The output will be the element at index `i` (which is `n + 1`) of the list `a`, printed twice, followed by a space. Since the exact contents of the list `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a[i]`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the list `a` and the value of `i`.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[n + 1] a[n + 1] (where a[n + 1] is the element at index n + 1 of the list a)**
