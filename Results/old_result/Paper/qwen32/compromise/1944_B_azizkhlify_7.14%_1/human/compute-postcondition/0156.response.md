To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Given Initial State:
1. `t` is a variable (its value is not specified).
2. `ul` is either `k * 2` or `k * 2 + 2 * (count of elements with count 2 in the first two elements of a)`.
3. `ur` is 0.
4. `n` is 2.
5. `k` is either `-2 * (count of elements with count 2 in the first two elements of a)` (and not 0).
6. `a` is a list of integers from the input.
7. `l` is a list of 2 elements where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of the integer `j+1` in the list `a`.
8. `r` is `[0, 1]`.
9. If `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, then `re` is 1 and `res` is `[a[i]]`. Otherwise, `re` remains 0 and `res` remains an empty list.
10. Additionally, if `re` is equal to `k`, the condition holds as specified in the if part. If `re` is not equal to `k`, the state remains unchanged from the precondition.
11. `i` is 1.

### Focus on the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- `i` is given as 1.
- Therefore, `a[i]` translates to `a[1]`, which is the second element of the list `a`.

Since the exact values of the list `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the element at index 1 of the list `a`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the second element of the list `a`.

Output: **a[1]** (where `a[1]` is the second element of the list `a`)
