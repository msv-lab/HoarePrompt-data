Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that n >= 1, `k` is `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not zero, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list where the i-th element is the count of occurrences of integer i+1 in the list `a`, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `ul` is the sum of 2 for each element in `a` that appears exactly twice in the list `l` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all iterations, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing `a[1]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1, and `a[2]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1 for the current `i`, `re` is 3 if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1, otherwise `re` is 2, and `i` is 2.**
