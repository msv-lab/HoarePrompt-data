The code snippet provided reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `L`. The initial state mentions several other variables (`t`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`), but these are not affected by the code snippet.

Since the code snippet only affects the variable `L`, and it is populated with the integers provided in the input, the output state will include the updated value of `L` and keep the other variables as they were described in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 <= `M1`, `M2` <= `N` <= 2 * 10^5. The sum of all `N` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}` are integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, where 1 <= `p_i` <= `N`. `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}` are integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order, where 1 <= `s_i` <= `N`. `L` is a list of integers read from the input.**
