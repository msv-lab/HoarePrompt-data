The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into a list of substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be in the range 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
