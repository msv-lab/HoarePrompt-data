The code snippet `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that the last element of `a` is specified to be `0`, this element will be removed, and `a` will no longer contain this `0` at the end.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers that does not end with `0` anymore; `res` is 0.**
