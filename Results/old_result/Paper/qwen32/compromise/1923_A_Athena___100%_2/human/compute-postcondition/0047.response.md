The code snippet `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that the last element of `a` is 0, this element will be removed. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be in the range 0 ≤ t ≤ 999; `n` is the integer value of the input; `a` is a list that contains at least one element (the last element 0 has been removed); `res` is 0.**
