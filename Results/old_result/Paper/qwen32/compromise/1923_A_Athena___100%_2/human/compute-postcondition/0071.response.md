Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be in the range 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 999, `n` is the integer value of the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with all leading zeros removed, `res` is 0.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, the list `a` will no longer have any leading zeros at the beginning. The variables `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states.
