Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be in the range 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 999, `n` is the integer value of the input, `a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed and must have at least 1 element, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` was equal to 0, `res` is incremented by 1.**
