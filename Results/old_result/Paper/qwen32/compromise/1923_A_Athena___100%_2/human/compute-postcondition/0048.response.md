Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be in the range 0 ≤ t ≤ 999; `n` is the integer value of the input; `a` is a list with all trailing zeros removed; `res` is 0.**

In simple terms, after all iterations of the loop, the list `a` will no longer have any trailing zeros at the end. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states.
