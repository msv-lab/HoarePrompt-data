Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is 0; `n` is undefined as there are no more test cases to process; `a` is undefined as there are no more test cases to process; `res` is undefined as there are no more test cases to process.**

In simple terms, after all iterations are complete, `t` will be 0 because all test cases have been processed. The variables `n` and `a` will not hold any meaningful values as there are no more test cases to read and process, and `res` will also be undefined in this context because there are no more results to compute.
