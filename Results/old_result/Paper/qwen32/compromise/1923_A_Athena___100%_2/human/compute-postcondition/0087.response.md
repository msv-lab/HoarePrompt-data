Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be in the range 0 â‰¤ t-1 â‰¤ 999, `n` is the integer value of the input, `a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed and must have at least 1 element, `i` is incremented by 1, `res` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the variable `res` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and the incremented value of `i` remain as per their initial states.
