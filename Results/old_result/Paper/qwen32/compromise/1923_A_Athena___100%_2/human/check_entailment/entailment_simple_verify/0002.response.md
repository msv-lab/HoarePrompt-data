### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program to ensure it correctly solves the problem. The provided program follows these steps:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` representing the cells.

2. **Initial Trimming:**
   - The program removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` using `pop(0)` and `pop()`. This step is correct because leading and trailing free cells do not affect the minimum number of moves needed to form a contiguous block of chips.

3. **Counting Moves:**
   - The program then iterates through the trimmed list `a`. For each zero encountered, it increments the result `res` by 1. This step assumes that each zero represents a free cell that needs to be filled by a chip from the right, which is correct.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result `res` for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis with Annotated Code:

Let's look at the annotated code and verify the behavior:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0) # Remove leading zeros
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop() # Remove trailing zeros
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1 # Count the number of zeros in the trimmed list
        
        print(res)
```

- **Initial Trimming:**
  - `while a and a[0] == 0: a.pop(0)` correctly removes leading zeros.
  - `while a and a[-1] == 0: a.pop()` correctly removes trailing zeros.
  
- **Counting Moves:**
  - `for i in range(len(a)): if a[i] == 0: res += 1` correctly counts the number of zeros in the trimmed list. Each zero represents a gap that needs to be filled by a chip from the right, which requires exactly one move.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the program with the provided example.

**First Test Case:**
- Input: `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
- After trimming: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
- Number of zeros: `1`
- Output: `1` (Correct)

**Second Test Case:**
- Input: `0 1 0 0 0 0`
- After trimming: `1`
- Number of zeros: `0`
- Output: `0` (Correct)

**Third Test Case:**
- Input: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
- After trimming: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
- Number of zeros: `0`
- Output: `0` (Correct)

**Fourth Test Case:**
- Input: `1 0 1 0 1`
- After trimming: `1 0 1 0 1`
- Number of zeros: `2`
- Output: `2` (Correct)

**Fifth Test Case:**
- Input: `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
- After trimming: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
- Number of zeros: `3`
- Output: `3` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly computes the minimum number of operations required to form a contiguous block of chips for each test case. The initial assessment is accurate, and the program behaves as expected.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
