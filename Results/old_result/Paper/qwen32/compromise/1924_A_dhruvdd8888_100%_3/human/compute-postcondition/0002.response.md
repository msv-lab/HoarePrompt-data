Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets read from the input; `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.**

Explanation: The variable `us` is created as a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`) remain unchanged.
