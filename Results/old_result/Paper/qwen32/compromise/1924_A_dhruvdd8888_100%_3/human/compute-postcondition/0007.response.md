To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

### Code Analysis

The loop iterates over each character `i` in the string `s`. If the character `i` is in the set `us` (which contains the first `k` lowercase English alphabets), it is added to the set `win`. If the size of `win` reaches `k` (indicating that all `k` distinct characters have been encountered in order), the last character `i` is appended to the list `ans`, `ps` is incremented by 1, and the set `win` is cleared.

### Initial State Recap

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5.
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000.
- `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `win` is an empty set.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `ps` is 0.

### Output State Calculation

1. **`win` Set**: After the loop, `win` will be empty because it is cleared each time `len(win) == k`.
2. **`ans` List**: This list will contain the last character of each sequence of `k` distinct characters found in `s`.
3. **`ps` Variable**: This variable keeps track of the number of times all `k` distinct characters have been encountered in sequence.

### Example

Suppose `k = 3`, `s = "abcabcabc"`, and `us = {'a', 'b', 'c'}`:
- The first sequence "abc" will add 'c' to `ans` and clear `win`.
- The second sequence "abc" will add 'c' to `ans` and clear `win`.
- The third sequence "abc" will add 'c' to `ans` and clear `win`.
- `ps` will be 3 after the loop.

### Conclusion

After the loop finishes, `win` will be empty, `ans` will contain the last character of each sequence of `k` distinct characters, and `ps` will contain the count of such sequences.

Output State: **`win` is an empty set; `ans` is a list containing the last character of each sequence of `k` distinct characters found in `s`; `ps` is the count of such sequences.**
