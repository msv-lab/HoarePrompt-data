t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26. m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000. s is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
