Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program only consists of input handling functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) and does not contain any logic to solve the problem as described. The program does not perform any operations to rearrange the permutation or implement the binary search algorithm as required. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
