To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether the program correctly solves the problem as described. The problem requires us to perform a binary search on a permutation after potentially making up to two swaps to ensure that the element at the final position `l` is equal to `x`.

The provided code does not contain the actual logic for solving the problem. It only includes functions for reading input. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are utility functions to read integers, a map of integers, a list of integers, a string, and a list of strings from the input, respectively. However, there is no logic for determining which swaps to make or how to perform the binary search.

Given that the program lacks the core logic to solve the problem, it is incorrect. The correct program should include:

1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reading `n` and `x`, and the permutation `p`.
3. Determining the necessary swaps to ensure that after performing the binary search, `p[l]` is equal to `x`.
4. Performing the swaps if necessary.
5. Printing the number of swaps and the indices of the swaps.
6. Running the binary search (though the result of the binary search is not needed for the output, it is implied that the array should be set up correctly for it).

Since the provided code does not include these steps, it cannot be considered correct for solving the problem.

Reasoning: The provided code only includes input reading functions and lacks the logic for determining and performing the necessary swaps, as well as the binary search logic.
Correctness: **False**
