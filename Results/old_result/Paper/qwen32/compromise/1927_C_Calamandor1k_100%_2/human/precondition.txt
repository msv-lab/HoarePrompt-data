t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case in the list 'cases' is a tuple containing three elements: (n, m, k) where n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= 2 * min(n, m). The sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 4 * 10^5. Additionally, each test case contains two lists: a list 'a' of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, and a list 'b' of m integers where each element b_j satisfies 1 <= b_j <= 10^6.
