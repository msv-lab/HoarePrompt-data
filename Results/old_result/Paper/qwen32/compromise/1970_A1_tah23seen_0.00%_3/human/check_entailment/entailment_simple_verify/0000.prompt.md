You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n, where `d[0]` is 0 and `d[n]` is 0, representing the balance of parentheses up to each position in `s`.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is the same as `s`; `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the balance of parentheses up to each position in `s`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the string `s` which is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence consisting only of characters "(" and ")" with its length not exceeding 500,000.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the sorting step. The problem description specifies that the sorting should be done first by prefix balance in increasing order and then by position in decreasing order when the prefix balances are the same. However, the current implementation sorts by position in increasing order instead of decreasing order when the prefix balances are the same. This can lead to incorrect results.

Let's consider an example:

Input:
```
((()))
```

Expected Output:
```
()()()
```

Explanation of the expected output:
1. Compute the prefix balance:
   - Prefix balance: 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0
   - Position: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
   - Character: (, (, (, ), ), ), )

2. Sort by prefix balance (increasing) and then by position (decreasing):
   - Prefix balance: 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3
   - Position: 6, 0, 5, 4, 1, 3, 2, 0, 3
   - Character: ), (, ), ), (, ), (, (, )

3. The sorted sequence of characters is: `()()()`

However, the given code sorts by position in increasing order when prefix balances are the same, which would result in a different sequence:

Incorrect Output from the code:
```
((()))
```

This is because the code does not correctly handle the tie-breaking rule specified in the problem description.

To fix this, the sorting step should be modified to sort by position in decreasing order when prefix balances are the same. The correct sorting key should be:
```python
d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
```

With this change, the program would produce the correct output for the given example and other test cases.
