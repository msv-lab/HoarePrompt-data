You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and a and b are the integers from the last test case, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: bob
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `a` and `b` are integers from the last test case, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then prints "bob" if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and "alice" if the sum is odd. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for the last test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. The main issue is that the logic to determine the winner is incorrect. The program simply checks if the sum of coins `(a + b)` is even or odd, and then declares the winner based on that. However, this does not align with the optimal strategy for both players.

Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Game Strategy**: 
   - Both players play optimally.
   - The game ends when a player cannot remove a coin from their wallet.
   - The optimal strategy depends on the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of coins in each wallet.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - If both wallets have the same number of coins, the player who starts (Alice) can always mirror the opponent's move, ensuring that Bob will eventually be left with no coins.
   - If the wallets have different numbers of coins, the player with the larger number of coins can always reduce their coins to match the opponent's coins, forcing the opponent into a losing position.

3. **Correct Logic**:
   - If `a == b`, Alice wins because she can mirror Bob's moves.
   - If `a != b`, the player with the larger number of coins wins because they can force the other player into a losing position.

The provided program does not implement this logic correctly. Instead, it simply checks if the sum `(a + b)` is even or odd, which does not accurately reflect the game's rules and optimal strategy.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the test case `a = 1`, `b = 4`:
- According to the program, since `1 + 4 = 5` (odd), it would print "alice".
- However, if Alice swaps wallets with Bob on her first move, she will have 4 coins and Bob will have 1 coin. Bob can then swap back, and Alice will again have 1 coin and Bob will have 4 coins. Alice can continue to force Bob into a losing position by mirroring his moves until Bob is left with no coins. Thus, Alice should win in this case.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly determine the winner for all possible cases, so it is incorrect.
