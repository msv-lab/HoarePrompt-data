Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that need to be addressed to correctly determine the winner of the game:

1. **Indentation Error**: The logic for determining the winner is outside the loop, so it only executes after all test cases have been read. This means it only processes the last test case.

2. **Incorrect Winner Determination**: The logic `(a + b) % 2 == 0` is incorrect for determining the winner. The correct strategy involves game theory, specifically Grundy numbers or Nim-sum, but in this case, a simpler observation can be used: if the number of coins in both wallets is the same, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the first player's (Alice) moves and win. If they are different, the first player (Alice) can always make a move to force a win.

3. **Output Formatting**: The print statements include extra spaces, which do not match the expected output format.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This version reads each test case, correctly determines the winner based on whether the number of coins in both wallets is the same, and prints the result without extra spaces.
