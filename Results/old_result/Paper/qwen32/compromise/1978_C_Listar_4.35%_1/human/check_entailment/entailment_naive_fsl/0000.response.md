Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as specified in the problem description. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues.

#### Issues in the Code:

1. **Function `func_2`: Incorrect Calculation of Maximum `k`**:
   - The function `func_2` calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) incorrectly. The correct formula for the maximum Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is `n*(n-1)/2` (or `(n^2 - n)/2`).

2. **Function `func_1`: Incorrect Permutation Construction**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for constructing the permutation based on the given `k`. The logic within this function is flawed and does not correctly generate a permutation with the desired Manhattan value `k`.

3. **Function `func_4`: Handling of Odd `k`**:
   - The function `func_4` correctly identifies that if `k` is odd, no valid permutation exists. However, the logic in `func_2` incorrectly calculates `max_k`, which can lead to incorrect results even if `k` is even.

4. **General Logic**:
   - The overall logic for constructing the permutation is not correct. The provided code does not properly handle the construction of permutations for all possible values of `n` and `k`.

#### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the test case `n = 3` and `k = 4`:
- The correct permutation that gives a Manhattan value of 4 is `[3, 1, 2]`.
- However, the provided code will not generate this permutation correctly due to the flawed logic in `func_1`.

#### Correct Calculation of Maximum `k`:
The correct maximum Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is:
\[ \text{max\_k} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \]
For example, for `n = 3`, the maximum `k` is `3`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the logic and the incorrect calculation of `max_k`, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is `False`.
