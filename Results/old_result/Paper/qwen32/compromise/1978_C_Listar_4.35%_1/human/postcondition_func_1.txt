The function accepts two integers, `n` (a positive integer) and `k` (a non-negative integer). It returns `0, 0` if `k` is odd or if `k` exceeds the maximum allowed value `max_k`. Otherwise, it returns `n` and `k`, where `k` is a non-negative even integer and `k` is less than or equal to `max_k`. The value of `max_k` is calculated as ((n^2 - 1) // 2) if `n` is odd, and (n^2 // 2) if `n` is even.
