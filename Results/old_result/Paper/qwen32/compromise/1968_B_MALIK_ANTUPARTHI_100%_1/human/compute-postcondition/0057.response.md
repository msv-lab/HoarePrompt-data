Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is the value of the first integer from the user input and must be greater than 0, `c` is the value of the second integer from the user input, `d` is the value of the string input by the user, `e` is the value of the user input, `j` is `b`, `k` is `b` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of all variables remain unchanged. The execution of the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `j`, and `k`.
