Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is the value of the user input, `e` is the value of the user input. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `j + 1`. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `k` remains `j` and `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
