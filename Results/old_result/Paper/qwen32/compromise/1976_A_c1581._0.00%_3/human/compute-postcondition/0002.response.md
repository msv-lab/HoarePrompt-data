To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head only involves the variable `char` and the iterable `password`.

Given the loop:
```python
for char in password:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `password` is a non-empty iterable. The current state indicates that `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`. This means that `password` is guaranteed to be non-empty, so no adjustment is needed for `password` to ensure the loop executes.

The variables `digits` and `letters` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Thus, the state before the loop starts is already suitable for the loop to execute. The state remains:

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`, and each character in the string is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is an empty list; `letters` is an empty list.**
