The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to `x` and `y`. This means that the values of `x` and `y` will be updated based on the input provided, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`; `res` is 0; `x` is the first integer input; `y` is the second integer input; `i` is 1**.

In natural language: The values of `x` and `y` are updated to the integers provided by the input, while all other variables retain their initial values.
