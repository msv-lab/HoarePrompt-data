Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is a list containing four tuples `((x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4))`; `res` is 0; `i` is 3; `p1` is \((coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])^2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])^2\); `p2` is \((coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])^2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])^2\); `x` and `y` are the new input integers.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all four iterations, the `coord` list will contain four coordinate tuples, each representing a pair of integers `(x, y)` input during each iteration. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `i` will be 3, reflecting the final iteration index. The variables `p1` and `p2` will be calculated based on the differences in the x and y coordinates of the first two and last two points in the `coord` list, respectively. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the values of the last input coordinates.
