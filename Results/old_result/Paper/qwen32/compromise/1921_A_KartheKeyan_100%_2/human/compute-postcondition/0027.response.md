The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 4. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`; `res` is 0; `i` is 1; `p1` is undefined; `p2` is undefined; `x` is the first input integer; `y` is the second input integer.**
