The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `coord` initially contains two tuples `((x1, y1), (x, y))`, after appending `(x, y)`, `coord` will contain three tuples `((x1, y1), (x, y), (x, y))`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` must be a non-zero integer, `coord` is a list containing three tuples `((x1, y1), (x, y), (x, y))`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `p1` is undefined, `p2` is undefined, `x` and `y` are the new input integers.**
