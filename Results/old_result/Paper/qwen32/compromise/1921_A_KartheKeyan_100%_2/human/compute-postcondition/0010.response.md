Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is a list containing two tuples `((x, y), (x, y))`; `res` is 0; `x` is the first integer input; `y` is the second integer input; `i` is 1**

Natural Language: The `coord` list now contains two tuples, the original `(x, y)` and the newly appended `(x, y)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
