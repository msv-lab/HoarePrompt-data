Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, it receives four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The function returns a value indicating the side length of the square for each test case.**
