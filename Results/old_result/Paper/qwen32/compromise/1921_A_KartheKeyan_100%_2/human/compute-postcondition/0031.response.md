The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The previous values of `x` and `y` are undefined, but after the execution of the code, they will hold the values provided by the input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `coord`, `res`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` must be a non-zero integer, `coord` is a list containing two tuples `((x1, y1), (x, y))`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `p1` is undefined, `p2` is undefined, `x` and `y` are the new input integers**.
