The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. This means the previous values of `x` and `y` (which were the first and second input integers) are replaced by the new values provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`; `res` is 0; `i` is 1; `p1` is undefined; `p2` is undefined; `x` and `y` are the new input integers.**
