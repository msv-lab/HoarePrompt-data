You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It calculates and prints the side length of the square for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
- We need to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners.
- The square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.
- The input consists of multiple test cases.
- For each test case, we are given four lines with two integers each, representing the coordinates of the square's corners.
- The output should be the area of the square for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the square's corners. These coordinates are stored in the list `coord`.

2. **Sorting Coordinates:**
   - The coordinates are sorted. Sorting the coordinates helps in easily identifying pairs of adjacent sides of the square.

3. **Calculating Side Lengths:**
   - The program calculates the squared distance between the first two sorted points `p1` and between the last two sorted points `p2`. These distances represent the squared lengths of two adjacent sides of the square.
   - The side length of the square is then calculated as the square root of either `p1` or `p2` since both should be equal (sides of a square are equal).

4. **Calculating Area:**
   - The area is calculated by squaring the side length.
   - The result is rounded and printed.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Side Lengths:**
  - The program calculates the area using the square root of the product of `p1` and `p2`, which is incorrect. It should use the square root of either `p1` or `p2` to get the side length of the square.
  - The correct formula for the area should be `side_length ** 2`, where `side_length = math.sqrt(p1)` or `math.sqrt(p2)`.

### Corrected Calculation:
- The corrected calculation should be:
  ```python
  side_length = math.sqrt(p1)  # or math.sqrt(p2), since they should be equal
  area = side_length ** 2
  print(round(area))
  ```

### Conclusion:
The given program has an incorrect formula for calculating the area of the square. It should calculate the side length using the square root of either `p1` or `p2` and then square it to get the area.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
