Output State: **`tree` is a deque representing the path from one leaf to the other in the tree, `empty` is False, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`.**

Natural language: The value of `idx` is determined as the index of the `start` integer within the `tree` deque. The values of `tree`, `empty`, and `start` remain unchanged.
