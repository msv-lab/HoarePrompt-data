The code reads two integers from the input, the first being `n` and the second being `t`. Given the initial state, `n` is already an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, and `t` is already an integer such that t=1. The code snippet does not change the values of `n` and `t` but rather assigns them based on the input. Therefore, the values of `n` and `t` remain as provided in the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node of the stone for each round.**
