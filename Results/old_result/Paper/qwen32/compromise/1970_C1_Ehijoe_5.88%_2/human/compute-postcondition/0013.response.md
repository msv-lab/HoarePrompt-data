Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5), an integer `t` which is always 1, a list of `n-1` edges representing the tree structure, and a list of `t` integers representing the starting node of a stone for a round. The tree has exactly two leaves. The function returns the result of the stone movement process based on the given starting node.**
