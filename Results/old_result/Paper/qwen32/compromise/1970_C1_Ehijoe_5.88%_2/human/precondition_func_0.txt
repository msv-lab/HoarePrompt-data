n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer such that t=1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node of the stone for each round.
