You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i < n, and the length of arr is n, with 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function is called once for each test case, and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] += 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < `n`, and the length of `arr` is `n`, with 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `freq` is a list where the i-th element represents the number of times the integer `i-1` appears in `arr`.
    cou = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if freq[i] >= 2:
            continue
        
        if freq[i] == 1:
            cou += 1
        
        if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
            print(i)
            break
        
    #State: The loop will print the first index `i` where `freq[i]` is `0` or the second index `i` where `freq[i]` is `1`. The state of `arr` and `freq` remains unchanged, and `cou` will be either `1` or `2` depending on which condition caused the loop to terminate.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `arr` and `freq` are not provided, we cannot determine a specific numerical output. However, we can describe the output state in a general form:
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. Each integer `a_i` in the list satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, where `n` is the length of the list `arr`. The length of `arr` is `n` and `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`. The function returns a value based on the elements of the list `arr`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
