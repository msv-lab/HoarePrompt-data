The code snippet initializes a list `freq` with `n + 1` zeros. This means that `freq` now has a length of `n + 1`, and each element in this list is 0. The initial state of `arr` and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < `n`, and the length of `arr` is `n`, with 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `freq` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
