Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine the final score of the game, which is the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it.

### Key Observations:
1. **Turns and Moves**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice) or simply removing them from `a` (Bob).
   - Alice starts first.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice will try to add elements to `c` that maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from adding elements that would increase the MEX.

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
   - If an integer `i` appears less than twice in `a`, it can be added to `c` to potentially increase the MEX.
   - If an integer `i` appears at least twice, it doesn't matter which player picks it first because it won't affect the MEX if it's picked twice.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases and processes each one as follows:
1. It counts the frequency of each element in the array `a`.
2. It then iterates through the possible values from `0` to `n` (inclusive) and checks the frequency of each value.
3. If a value appears less than twice, it increments a counter `cou`.
4. If `cou` reaches 2 or the value appears zero times, it prints the current value as the MEX and breaks out of the loop.

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly counts the frequency of each element in the array.
- It correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that appears less than twice or not at all, which is the MEX.
- The logic to determine the MEX is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally based on the given rules.

**Correctness: True**
