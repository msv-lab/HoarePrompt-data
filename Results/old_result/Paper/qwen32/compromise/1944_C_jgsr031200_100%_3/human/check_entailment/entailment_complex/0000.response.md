### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem by calculating the MEX of the array `c` after the game between Alice and Bob has ended. The program implements a strategy that counts the frequency of each number in the initial array `arr` and then determines the MEX based on the frequency of numbers.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program logic:

1. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a frequency list `freq` of size `n + 1` to zero. This list will store the frequency of each number in the input array `arr`.
   - It iterates through `arr` and increments the corresponding index in `freq` for each number encountered.

2. **Determine MEX**:
   - The program then iterates through the `freq` list. It keeps a count `cou` of numbers that appear once in `arr`.
   - If a number appears at least twice, it skips to the next number.
   - If a number appears exactly once, it increments the `cou`.
   - The loop terminates and the MEX is printed when either:
     - `cou` equals 2 (indicating that two numbers appear exactly once in `arr`), or
     - a number with a frequency of 0 is encountered (indicating that this number is the smallest non-negative integer not in `arr`).

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - The strategy inherently considers the optimal play by both players. Alice will try to maximize the MEX by choosing numbers that do not appear often, while Bob will try to minimize it by choosing numbers that appear often. The MEX calculation after the game effectively captures the result of their optimal strategies.

4. **Validation Against Example**:
   - The provided example test cases are correctly handled by the program:
     - For the input `[0, 0, 1, 1]`, the MEX is `2` because the numbers `0` and `1` appear twice, and the smallest number not in `arr` is `2`.
     - For the input `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, the MEX is `1` because numbers `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3` appear once, and the smallest number not in `arr` is `4` but considering the optimal play, the MEX is `1` (since the game's score is defined by the MEX of `c` and the numbers chosen by the players).
     - For the input `[1, 1]`, the MEX is `0` because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `arr`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game, considering the optimal play by both Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
