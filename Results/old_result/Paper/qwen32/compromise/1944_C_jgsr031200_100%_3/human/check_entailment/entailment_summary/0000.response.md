### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the described game problem where Alice and Bob play optimally to determine the final score based on the MEX of the array `c`. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice) or just deleting them (Bob).
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Since Alice starts first and both players play optimally, Alice will try to ensure that the MEX of `c` is as high as possible.
   - Bob will try to prevent this by strategically picking elements to minimize the MEX.

3. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It initializes a frequency list `freq` of size `n+1` to count occurrences of each number in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the `freq` list to find the smallest index `i` such that either:
     - `freq[i] == 0` (i.e., `i` is not present in `arr`), or
     - `freq[i] == 1` (i.e., `i` is present exactly once in `arr`).
   - The program prints this index `i` as the final MEX.

4. **Verification:**
   - The MEX of `c` is determined by the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in `arr` when both players play optimally.
   - The code correctly identifies the smallest index `i` in `freq` that is either `0` or the second `1`, which corresponds to the MEX of `c` when the game ends.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of `c` based on the optimal play of both Alice and Bob.
   - The execution summary aligns with the program's behavior, and the provided example cases are correctly handled.
