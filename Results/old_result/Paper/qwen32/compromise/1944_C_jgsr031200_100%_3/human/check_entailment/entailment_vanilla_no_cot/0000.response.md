Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem described. Here are the issues:

1. The program does not correctly implement the logic for the game between Alice and Bob.
2. The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game, but it incorrectly assumes that the MEX can be determined solely based on the frequency of elements in `arr` without simulating the game.
3. The program does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob take turns and Alice wants to maximize the MEX while Bob wants to minimize it.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to simulate the game and keep track of the elements that Alice adds to `c`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def mex(arr):
    i = 0
    while True:
        if i not in arr:
            return i
        i += 1

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each element
    freq = [0] * n
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] += 1
    
    # Alice and Bob take turns
    c = []
    turn = 0  # 0 for Alice, 1 for Bob
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if freq[j] > 0:
                if turn == 0:  # Alice's turn
                    c.append(j)
                freq[j] -= 1
                turn = 1 - turn  # Switch turns
                break
    
    # Find the MEX of the final array c
    print(mex(c))
```

This corrected program simulates the game by alternating turns between Alice and Bob, appending elements to `c` according to the rules, and then calculates the MEX of the final array `c`.
