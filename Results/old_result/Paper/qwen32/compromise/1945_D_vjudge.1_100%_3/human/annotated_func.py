#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and b is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(n, k, a, b):
    c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]
    suff = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, and `c` is a list of n integers where each element c_i is the minimum of a_i and b_i. `suff` is a list of (n + 1) integers, where suff[i] is the sum of c[j] for all j from i to n-1.
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k):
        ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i + 1])
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, `c` is a list of n integers where each element c_i is the minimum of a_i and b_i, `suff` is a list of (n + 1) integers, where suff[i] is the sum of c[j] for all j from i to n-1, and `ans` is the minimum value of a[i] + suff[i + 1] for all i from 0 to k-1.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum value of a[i] + suff[i + 1] for all i from 0 to k-1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b` as input. It calculates and prints the minimum value of `a[i] + sum(min(a[j], b[j]) for j from i+1 to n-1)` for all `i` from `0` to `k-1`.
