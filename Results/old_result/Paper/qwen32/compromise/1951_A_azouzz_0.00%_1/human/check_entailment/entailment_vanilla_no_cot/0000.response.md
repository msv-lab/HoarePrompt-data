Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem description requires a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` that scans subdirectories in the current directory, checks if their names are within a specified numeric range, and then generates specific files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for each `.html` file found within those directories. However, the given program defines a function `func_1` that reads input values and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the count of '1's in a string and the presence of '11' in the string. This is entirely unrelated to the task described in the problem.
