Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the closest city logic and the calculation of the minimum number of coins needed to travel between cities based on the given rules.

Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**: The code does not explicitly calculate the closest city for each city. Instead, it seems to be attempting to calculate some cumulative distances, but this approach does not align with the problem's requirement to find the closest city and use it to minimize the cost.

2. **Logic for Travel Cost**: The program calculates costs using a formula involving powers and differences, but this does not correspond to the problem's rules for traveling between cities. The problem requires either traveling directly between cities (paying the distance) or traveling to the closest city repeatedly (paying 1 coin per step).

3. **Handling Queries**: The program attempts to handle queries by calculating some precomputed values (`b` array) and then using these values to compute the cost for each query. However, this approach does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements for determining the minimum cost based on the closest city rule.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

**Actual Output:** The program does not produce the expected output because it does not correctly implement the logic for finding the closest city and calculating the minimum travel cost based on the rules provided.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
