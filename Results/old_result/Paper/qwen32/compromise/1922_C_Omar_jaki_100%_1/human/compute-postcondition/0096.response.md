To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the expression inside the `print` statement step-by-step.

### Given Initial State:
- `u` is defined as `c_new - 1`.
- There is a list `[0, 0, y - x, y - x, y - x + v, y - x + v, y - x + v]`.
- `c` and `d` are values returned by `r()`, specifically `c_new` and `d_new`, with the condition that `c < d`.
- `t` is `False`.
- `a` is a tuple `(-1000000000.0, c_new, d_new, 2000000000.0)`.
- `b` is a list `[0, 0, 1, 1]`.

### Expression to Evaluate:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:

1. **Identify the indices in the list `b`:**
   - The list `b` is `[0, 0, 1, 1]`.
   - The expression `(d - 1) * 2` computes the index for the element at position `(d - 1) * 2` in the list `b`.
   - Similarly, `(c - 1) * 2` computes the index for the element at position `(c - 1) * 2` in the list `b`.

2. **Determine the values of `c` and `d`:**
   - Since `c` and `d` are `c_new` and `d_new` respectively, and `c < d`, we need to know the specific values of `c_new` and `d_new` to proceed.
   - However, without the exact values of `c_new` and `d_new`, we can still reason about the general behavior based on the constraints.

3. **Evaluate the indices:**
   - Let's assume `c = 1` and `d = 2` (as an example where `c < d`).
     - For `c = 1`, `(c - 1) * 2 = (1 - 1) * 2 = 0`.
     - For `d = 2`, `(d - 1) * 2 = (2 - 1) * 2 = 2`.
   - Therefore, the expression becomes `b[2] - b[0]`.

4. **Access the elements in the list `b`:**
   - `b[2]` is `1` (since the list `b` is `[0, 0, 1, 1]`).
   - `b[0]` is `0` (since the list `b` is `[0, 0, 1, 1]`).

5. **Compute the result:**
   - `b[2] - b[0] = 1 - 0 = 1`.

### Generalization:
- The result `1` is derived from the specific values `c = 1` and `d = 2`.
- If `c` and `d` were different but still satisfied `c < d`, the indices would change accordingly, but the difference `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]` would always be `1` given the structure of the list `b`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the structure of the list `b` and the given constraints, the output of the `print` statement is always `1` when `c < d`.

Output: **1**
