To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` as they are the ones defined in the loop head. The loop uses the `zip` function to iterate over slices of the list `a`.

Given the loop:
```python
for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` were such that they corresponded to some indices of the list `a`. Specifically, if we denote the current index in the first slice of `a` as `i`, then:
- `w` was `a[i]`
- `x` was `a[i+1]`
- `y` was `a[i+2]`
- `z` was `a[i+3]`

After the loop completes an iteration, `i` would have incremented by 1, meaning the next iteration would use:
- `w` as `a[i+1]`
- `x` as `a[i+2]`
- `y` as `a[i+3]`
- `z` as `a[i+4]`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `b` is `[0, 0, y - x, v]`

We need to determine the new values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` for the next iteration. Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, let's assume that in the previous iteration, `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` were `a[i]`, `a[i+1]`, `a[i+2]`, and `a[i+3]` respectively. Therefore, for the next iteration, they would be `a[i+1]`, `a[i+2]`, `a[i+3]`, and `a[i+4]`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`b` is `[0, 0, y - x, v]`, `w` is `a[i+1]`, `x` is `a[i+2]`, `y` is `a[i+3]`, `z` is `a[i+4]`**

However, since we don't have the specific values of `a` or `i`, we can only express the next state in terms of the list `a` and the index `i`:
State: **`b` is `[0, 0, y - x, v]`, `w` is the next element after the current `w` in `a`, `x` is the next element after the current `x` in `a`, `y` is the next element after the current `y` in `a`, `z` is the next element after the current `z` in `a`**
