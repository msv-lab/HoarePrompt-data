To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the print statement step by step:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `u` is defined as `c_new - 2` where `c_new > 1`.
   - `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()` in this iteration (`c_new` and `d_new`).
   - `t` is `False`.
   - `a` is `(-1000000000.0, c_new, d_new, 2000000000.0)`.
   - `b` is `[0, 0, 1, 1]`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])`.
   - To evaluate this, we need to know the values of `c` and `d`.

3. **Determine the Values of `c` and `d`:**
   - Since `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()`, we don't have explicit values for them from the initial state. However, we can infer that `c` and `d` are integers greater than 1 because `c_new > 1` and `d_new` would also logically be greater than 1 if they follow the same pattern.

4. **Evaluate the Indices:**
   - `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` are the indices used to access elements in the list `b`.
   - Since `b` is `[0, 0, 1, 1]`, valid indices for accessing elements in `b` are 0, 1, 2, and 3.

5. **Possible Values of Indices:**
   - If `c` and `d` are both 2, then `(d - 1) * 2 = (2 - 1) * 2 = 0` and `(c - 1) * 2 = (2 - 1) * 2 = 0`.
     - This means `b[0] - b[0] = 0 - 0 = 0`.
   - If `c` is 2 and `d` is 3, then `(d - 1) * 2 = (3 - 1) * 2 = 4` (which is out of bounds for `b`).
   - If `c` is 3 and `d` is 2, then `(c - 1) * 2 = (3 - 1) * 2 = 4` (which is out of bounds for `b`).
   - If `c` and `d` are both 3, then `(d - 1) * 2 = (3 - 1) * 2 = 4` (which is out of bounds for `b`).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the constraints and the list `b`, the only valid scenario is when both `c` and `d` are 2, leading to `b[0] - b[0] = 0`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **0**
