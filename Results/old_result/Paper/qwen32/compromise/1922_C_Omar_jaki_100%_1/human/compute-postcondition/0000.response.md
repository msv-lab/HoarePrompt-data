The given code snippet defines a lambda function `r` that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer.

Given the initial state, no variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, `y_i`) are directly modified by this code snippet. Instead, `r` is prepared to be used later to read and process input data.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9. `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. Additionally, for each city, the closest city is uniquely determined. `r` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer.**
