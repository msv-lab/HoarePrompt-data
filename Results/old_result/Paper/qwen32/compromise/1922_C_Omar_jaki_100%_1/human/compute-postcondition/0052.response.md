Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state:

Initial State: 
- `b` is `[0, 0, y - x, y - x]`
- `w` is the next element after the current `w` in `a`
- `x` is the next element after the current `x` in `a`
- `y` is the next element after the current `y` in `a`
- `z` is the next element after the current `z` in `a`

Code Snippet:
```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

This line appends two new elements to the list `b`. Let's break down what these elements are:

1. `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`:
   - `b[-2]` refers to the third last element of `b`, which is `y - x`.
   - `v ** (v > x - w)` evaluates to `v` if `v > x - w` is `True`, otherwise it evaluates to `1`.

2. `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`:
   - `b[-1]` refers to the last element of `b`, which is also `y - x`.
   - `v ** (v > z - y)` evaluates to `v` if `v > z - y` is `True`, otherwise it evaluates to `1`.

So, the new elements being added to `b` are:
- `y - x + v ** (v > x - w)`
- `y - x + v ** (v > z - y)`

Thus, the updated `b` will be:
- `[0, 0, y - x, y - x, y - x + v ** (v > x - w), y - x + v ** (v > z - y)]`

Other variables (`w`, `x`, `y`, `z`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b` is `[0, 0, y - x, y - x, y - x + v ** (v > x - w), y - x + v ** (v > z - y)]`; `w` is the next element after the current `w` in `a`; `x` is the next element after the current `x` in `a`; `y` is the next element after the current `y` in `a`; `z` is the next element after the current `z` in `a`**
