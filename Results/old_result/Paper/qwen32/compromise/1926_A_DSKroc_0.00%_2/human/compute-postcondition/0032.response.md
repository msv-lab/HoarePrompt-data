The value of `bc` is incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `s`, `q`, `ac`, and `i` remain unchanged as per the given conditions. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `s` is a non-empty string; `q` is incremented by 1; `i` is the next character in the string `s`; if `i` is 'A', then `ac` is 1 and `bc` is 1 (previously 0), otherwise `ac` is 0 and `bc` is 2 (previously 1)**.
