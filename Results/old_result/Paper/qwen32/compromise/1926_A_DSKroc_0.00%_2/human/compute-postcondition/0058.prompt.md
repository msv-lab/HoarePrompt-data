Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive, with the value provided by the user input. The strings for the test cases remain distinct and each of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    ac = 0
    bc = 0
    s = input()
    for i in s:
        if i == 'A':
            ac += 1
        else:
            bc += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `ac` is the number of 'A's in the string `s`; `bc` is the number of characters in `s` that are not 'A'; `s` is the original string provided by the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `ac` is the count of 'A's in the string `s`; `bc` is the count of all other characters in the string `s`; `s` is the provided string; `q` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `ac` is the count of 'A' characters in the string `s`; `bc` is the count of non-'A' characters in the string `s`; `s` is the string provided by the user input; `q` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
