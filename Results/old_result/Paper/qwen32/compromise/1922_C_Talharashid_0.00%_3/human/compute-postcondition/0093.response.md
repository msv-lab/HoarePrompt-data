Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `end` with values of `s` after each iteration, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from `len(lst) - 1` to `0` with corresponding values of `s` after each iteration, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` are integers obtained from the input, `inc` is -1, `s` is the final accumulated value after all iterations, `m` must be greater than 0.**

In this output state, the value of `start` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
