The provided code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the cumulative sums stored in `d2` at indices `start` and `end`. The variables `d1`, `d2`, `start`, and `end` are used in the calculation, and their values remain unchanged. The variable `s2` is introduced and assigned the calculated value.

Given the initial state, the only new variable introduced and assigned a value is `s2`. The value of `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t-1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from `len(lst) - 2` down to `0` with values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is `start - 1`; `end` is `end - 1`; `inc` is `-1`; `m` must be greater than 0; `s` is 0; `start` is less than `end`; `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`; `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`.**
