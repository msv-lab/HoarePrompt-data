The code updates the value of `mini` by comparing its current value with the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 0; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is greater than 0; `end` is `len(lst) - 1`; `inc` is 1; `m` is the number of iterations; `s` is 0; `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`.**
