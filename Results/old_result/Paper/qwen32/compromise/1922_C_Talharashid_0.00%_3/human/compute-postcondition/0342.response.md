The code snippet assigns the value of the new input integer to the variable `m`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 0; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes key-value pairs `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 1 to `len(lst) - 1`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes key-value pairs `d2[start] = s` for each `start` from `len(lst) - 1` to 1; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is 0; `end` is 0; `inc` is -1; `m` is the new input integer; `s` is the cumulative sum of the absolute differences as described in the loop body.**
