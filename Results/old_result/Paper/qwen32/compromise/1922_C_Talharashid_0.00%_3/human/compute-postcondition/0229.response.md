To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(s1, s2))` statement, we need to understand the context provided by the initial state and the calculations involved.

### Breakdown of the Initial State and Calculations

1. **Variables and Data Structures:**
   - `t`: An integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i`: Calculated as `t - 1`.
   - `d1`: A `defaultdict` with keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` and values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point.
   - `d2`: A `defaultdict` with keys from `len(lst) - 2` down to `0` and values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point.
   - `n`: A new input integer.
   - `lst`: A list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`.
   - `start` and `end`: These are indices adjusted by subtracting 1 from their original values.
   - `inc`: Set to `-1`.
   - `m`: Must be greater than 0.
   - `s`: Initialized to 0.

2. **Cumulative Sums in `d1` and `d2`:**
   - `d1` stores cumulative sums from the start of the list to each index.
   - `d2` stores cumulative sums from the end of the list to each index.

3. **Calculation of `s1` and `s2`:**
   - If `start` is less than `end`:
     - `s1` is calculated as `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`.
     - `s2` is calculated as `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`.
   - Otherwise:
     - `s1` is calculated as `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`.
     - `s2` is calculated as `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.

4. **Output Statement:**
   - The `print(min(s1, s2))` statement prints the minimum of `s1` and `s2`.

### Explanation of the Output

Given the calculations, `s1` and `s2` represent the absolute differences between cumulative sums from two different directions (start to end and end to start, respectively). The output will be the smaller of these two differences.

### Final Output

Since the exact values of `d1`, `d2`, `start`, and `end` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **min(s1, s2) (where s1 is abs(d1[end] - d1[start]) if start < end else abs(d2[end] - d2[start]), and s2 is abs(d2[start] - d2[end]) if start < end else abs(d1[start] - d1[end]))**
