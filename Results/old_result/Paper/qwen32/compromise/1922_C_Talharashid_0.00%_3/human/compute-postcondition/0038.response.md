The code updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start + 1` in the list `lst`. The values of `start`, `end`, and the elements of `lst` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`start` is less than `end`; `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`.**
