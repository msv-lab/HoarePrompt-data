The given code snippet updates the value of `mini` by taking the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `mini` is initially set to either `abs(lst[1] - lst[2])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, otherwise it is `11111111`.
- `start` is 1.

After executing the line `mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)`, the value of `mini` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and `abs(lst[1] - lst[0])`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `end` with values of `s` after each iteration, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d2[start]` is `s`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `start` is 1, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[1] - lst[0])` and the previous value of `mini`.**
