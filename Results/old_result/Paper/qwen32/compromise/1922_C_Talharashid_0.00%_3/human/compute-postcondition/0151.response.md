To ensure that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of the variables that are part of the loop condition. In this case, the loop condition is `start != end`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `start` is not equal to `end`.

Given the current state:
- `start` is 1
- `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, which is at least 1

Since `end` is at least 1, and `start` is 1, the condition `start != end` will be true if `len(lst) > 2` (because `end` would be at least 2). If `len(lst) == 2`, then `end` would be 1, and `start` would also be 1, making `start != end` false, and the loop would not execute again.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `start` is not equal to `end`. This can be achieved by ensuring that `len(lst) > 2`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t-1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and the key `start` has the value `s`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with at least 3 elements; `start` is 1; `end` is `len(lst) - 1` which is at least 2; `inc` is 1; `m` is the total number of iterations that have been executed; `s1` and `s2` are as previously defined based on `start` and `end`. If `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`. `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` (if `start - 1` is greater than -1) and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` (if `start + 1 < len(lst)`), with 11111111 as the default value where applicable.**

This ensures that `start` (which is 1) is not equal to `end` (which is at least 2), allowing the loop to execute one more time.
