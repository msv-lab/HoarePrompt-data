To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `while start != end:`. Therefore, we can only adjust the states of `start` and `end`.

Given:
- `start` is initialized to 1.
- `end` is initialized to `len(lst) - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `start` must not be equal to `end`. If `start` is equal to `end`, the loop will terminate. Thus, we need to ensure that `start` is not equal to `end`.

Here's the analysis:
- If `start` is less than `end`, the loop can execute one more time.
- If `start` is equal to `end`, the loop will not execute one more time.

Since the loop condition is `while start != end:`, we need to ensure that `start` remains less than `end` for the loop to proceed. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `end` as long as it is correctly initialized to `len(lst) - 1`. The variable `start` should be adjusted to be less than `end`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `start` is less than `end`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `s` remains 0 or is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111, `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])`, and `abs(lst[0] - lst[-1])` if applicable, and `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` in the else case.**
