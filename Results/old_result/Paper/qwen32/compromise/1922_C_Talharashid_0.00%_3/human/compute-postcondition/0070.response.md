Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `end` with values of `s` after each iteration, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d2[start]` is `s`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `start` must be greater than 0, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1. If `start + 1 < len(lst)`, then `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.**
