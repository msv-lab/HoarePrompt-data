The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `start` and `end`. The previous values of `start` and `end` are overwritten. The values of `start` and `end` are used for further calculations involving `d1` and `d2` dictionaries to compute `s1` and `s2`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t + 1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from `len(lst) - 2` down to `0` with values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` and `end` are the two integers read from the new input minus 1; `inc` is `-1`; `m` must be greater than 0; `s` is 0. If `start` is less than `end`, then `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**

In simple terms, the variables `start` and `end` are updated to the new values read from the input, and the rest of the state remains unchanged.
