The code snippet provided is `d1[start] = s`. This line assigns the value of `s` to the key `start` in the dictionary `d1`. 

Since the previous value of `d1[start]` is not specified, we assume it was 0 (as `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0). After this operation, `d1[start]` will hold the value of `s`. 

No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 except `d1[start]` which is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `start` is less than `end` and is now `start + 1`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `mini` equals the minimum of its current value and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`, `s` is updated accordingly.**
