To determine the output of the `print(min(s1, s2))` statement, we need to break down the given initial state and understand how the variables `s1` and `s2` are calculated based on that state.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization and Input**:
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `lst` is a list of integers with length `n`.
   - `start` is the first input integer minus 2.
   - `end` is the second input integer minus 2.
   - `inc` is initialized to -1.
   - `s` is initialized to 0.
   - `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with default integer value of 0.

2. **Updating defaultdicts `d1` and `d2`**:
   - `d1` is updated with keys from 1 to `end` with values of `s` after each iteration.
   - `d2` is updated with keys from `len(lst) - 1` to `0` with corresponding values of `s` after each iteration.
   - `i` is updated by adding 2 in each iteration.

3. **Calculation of `s1` and `s2`**:
   - If `start` is less than `end`:
     - `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`
     - `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`
   - Otherwise:
     - `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`
     - `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`

4. **Output**:
   - The output will be the minimum of `s1` and `s2`.

Given the complexity and the dependency on the input values, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `s1` and `s2` without the specific input values. However, we can describe the output based on the logic provided.

Output: **min(s1, s2) (where s1 and s2 are calculated based on the values in defaultdicts d1 and d2, and the conditions on start and end)**
