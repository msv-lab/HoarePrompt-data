The code snippet provided initializes a new defaultdict `d2` with default integer values of 0. This does not affect the existing variables `t`, `i`, or `d1`. The values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0.**
