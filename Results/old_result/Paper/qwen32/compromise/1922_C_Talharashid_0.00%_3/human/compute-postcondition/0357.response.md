The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `start` and `end`. This affects the values of `start` and `end` but does not change the values of the other variables directly. The values of `start` and `end` are used in subsequent calculations to determine `s1` and `s2`, but since those calculations are not part of the given code snippet, they remain unchanged for now.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 1; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes key-value pairs `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 1 to `len(lst) - 1`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes key-value pairs `d2[start] = s` for each `start` from `len(lst) - 1` to 1; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` and `end` are the integers read from the input minus 1; `inc` is -1; `m` must be greater than 0; `s` is 0; if `start` is less than `end`, then `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**
