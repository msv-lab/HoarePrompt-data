The code snippet updates the cumulative sum `s` by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. Given the initial state, `start` is `1` and `inc` is `-1`, the code calculates `s += abs(lst[1] - lst[0])`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t-1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and key `start` with value `s`; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is `1`; `end` is `0`; `inc` is `-1`; `m` is `len(lst) - 1`; `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[1] - lst[0])`. If `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `lst[1]` and `lst[0]`, and `d2[start]` is updated to the current value of `s`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged.**

In natural language: The cumulative sum `s` is updated by adding the absolute difference between the second element and the first element of the list `lst`. The value of `mini` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `lst[1]` and `lst[0]` if `start - 1` is greater than `-1`. The value of `d2[start]` is updated to the current value of `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
