To ensure that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `start != end`. The variables `start` and `end` are the only ones that can be adjusted according to the requirement.

Here's the current state:
- `start` is less than `end` and has been incremented by `inc`.
- `end` is `len(lst) - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `start` must still be less than `end`. Since `start` has already been incremented by `inc`, we need to ensure that `start` is still less than `end` after this increment.

Given that `end` is `len(lst) - 1` and `len(lst) > 1`, `end` is at least 1. If `start` was initially less than `end`, incrementing `start` by `inc` (which is 1) should still keep `start` less than `end` unless `start` reaches `end` during the current iteration.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `start` is less than `end` after the increment. Since `start` has been incremented by `inc`, we need to ensure that the new value of `start` is still less than `end`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `start` is less than `end` after the increment. Since `start` has already been incremented, we need to ensure that the previous value of `start` was such that `start + inc < end`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `start` is less than `end` and has been incremented by `inc`.

To make sure the loop can execute one more time:
- `start` must be such that `start + inc < end`.

Since `inc` is 1, `start` must be less than `end - 1` before the increment.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 0; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes the key-value pair `d1[start] = s`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `end` is `len(lst) - 1`; `inc` is 1; `m` is the number of iterations; `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous `mini` if `start - 1 > -1`, otherwise `mini` remains unchanged; `mini` is also the minimum of 11111111 and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, otherwise `mini` remains unchanged; `start` is less than `end - 1` and `start` has been incremented by `inc`; If `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is either 2 or `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]) + 1`. Otherwise, `s` is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`. `d1[start]` is `s`.**
