To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables present in the `while` loop condition. The `while` loop condition is `start != end`, so we need to ensure that `start` and `end` are not equal.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `i` is 0
- `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes key-value pairs `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 1 to `len(lst) - 1`
- `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys
- `n` is the new input integer
- `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`
- `start` is `len(lst) - 1`
- `end` is 0
- `inc` is -1
- `m` is the number of iterations
- `s` is 0

The only variables in the loop head are `start` and `end`. To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need `start` to be different from `end`. Given that `start` is initialized to `len(lst) - 1` and `end` is initialized to 0, and since `len(lst) > 1`, `start` will indeed be greater than 0, making `start` and `end` different.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the initial state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 0; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes key-value pairs `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 1 to `len(lst) - 1`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is `len(lst) - 1`; `end` is 0; `inc` is -1; `m` is the number of iterations; `s` is 0**
