Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t-1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input; `start` is `len(lst) - 1`; `end` is 0; `inc` is -1; `m` is `len(lst) - 1`; `s` is 0; `s1` and `s2` are as previously defined based on `start` and `end`.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d2[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t-1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and key `start` with value `s`; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is `len(lst) - 2`; `end` is 0; `inc` is -1; `m` is `len(lst) - 1`. If `mini` was equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, then `s` remains 0. Otherwise, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`. If `start - 1` is greater than -1, `mini` is updated to the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `mini`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t-1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and key `start` with value `s`; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is `len(lst) - 3`; `end` is 0; `inc` is -1; `m` is `len(lst) - 1`. If `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` is incremented by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`. If `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged. `d2[start]` is updated to the current value of `s`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t-1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and key `start` with value `s`; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is `start + inc`; `end` is `0`; `inc` is `-1`; `m` is `len(lst) - 1`; If `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[1] - lst[0])`; If `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `lst[1]` and `lst[0]`, and `d2[start]` is updated to the current value of `s`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged; `d2[start]` is updated to the current value of `s`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
