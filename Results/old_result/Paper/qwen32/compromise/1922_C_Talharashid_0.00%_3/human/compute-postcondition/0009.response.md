The code snippet provided initializes a variable `s` to 0. No other variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `s` is 0.**
