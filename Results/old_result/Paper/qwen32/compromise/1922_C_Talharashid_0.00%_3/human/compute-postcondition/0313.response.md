The code snippet `s += 1` increments the value of the variable `s` by 1. None of the other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 0; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes key-value pairs `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 1 to `len(lst) - 1`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is `len(lst) - 1`; `end` is 0; `inc` is -1; `m` is the number of iterations; `s` is 1; `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.**
