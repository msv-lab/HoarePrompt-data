Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program simply counts the number of duplicate cards in the player's hand and subtracts this from the total number of cards, which does not account for the optimal play strategy by Nene and the alternating turns.

The problem requires a more sophisticated approach to simulate the game and determine the maximum points the player can get, considering Nene's optimal moves. The current program does not implement any logic to simulate the game turns or account for the strategy of both players.

Here's a brief outline of what a correct solution might involve:
1. Count the occurrences of each card in the player's hand.
2. Simulate the game turns, taking into account the optimal play by Nene.
3. Track the points the player earns by placing cards on the table.
4. Return the maximum points the player can achieve.

Given the complexity of the problem, a correct solution would involve more advanced logic than what is provided in the current program.
