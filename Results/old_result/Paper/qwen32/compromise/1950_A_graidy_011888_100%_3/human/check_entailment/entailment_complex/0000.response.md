Reasoning:  
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither, based on the conditions specified in the problem description. 

- The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
- For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- It then checks the conditions:
  - If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
  - If `a < b` and `b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
  - Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

The logic in the program matches the problem's requirements. The example provided in the problem description is also correctly handled by the program, as demonstrated by the expected output.

Therefore, based on the given problem description and the annotated program, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
