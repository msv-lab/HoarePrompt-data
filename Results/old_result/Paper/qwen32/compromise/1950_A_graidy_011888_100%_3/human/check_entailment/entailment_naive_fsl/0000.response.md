Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies whether the three digits form a "STAIR", a "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the given conditions. The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads three digits and checks the conditions:
- If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
- If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
- Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

The conditions cover all possible scenarios for the three digits:
- A strictly increasing sequence (stair).
- A peak where the middle digit is the largest.
- Any other combination that does not fit the above two conditions (NONE).

The program handles all edge cases, including when all digits are the same or when the digits are in a strictly decreasing order. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case as described in the problem statement.
