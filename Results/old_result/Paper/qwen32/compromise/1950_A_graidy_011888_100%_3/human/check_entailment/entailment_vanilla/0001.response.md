Reasoning: 
1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. It then iterates `t` times, each time reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. For each set of integers, it checks:
   - If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
   - If `a < b` and `b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".
4. The conditions for "STAIR" and "PEAK" are correctly implemented according to the problem description.
5. The program handles all possible cases for the three digits, including scenarios where all digits are the same or form neither a stair nor a peak.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the required logic and handles all possible inputs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
