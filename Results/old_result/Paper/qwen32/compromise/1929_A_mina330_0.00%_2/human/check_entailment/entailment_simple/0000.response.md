Reasoning:  
The program is intended to calculate the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the strategy is to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones. 

The approach taken in the program is to sort the array and then calculate the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest, and so on. This ensures that the positive differences are maximized.

Let's verify this with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `3`, `2 1 3`
   - Sorted: `1 2 3`
   - Calculated beauty: `(3 - 1) + (2 - 2) = 2`
   - Output: `2`
   - Correct

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `3`, `69 69 69`
   - Sorted: `69 69 69`
   - Calculated beauty: `(69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0`
   - Output: `0`
   - Correct

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `5`, `100 54 80 43 90`
   - Sorted: `43 54 80 90 100`
   - Calculated beauty: `(100 - 43) + (90 - 54) + (80 - 80) = 57`
   - Output: `57`
   - Correct

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `4`, `3 4 3 3`
   - Sorted: `3 3 3 4`
   - Calculated beauty: `(4 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 1`
   - Output: `1`
   - Correct

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `2`, `2 1`
   - Sorted: `1 2`
   - Calculated beauty: `(2 - 1) = 1`
   - Output: `1`
   - Correct

The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting and then summing the differences between corresponding elements from the ends towards the center.

Correctness: **True**
