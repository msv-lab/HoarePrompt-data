To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem statement and the program's logic.

The problem requires us to maximize the beauty of the array defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. To maximize this sum, we should arrange the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then considering the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest, and so on.

The provided program does the following:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.
3. It sorts the array.
4. It calculates the beauty by summing up the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest, and so on.
5. It prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

Let's take a closer look at the logic of the program:
- Sorting the array is a good first step to maximize the beauty.
- The loop `for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1)` iterates through half of the array, which is correct because we are pairing the largest with the smallest, the second largest with the second smallest, etc.
- Inside the loop, `kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` correctly calculates the difference between the i-th largest and i-th smallest elements and adds it to the total beauty.

The program's logic is correct, and it efficiently computes the maximum beauty of the array for each test case.

Therefore, the response is:
Correctness: **True**
