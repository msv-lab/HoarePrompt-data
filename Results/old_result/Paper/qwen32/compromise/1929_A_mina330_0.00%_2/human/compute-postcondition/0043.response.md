Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, until it reaches the middle of the list. It then prints this sum for each test case.**
