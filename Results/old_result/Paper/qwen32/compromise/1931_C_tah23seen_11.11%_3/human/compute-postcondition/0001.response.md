The code assigns the value of `len(arr) - 1` to the variable `j`. Since `arr` is a list of integers with length `n`, `len(arr)` is equal to `n`. Therefore, `j` is assigned the value `n - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and n is the length of the list arr; i is 0; j is n - 1**.
