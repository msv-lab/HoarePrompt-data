You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    print(func_1(expression, length))

def func_1(expression, length):
    count = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            count += 1
    sub = length - count
    return abs(sub - count)



- Function Summary: 
The function calculates and returns the absolute difference between the number of '-' characters and the number of '+' characters in the given expression string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array as described in the problem statement. The program simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and returns the absolute difference between these counts, which does not align with the logic required to minimize the penalty.

Let's consider a few cases to illustrate the issue:

1. **Test Case:**
   ```
   1
   4
   ++--
   ```
   - **Expected Output:** 0
   - **Explanation:** The string `++--` can be split into `([1, 1], [-1, -1])` or `([1], [1], [-1], [-1])` both of which result in a penalty of 0.
   - **Program Output:** 0
   - **Explanation:** The program counts 2 '+' and 2 '-', and returns `abs(2 - 2) = 0`, which is correct for this case.

2. **Test Case:**
   ```
   1
   5
   +----+
   ```
   - **Expected Output:** 4
   - **Explanation:** The string `+----+` can be split into `([1], [-1, -1, -1, -1], [1])` resulting in a penalty of `1 + 4 + 1 = 6`. However, the optimal split is `([1, -1, 1, -1], [-1, 1])` which results in a penalty of `0 + 2 = 2`. But the optimal split is actually `([1, -1], [1, -1], [-1, 1])` which results in a penalty of `0 + 0 + 2 = 2`. However, the optimal split is `([1, -1, 1, -1, -1, 1])` which results in a penalty of `0 + 4 = 4`.
   - **Program Output:** 4
   - **Explanation:** The program counts 2 '+' and 3 '-', and returns `abs(2 - 3) = 1`, which is incorrect.

3. **Test Case:**
   ```
   1
   6
   +-+-+-
   ```
   - **Expected Output:** 0
   - **Explanation:** The string `+-+-+-` can be split into `([1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1])` resulting in a penalty of `0`.
   - **Program Output:** 0
   - **Explanation:** The program counts 3 '+' and 3 '-', and returns `abs(3 - 3) = 0`, which is correct for this case.

From the above examples, it is clear that the program does not always produce the correct minimum penalty. Specifically, it does not implement the logic to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Incorrect Case:**
```
1
5
+----+
```
- **Expected Output:** 2
- **Program Output:** 1

The program does not handle the optimal splitting logic correctly, hence it is incorrect.
