Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task requires finding the minimum possible penalty when splitting the array optimally, based on the defined penalty rules. However, the function `func_1` simply calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the expression string and returns that value. This does not consider any splitting of the array or the penalty calculation rules provided in the problem statement.

The function does not implement any logic to split the array into subarrays, calculate the penalty for each subarray, and then sum these penalties to find the minimum possible total penalty. The provided logic is incorrect for the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
