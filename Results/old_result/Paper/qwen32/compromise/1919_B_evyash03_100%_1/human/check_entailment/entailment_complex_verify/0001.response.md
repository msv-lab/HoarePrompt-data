### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires splitting the string `s` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty for a subarray `c` of length `m` is defined as `|sum(c)| * m`.
   - The strategy should ideally aim to create subarrays with a sum of zero to minimize the penalty.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The provided program counts the number of `+` characters in the string.
   - It calculates the number of `-` characters by subtracting the count of `+` from the total length of the string.
   - It returns the absolute difference between the count of `+` and `-`.

3. **Issues in the Provided Program**:
   - The program does not attempt to split the string into subarrays to minimize the penalty.
   - It simply calculates the difference between the counts of `+` and `-` and returns the absolute value of this difference. This does not address the requirement to split the string and calculate penalties for each subarray.

4. **Verification Using Annotated Code**:
   - The annotations confirm that the function `func_1` calculates the absolute difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters in the expression string.
   - This calculation does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the penalty by splitting the string into subarrays.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem. It fails to consider the optimal splitting of the string into subarrays to minimize the penalty.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
