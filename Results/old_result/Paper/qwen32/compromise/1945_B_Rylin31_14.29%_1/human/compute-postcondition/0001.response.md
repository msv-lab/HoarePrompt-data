For the given task, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1 since `range(t)` will generate numbers from 0 to `t-1`.

Given that `t` is an integer read from the input and is already within the range 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. However, the variable `i` is initialized by the `range` function and does not need to be set before the loop starts, as it will automatically take the first value in the range when the loop begins.

Thus, the state before the loop starts is already suitable for the loop to execute, and no adjustments are necessary for the variables in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
