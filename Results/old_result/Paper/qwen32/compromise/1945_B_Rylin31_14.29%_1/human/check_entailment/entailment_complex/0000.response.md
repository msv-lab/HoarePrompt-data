### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Two installations launch fireworks every `a` and `b` minutes respectively.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The maximum number of fireworks visible will occur at some point where the fireworks from both installations are overlapping.
   - To find this, we consider the point `mn = min(a, b) + m`. This is because fireworks launched up to `mn` minutes from the start will be visible during the same period, and we want to maximize the overlap.

3. **Counting Fireworks:**
   - The number of fireworks from the first installation visible at time `mn` is `mn // a`.
   - The number of fireworks from the second installation visible at time `mn` is `mn // b`.
   - The total number of fireworks visible at this time is `mn // a + mn // b`.

4. **Special Case Handling:**
   - If `m` is a multiple of both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, it implies that fireworks from both installations could be launched at the same time and remain visible for the entire duration `m`. This adds one more firework to the count.

5. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code correctly calculates `mn = min(a, b) + m`.
   - It then calculates the number of fireworks visible from both installations at `mn`.
   - It checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, and adjusts the count accordingly.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously based on the problem description. It handles the special case where fireworks from both installations overlap completely during their visibility period.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
