You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))

def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of test cases, each consisting of scores for three players. It calculates and returns a list of integers where each integer represents the number of matches that ended in a draw for the corresponding test case, or -1 if the scores do not meet the specified conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Total Points Check**: The program first checks if the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) are even. This is correct because every game results in a total of 2 points being awarded (either 2-0 or 1-1). If the total points are odd, it's impossible to have a valid set of games, so the program correctly returns `-1`.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**: The program calculates the total number of matches that must have been played by dividing the total points by 2. This is also correct.

3. **Maximum Matches Check**: The program checks if the total number of matches is more than 3 or if the highest score `p3` is greater than the total number of matches. This is also correct because if `p3` is greater than the total number of matches, it means one player has more points than the total number of matches, which is impossible. Similarly, since there are only three players, the maximum number of matches is 3 (each pair can play at most once).

4. **Draws Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This formula is intended to determine the number of points that are not due to wins (i.e., points due to draws). The formula seems correct because:
   - `2 * (p3 - p2)` accounts for the points `p3` has over `p2` due to wins.
   - `2 * (p3 - p1)` accounts for the points `p3` has over `p1` due to wins.
   - Subtracting these from the total points leaves the points that must be due to draws.

5. **Draws Validation**: The program checks if the calculated number of points due to draws (`egalites`) is negative. If it is, the scores are inconsistent, and the program correctly returns `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the number of draws by dividing `egalites` by 2 (since each draw contributes 2 points).

However, there is an issue in the test cases provided in the program. The test case `(0, 2, 3)` in `cas_de_test` should be `(1, 1, 1)` as per the problem statement's example 3, which should return `-1` because it's impossible to have scores of 0, 2, and 3.

Given the above analysis, the program logic seems correct, but the provided test cases need to be accurate for the program to be considered correct. Since the test case `(0, 2, 3)` is incorrect, the program's correctness is dependent on the input data being accurate. Assuming the test cases were correct, the program would be correct.

Correctness: **False** (due to the incorrect test case in the provided input)

If we correct the test case to `(1, 1, 1)` and re-run the program, then:

Correctness: **True**
