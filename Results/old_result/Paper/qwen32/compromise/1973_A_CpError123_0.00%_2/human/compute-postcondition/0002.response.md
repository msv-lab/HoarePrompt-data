To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the transformations applied to the `resultats` list based on the conditions in the loop. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The `resultats` list starts as an empty list.
2. **Loop Iteration**: For each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` in `cas_de_test`, the loop calculates `total_points` as the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
3. **Condition Checks**:
   - If `total_points` is odd, `-1` is appended to `resultats`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.
   - If `total_points` is even, the code calculates `total_matchs` as `total_points // 2`.
   - If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or if `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `-1` is appended to `resultats`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the code calculates `egalites` as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - If `egalites` is less than 0, `-1` is appended to `resultats`.
   - Otherwise, `egalites // 2` is appended to `resultats`.

After the loop has processed all tuples in `cas_de_test`, the `resultats` list will contain either `-1` or the calculated number of draws (`egalites // 2`) for each tuple.

The output state will be the `resultats` list after all iterations, with `t` and `cas_de_test` remaining unchanged.

Output State: **resultats is a list of integers calculated based on the conditions described, t is unchanged, and cas_de_test is unchanged.**
