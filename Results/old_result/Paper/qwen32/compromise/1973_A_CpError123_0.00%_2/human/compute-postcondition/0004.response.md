Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `cas_de_test` containing `t` tuples. Each tuple consists of three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of three players. The function returns a list `resultats` containing integers calculated based on the conditions described for each test case.**
