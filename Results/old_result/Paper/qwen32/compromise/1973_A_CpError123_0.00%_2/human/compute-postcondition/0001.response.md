To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `cas_de_test`. The loop will execute if `cas_de_test` contains at least one tuple. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be assigned from the first tuple in `cas_de_test` during the first iteration.

Given that `resultats` is an empty list and `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, we need to ensure that `cas_de_test` has at least one tuple to make the loop execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, `cas_de_test` must contain at least one tuple, `resultats` is an empty list, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the values from the first tuple in `cas_de_test`**
