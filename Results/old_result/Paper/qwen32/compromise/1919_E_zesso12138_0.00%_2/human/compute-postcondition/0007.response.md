The value of `n` is reassigned to the integer value of the element at index 1 of the `data` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`, where `|p_i| <= n` for each element `p_i` in `p`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace; `index` is 1; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is an empty list.**
