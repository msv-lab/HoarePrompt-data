The code increments the value of `index` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `p`, `data`, `t`, `results`, and `result`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*n]`; `p` is a list of integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace; `index` is `4 + 2*n`; `t` is an integer value greater than 0 and one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value of `result`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.
