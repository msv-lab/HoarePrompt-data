The given code snippet updates the list `p` by mapping the string elements from `data` (which is a list of strings) to integers. Specifically, it takes the slice of `data` starting from `index` to `index + n` and converts each element in this slice to an integer.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*n]`.
- `p` is initially a list of integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace.
- `index` is `4 + 2*n`.
- `t` is an integer value greater than 0 and one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value of `result`.
- `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.

After executing the line `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`, the list `p` will now contain the integer values of the corresponding slice of `data`.

Since `index` is `4 + 2*n`, the slice `data[index:index + n]` corresponds to `data[4 + 2*n:4 + 3*n]`. Each element in this slice is converted to an integer and stored in `p`.

Therefore, the updated `p` will be a list of integers derived from the string elements in `data` from index `4 + 2*n` to `4 + 3*n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*n]`; `p` is a list of integers from `data[4 + 2*n]` to `data[4 + 3*n - 1]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace; `index` is `4 + 2*n`; `t` is an integer value greater than 0 and one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value of `result`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.
