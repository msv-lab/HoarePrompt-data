Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (at least 1); `p` is a list of integers of length `n`; `dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1`; `offset` is `n`; `new_dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1`. If `dp[j]` is greater than 0 and `j - 1 >= 0`, then `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. If `dp[j]` is not greater than 0 or `j - 1` is less than 0, `new_dp` remains unchanged. `i` is 3; `j` is 2.**
