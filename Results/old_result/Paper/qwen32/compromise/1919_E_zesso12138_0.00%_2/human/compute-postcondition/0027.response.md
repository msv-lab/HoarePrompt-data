To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to generalize the pattern observed in the first three iterations. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of iterations, which is the integer value of `data[0]`.
   - `results` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `index` starts at 1.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration `_` in the range `t`:
     - `n` is read from `data[index]`.
     - `p` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index + 1]` to `data[index + n]`.
     - `index` is incremented by `n + 1` to point to the start of the next `n` and `p`.
     - `result` is computed by calling `func_1(n, p)`.
     - `results` appends `result`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After `t` iterations, `index` will have been incremented `t` times by `n + 1` for each iteration.
   - `results` will contain `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, p)` for the corresponding `n` and `p`.

Based on this pattern, the final output state can be described as follows:

- `n` will be the integer value of `data[index]` from the last iteration.
- `p` will be the list of integers from `data[index + 1]` to `data[index + n]` from the last iteration.
- `data` remains the same list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace.
- `index` will be `1 + t * (n + 1)` after all iterations, where `n` is the size of the last `p`.
- `t` remains the same integer value as initially set from `data[0]`.
- `results` will be a list containing `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each respective iteration.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1 + (t-1)*(n+1)]`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[2 + (t-1)*(n+1)]` to `data[1 + t*(n+1)]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace, `index` is `1 + t * (n + 1)`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the value of `result` from each iteration.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `index` points just past the last `p` list processed, `results` contains `t` results from each iteration, and all other variables remain consistent with their roles throughout the loop.
