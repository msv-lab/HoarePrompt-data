You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array a, and p is a list of n integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array a, where |p_i| <= n for each element p_i in p.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(n, p)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: `n` is the integer value of `data[1 + (t-1)*(n+1)]`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[2 + (t-1)*(n+1)]` to `data[1 + t*(n+1)]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace, `index` is `1 + t * (n + 1)`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the value of `result` from each iteration.
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State: All elements in `results` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the size of a hidden array `a`, and `p`, which is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`, where the absolute value of each element `p_i` in `p` is less than or equal to `n`. The function returns the hidden array `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
