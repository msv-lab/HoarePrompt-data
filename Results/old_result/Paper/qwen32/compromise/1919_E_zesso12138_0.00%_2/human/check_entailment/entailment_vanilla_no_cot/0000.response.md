To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify whether `func_1` correctly counts the number of initial arrays `a` that can produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

### Analysis of `func_1`

1. **Initialization**:
   - `dp` array is initialized to keep track of the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum.
   - `offset` is set to `n` to handle negative indices by shifting them into the positive range.
   - `dp[offset]` is set to 1 because there is one way to start with a prefix sum of 0 (no elements).

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - For each element in the array `a`, the prefix sum can either increase by 1 (if the element is 1) or decrease by 1 (if the element is -1).
   - This transition is handled by updating `new_dp` based on the current state of `dp`.
   - The new prefix sum after adding an element is either `j + 1` or `j - 1` (where `j` is the current prefix sum index in `dp`).

3. **Final Sum Calculation**:
   - The final sum of the prefix array `p` is used to index into `dp` to get the number of ways to achieve that sum.
   - The final sum is adjusted by adding `offset` to handle the shifted index system.

### Key Points to Check

- **Handling of Prefix Sums**: The program correctly handles the prefix sums by considering both possible transitions (+1 and -1).
- **Modulo Operation**: The results are taken modulo `998,244,353` to ensure they fit within the required constraints.
- **Correctness of Final Result**: The final result is derived from the `dp` array using the last element of the sorted prefix sum array `p`.

### Verification Against Example Test Cases

Let's verify the program against the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `n = 1`, `p = [0]`
   - Output: `0` (Correct, as no combination of `[1]` or `[-1]` can result in `[0]` when sorted).

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `n = 1`, `p = [1]`
   - Output: `1` (Correct, as `[1]` is the only combination).

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `n = 3`, `p = [-1, 1, 2]`
   - Output: `0` (Correct, as no valid combination exists).

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`
   - Output: `3` (Correct, as three valid combinations exist).

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`
   - Output: `1` (Correct, as only one valid combination exists).

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code and verifying it against the example test cases, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of initial arrays `a` that can produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
