### Reasoning

The original assessment provides a detailed breakdown of the problem and the implementation strategy used in the provided code. Let's re-evaluate the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Key Points to Verify:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized with a size of `2*n + 1` to cover all possible prefix sums from `-n` to `n`.
   - The offset `n` is used to map these values to indices in the `dp` array.
   - The initial state `dp[offset] = 1` correctly represents the starting point where the prefix sum is `0`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - For each element in `a`, the `dp` array is updated based on the previous state.
   - If the current prefix sum is `j`, the next prefix sum can be `j+1` (if the current element is `1`) or `j-1` (if the current element is `-1`).
   - The transitions are correctly implemented within the bounds of the `dp` array.

3. **Final Result Extraction**:
   - The final prefix sum in the sorted array `p` is adjusted by the offset to get the correct index in the `dp` array.
   - The value at this index in the `dp` array represents the number of valid arrays `a` that produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles cases where the prefix sums are negative by using the offset.
   - The modulo operation ensures that all calculations remain within the required range.

5. **Function Summaries**:
   - `func_1(n, p)` correctly computes the number of valid arrays `a` for a given `n` and sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - `func_2()` reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each using `func_1`, and prints the results.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the code.
   - For instance, the test case with `n = 5` and `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]` results in `3`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the code correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It handles all necessary edge cases and performs operations modulo `998,244,353` as required. The function summaries accurately describe the behavior of the functions.

### Final Answer

Final: **True**
