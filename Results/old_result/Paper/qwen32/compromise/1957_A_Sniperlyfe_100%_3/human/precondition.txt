arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases, followed by t pairs of lists. Each pair consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks available, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the stick lengths.
