The code snippet `s = str(input())` assigns the variable `s` the value of the user's input converted to a string. The values of `t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is the highest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<', `mak2` is the highest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<', `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the user's input as a string.**
