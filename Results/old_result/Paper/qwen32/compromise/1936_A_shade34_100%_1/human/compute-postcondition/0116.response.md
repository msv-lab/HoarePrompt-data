The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Let's summarize the adjustments needed:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- `n` should remain greater than the new value of `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `mak` is updated to the previous value of `i` plus 1 if `s` is '<', otherwise `mak` remains the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<'. `mak2` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<'. `pans` is a list containing the current value of `i` if `s` is '<', otherwise it contains the previous value of `i` if `s` is '='. `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, and `s` is the string input by the user.**

Since we are only adjusting the loop head variables:
State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `n` is greater than `i`**
