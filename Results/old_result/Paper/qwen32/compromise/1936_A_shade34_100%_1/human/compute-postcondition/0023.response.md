To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and Their Descriptions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n`: An integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\).
   - `mak`: The largest index \(i\) (from 1 to \(n-1\)) where the input was `'<'`.
   - `mak2`: Equal to `mak`.
   - `pans`: An empty list.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is `print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)`.
   - It prints the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`.

3. **Values of Variables:**
   - `mak` and `mak2` are both described as the same value, which is the largest index \(i\) (from 1 to \(n-1\)) where the input was `'<'`.
   - The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. Since it is not initialized or assigned any value, it would result in a `NameError` if the code were to run as is. However, based on the context of the question, it seems like `i` might be intended to be the same as `mak` or `mak2`, but since it is not explicitly stated, we must consider it undefined.

Given the above analysis, the precise output cannot be determined due to the undefined variable `i`. However, we can still describe the expected output assuming `i` were to be defined similarly to `mak` or `mak2`.

Let's assume for the sake of explanation that `i` is also intended to be the same as `mak` or `mak2` (which is a common assumption in such problems when a variable is not explicitly defined).

**Assuming `i` is intended to be the same as `mak` or `mak2`:**

Output: **? [mak] [mak] [mak] [mak] (where [mak] is the largest index i from 1 to n-1 where the input was '<')**

However, since `i` is not defined, the actual execution would raise an error. Therefore, the most accurate response based on the given information is:

Output: **? [mak] [mak] NameError: name 'i' is not defined [mak] (where [mak] is the largest index i from 1 to n-1 where the input was '<')**

But strictly adhering to the format and assuming `i` should be the same as `mak`:

Output: **? [mak] [mak] [mak] [mak] (where [mak] is the largest index i from 1 to n-1 where the input was '<')**
