The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution condition. The loop's execution depends on the input provided to `int(input())`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the variables `t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain unchanged. The loop will execute as long as the input provided to `int(input())` is a positive integer.

Since the loop head does not involve any of the variables mentioned (`t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`), we only need to consider the input for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state remains the same for the variables `t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans`. The only change would be due to the input for the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `'>'` (or 0 if no such input was received), `mak2` is equal to its previous value, and `pans` is unchanged.**
