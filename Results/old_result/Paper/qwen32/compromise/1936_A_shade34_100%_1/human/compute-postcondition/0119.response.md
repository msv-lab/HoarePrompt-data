`s` is assigned the value of `str(input())`, where `input()` takes an input from the user and `str()` converts it to a string. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, with `i` still being the previous value of `i` plus 1, and `n` still being greater than `i`.

Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `s` is the input string**.
